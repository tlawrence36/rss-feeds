      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Antoine Fuqua always knew Nelson Mandela as an icon. But he had no idea he was such a rebel too, and a literal fighter. He remembered walking into a restaurant and seeing a picture of a man in a boxing stance and asked why they had a poster of Muhammad Ali on the wall. They didn\u2019t, he was told: It was Mandela.",
      "It was just part of what would be an enlightening journey in making the new documentary, \u201cTroublemaker,\u201d which has its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "\u201cHe evolved into the Mandela that we all know and love,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cThe troublemaker allows you to sort of see him not just a mythical character or as a global icon, but as a fallible human being, someone who became a great leader, who in the beginning was a rebel, if you will, and who was willing to engage in violence at some point, if necessary, for the greater good.\u201d",
      "The film uses Mandela\u2019s own voice, drawn from over 70 hours of recordings to tell the story of the struggle against apartheid. Fuqua collaborated closely with Mac Maharaj, an anti-apartheid activist, who was imprisoned on Robben Island with Mandela and who played a key part in smuggling Mandela\u2019s writings, which would become \u201cLong Walk to Freedom,\u201d out of the prison",
      "Fuqua, Maharaj and the filmmaking team traveled all around South Africa, visiting important locations in Mandela\u2019s story, from the University of Fort Hare, where Mandela was a student before being expelled for protest activities, and Robben Island, where he was imprisoned from 1964 to 1982, to Qunu, his final resting place.",
      "He even slept a few nights on Robben Island, which he said was \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d While there they got a feeling for where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 imprisoned years and bonded at night over dinners. That\u2019s where Maharaj told him Mandela was a Tracy Chapman fan.",
      "They met many people along the way, including some who were part of the resistance against apartheid, taking to heart their continued optimism and hope despite past and present grievances and racism.",
      "\u201cOne gentleman came in and he had no arm, his eye was missing. He looked like a character out of James Bond. He had a Tommy Bahama shirt on, he had the hat on,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cAnd he was so full of life and so funny and so matter of fact about what happened to him, fighting for justice. I started to learn so much more about the people there.\u201d",

      "Over the course of his career, Mason worked on eight Olympics. As a young producer on Sept. 5, 1972, he was in the control room in Munich, Germany, when the Palestinian militant group Black September stormed the Olympic village and took Israeli Olympic team members hostage.",

The international broadcast center in Munich was 100 yards away from where the hostage crisis was taking place in the Olympic village.",
      "The movie recreates the moment when West German police stormed the control room and pointed guns at Mason\u2019s face.

      "The 33-year-old pop star from Essex has been in the music industry since she was 16, with a career trajectory that she described as anything but straight forward. Then, in 2024, it hit a crescendo with her sixth studio album, \u201cBrat,\u201d which became a pop culture phenomenon. Finally, she said, she felt understood for a moment. And then, just as quickly, it changed.",
      "\u201cThere was this sort of, kind of, you know, persona that people really associated me with and then there were a lot of expectations put on me as a person, as an artist, of who I was then supposed to be. And I didn\u2019t fit into that sort of narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cI had got to this place where I was finally feeling so understood. Then I was like not understood again.\u201d",
      "Making something immensely popular and resonant can be a double-edged sword for an artist working in a business that would sometimes rather milk the \u201csure thing\u201d forever than let someone evolve and move on. She found herself wanting to grapple with that tension, that existential conundrum that she\u2019d experienced.",
      "A straightforward documentary didn\u2019t seem like right approach, so she and Aidan Zamiri, the 30-year-old Scottish photographer and music video director, got to work on something else, something that felt truer to them. \u201cThe Moment\u201d is a little \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d a little \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d a little meta, with the likes of Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott playing themselves, a little funny and a little wild. It\u2019s heightened, but also true.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t lie, there are definitely some crossovers,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the choices that Charli in the film makes, but I\u2019ve definitely, like, come close to it. \u2026 It was a very accurate depiction of what I\u2019ve experienced in the music industry.\u201d",
      "One of the buzziest titles in a starry program, the A24 film will be in theaters faster than most: It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 30 and expands wide on Feb. 6.",
      "In \u201cThe Moment,\u201d Charli xcx is under pressure as Brat summer comes to an end, having to stage a concert film with Amazon, with a sleazy director not of her choosing played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, promote a Brat credit card, and fall in line with what music executives want from her. She\u2019s also not sleeping and getting increasingly frazzled about everything.",
      "Zamiri, who directed her \u201c360\u201d music video and has become one of her best friends, was excited by the challenge and to direct his first feature film. He also understood intrinsically what she was going through.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this battle of expectations and of people wanting one thing from you and you feeling this pressure too, to stick with it, to keep providing that one thing for fear that maybe that attention, that excitement about you will falter if the next thing they don\u2019t love,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI love the process of making stuff. But part of it, which is often really exciting but also weird, is the sharing with the world because then it\u2019s just no longer yours anymore \u2026 it becomes its own thing which I think we saw happen in real-time with Brat.\u201d",
      "As with the \u201cBrat\u201d album and everything she does, Charli xcx has been intimately involved in the marketing and promotion of the movie too.",

      "There\u2019s a palpable energy around \u201cThe Moment\u201d as it approaches its theatrical release. Charli xcx made sure that some fans actually got into the premiere, not just industry folks and those who could afford expensive festival passes. Afterward many celebrated into the wee hours of the morning at a DJ\u2019d party.",
      "\u201cI love all the fans wanting to roll up with their sunglasses on and their crop tops,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI get the feeling they\u2019ll show up for this like they would for a concert. That\u2019s the coolest thing ever.\u201d",
      "The Sundance Film Festival was a kind of coronation for Charli xcx, the actor, with three films across the first weekend, including Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d where she played the uptight girlfriend of Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character, and Cathy Yan\u2019s \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d as an art world influencer type with bleached eyebrows. They\u2019re not her first on screen credits, but they do show her range in addition to her ability to carry a film, even if she\u2019s playing a version of herself.",
      "It's a big moment for Charli xcx personally, too. She's a self-professed cinephile with a not-so-secret Letterboxd account, where she\u2019s logged 1,357 movies so far. In a recent review of \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d she wrote \u201clives up 2 the hype.\u201d Her four favorites are Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d David Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cMaps to the Stars,\u201d Jacques Rivette\u2019s \u201cC\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating\u201d and Abel Ferrera\u2019s \u201cThe Addiction.\u201d",

      "\u201cI really am sort of like desperate to like learn more and more and more about, you know, about every part of the film industry: Making a film, being in film.

      "Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office.",
      "NEW YORK -- With a winter storm blanketing a large swath of the country, Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office. The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release. The Shakespeare drama, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been in theaters for two months, steadily increasing its theatrical footprint. It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",
      "But newer releases struggled. \u201cReturn to Silent Hill,\u201d the third installment in a horror series kick-started with 2006's \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d opened with $3.2 million. Though Sony released the 2006 film and Open Road distributed the 2012 follow up, the low-budget \u201cReturn to Silent Hill\u201d was put out by Iconic Events.",
      "In its second week of release, \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d dropped swiftly. The Sony release, directed by Nia DaCosta, opened last week to a disappointing $13.3 million in sales despite good reviews. But its second weekend was even worse, dropping 71% with $3.6 million.",
      "Other new releases flopped. Roadside Attractions' \u201cH Is For Hawk,\u201d starring Claire Foy, took in just $150,000 from 472 theaters. Sony's \u201cClika,\u201d about a migrant worker with music aspirations, managed only $1.2 million in 522 locations.",

      "Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 508-meter (1,667-foot) tower about 90 minutes after he started. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head.",

      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.",

      "One of the latter comes from filmmaker Macon Blair, a Sundance veteran and grand jury prize winner for \u201cI Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore,\u201d whose new movie might best be described as a road movie gone wrong.",

      "\u201cWhen my dad could have created an empire, he created a nest,\u201d said his daughter, Amy Redford. \u201cThe Sundance Institute was designed to support and protect and nourish and then set free.\u201d",

      "The labs, which started in 1981, bring emerging storytellers to the rustic resort in northern Utah to nurture their talents under expert guidance and away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. Three of the five best director nominees at this year's Academy Awards \u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Ryan Coogler \u2014 came up through the labs.",
      "Zhao, whose film \u201cHamnet\u201d was nominated this week for eight Oscars, credited the screenwriting lab with jump-starting her career in 2012. Under the mentorship of Redford and program director Michelle Satter, she said she learned to trust her own vision and gained an invaluable community of creatives.",

      "\u201cI remember once seeing him walk some of the other fellows from the directors lab, and he just looked so full of love and pride for us, for what he built,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cAnd it was just very clear to me in that moment the depth to which he cared about this place and all of us.\u201d",
      "Sundance Film Festival regular Ethan Hawke recounted his first audition in front of Redford for the 1992 period drama \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d After forgoing sleep to prepare a lengthy monologue, Hawke said Redford pulled him aside to say he was too young for the part but would undoubtedly have a wonderful career.",

      "King Charles III has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film about his vision for saving the planet, 16 years after he wrote a book on the subject",
      "LONDON -- Can it be that, like many baby boomers, King Charles III feels misunderstood?",
      "That might sound like a strange question for a man with his own public relations team and easy access to any journalist in the realm. But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health. Then there were the continuing tensions with his younger son, Prince Harry, and the scandal surrounding his brother Andrew\u2019s links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Among those who is attending a course at Dumfries House is Jennie Regan, 45, who is training to be a stonemason after 15 years as a university administrator.",

      "The Sundance Film Festival is buzzing with excitement as Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde, and Charli XCX movies premiere back-to-back at the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival is in full swing, with Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx movies premiering back-to-back at the storied Eccles Theatre Friday evening in Park City, Utah. Considered some of the hottest tickets at the festival, the waitlists are already long, and the lines will surely be longer.",
      "First up is \u201cJosephine,\u201d writer-director Beth De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s raw drama about an 8-year-old girl (Mason Reeves) whose life and sense of safety is upended after she witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Gemma Chan play the parents who are unsure how to help her navigate these new emotions and fears. The film, which is part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition, is based on De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s own experience of seeing something scarring at that age.",
      "The next film, Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d will bring a distinct change in tone to the Eccles. It\u2019s the story of a college graduate in his early 20s (played by Cooper Hoffman ) who gets his first job as a kind of intern/assistant to a renowned art world provocateur named Erika Tracy (Wilde), who Arkai described as \u201cbold, daring and very controversial,\u201d a cross between Robert Mapplethorpe and Madonna.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the story of their affairs and the impact it has on this kid\u2019s life and how it kind of turns his whole world upside down,\u201d Araki told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it\u2019s sexy. And it\u2019s a ride.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a film that Araki has been working on for over 10 years, as it evolved from a comic \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a female intern to what it is now.",
      "\u201cAfter #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, all the stuff that was going on, it was literally like, I don\u2019t really want to see a woman getting dragged around by the hair,\u201d Araki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seed that kind of patriarchal dynamic, even if it\u2019s consensual.\u201d",
      "Flipping the gender roles and making the young intern a man made the movie more interesting for Araki, \u201cas a filmmaker who has always been heavily influenced by feminist film theory and feminism in general,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, he was absorbing news stories about Gen Z and how they don\u2019t have sex or relationships anymore and a new dynamic emerged.",
      "\u201cWhat I knew as an old person, as an old-timer, in terms of socialization, dating, sex, all of this stuff that seemed to be kind of falling away,\u201d Araki said. \u201cAnd so that kind of became a major theme of the movie.\u201d",
      "Things Wilde\u2019s character says are things he has also said in interviews about sex and sexuality. Her character gets into generational debates about it. And ultimately it's sex positive.",
      "\u201cIt was very important to me to make something sex positive,\u201d Araki said. \u201c\u2019I Want Your Sex\u2019 is like the opposite of \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 which I found to be very sex negative.\u201d",
      "The film also features a supporting turn from Charli xcx, who was a fan of Araki and whose \u201cBrat\u201d album cover was partially inspired by the title credits to his film \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d When she heard about this new movie, he said, she asked if she could be in it. He was interested, but told her agent that she needed to do a self-tape \u201clike everyone else\u201d to play the part of Hoffman\u2019s girlfriend.",

But prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation services have not kept pace on a largely youthful continent whose public health systems prioritize infectious diseases, maternal care and children.",
      "Many older people have little access to geriatricians or other doctors and tend to forego diagnostics or treatment to cut costs.",
      "The aquagym emerged little over a decade ago as a rare, low-cost option to relieve pain and improve mobility.",
      "After Sall was diagnosed with her autoimmune condition, she said her doctor told her she would need surgery at a cost of about $10,000, which she could not afford. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, but it was later taken off the market due to complications.",

      "NORTON, Zimbabwe -- Lesotho\u2019s Lishoeshoe soccer club was losing by four goals at halftime against South Africa\u2019s Mamelodi Sundowns in the final of a regional Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in Zimbabwe aimed at promoting cervical cancer vaccination. By fulltime, the gap had stretched to 5-0.",
      "Yet for Lishoeshoe winger Nteboheleng Leticia Sooane, the result felt beside the point.",
      "For the 16-year-old, the tournament\u2019s most important outcome had little to do with goalmouth scrambles or final-whistle disappointment. Instead, it was about building confidence among girls to trust the HPV vaccine and prevent a disease that kills a woman every two minutes globally \u2014 with the burden most acute in Africa, according to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the tournament\u2019s organizers.",
      "\u201cParticipating in the tournament was very good because we had to learn and spread (the message) even though we did not win the finals. So it was a good experience,\u201d Sooane said as she waited to collect her finalist\u2019s medal in a rain-soaked stadium in Norton, on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Sooane was among about 200 girls from six countries taking part in the CAF Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in December, organized by Africa\u2019s soccer governing body CAF together with the European soccer body, GAVI and health ministries from several African countries.",
      "Dubbed the Goal Getters campaign, the initiative was first showcased in Tanzania and Eswatini earlier last year before moving to Zimbabwe in December, using soccer to build awareness and trust in the HPV vaccine.",
      "Offered for free, the HPV vaccine being administered to girls aged between 9 and 14 years can prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, saving families thousands of dollars in treatment costs later in life if girls are not vaccinated, according to GAVI.",
      "After setbacks caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and uneven national immunization programs, Africa has intensified HPV vaccination drives in recent years. Coverage for at least one dose of the HPV vaccine rose to 40% in 2023 from 28% the previous year, behind only behind North, Central and South America, driven by expanded campaigns backed by governments and GAVI, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The girls\u2019 soccer tournament is a key part of that effort, said GAVI spokesman Olly Cann.",
      "\u201cOne of the great aspects of the Goal Getters campaign is that it enables us to blend two things that teenage girls are passionate about, one is sport and the other is health,\u201d said Cann. \u201cIt creates a really safe space where the girls can feel trusted, they can feel secure, they also feel empowered.\u201d",
      "The campaign\u2019s launch mixed dance and song before the eight-team tournament kicked off. On the sidelines, mothers streamed to a nearby clinic, some drawn by the chance to see well-known women\u2019s soccer figures, while also getting their children vaccinated against HPV.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common sexually transmitted virus and the primary cause of cervical cancer. While most infections clear naturally, some persist and can lead to cancer years later.",
      "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, killing about 350,000 women each year, according to the WHO. Africa accounts for nearly a quarter of global deaths, and 19 of the 20 most affected countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, Cann said.",

      "\u201cMany families are not bringing their children to the clinic to be vaccinated,\u201d said Barbara Mashonga, the nurse in charge of community mobilization at the clinic. \u201cEven when we follow up at schools, some refuse. The biggest challenge is religious beliefs.\u201d",

      "The 6-foot-7 inch Foege literally stood out in the field of public health. A whip-smart medical doctor with a calm demeanor, he had a canny knack for beating back infectious diseases.",
      "He was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later held other key leadership roles in campaigns against international health problems.",
      "But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.",
      "Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.",
      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",
      "The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in \"House on Fire,\" his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.",
      "It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Donald Trump announced America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\u201d he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t airborne, a stance it didn\u2019t officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",

But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",

China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week.

      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",

      "Spain's government has announced it will grant legal status to potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants living and working in the country without authorization",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government announced Tuesday it will grant legal status to potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants living and working in the country without authorization, the latest example of how the country has bucked a trend toward increasingly harsh immigration policies seen in the United States and much of Europe.",
      "Spain's Minister of Migration, Elma Saiz, announced the extraordinary measure following the weekly cabinet meeting. She said her government will amend existing immigration laws by expedited decree to grant immigrants who are living in Spain without authorization legal residency of up to one year as well as permission to work.",
      "The permits will apply to those who arrived in Spain before Dec. 31, 2025, and who can prove they have lived in Spain for at least five months. They must also prove they have no criminal record.",
      "\u201cToday is a historic day,\u201d Saiz told journalists during a press conference. The measure could benefit between 500,000 and 800,000 people estimated by different organizations to be living in the shadows of Spanish society. Many are Latin American or African immigrants working in the agricultural, tourism or service sectors, backbones of Spain's growing economy.",
      "The expedited decree bypasses a similar bill that has stalled in parliament. Saiz said she expects immigrants will be able to start applying for their legal status from April once the decree comes into force.",

      "Lopez said the indefinite grounding of all passenger ships of the ferry owner, Aleson Shipping Lines, Inc., would allow an inspection to determine their seaworthiness. Other companies would be allowed to deploy their ferries and the coast guard may provide free rides to prevent a major transport disruption in a region where ferries are the main mode of travel.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- In the last months of World War II, Lola Kantorowicz tried her best to hide her pregnancy. She succeeded because most of the prisoners at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp had bellies that were distended and bloated from extended starvation.",
      "As she went into labor in March 1945, the Russians were advancing through Germany, and Bergen-Belsen was in chaos. Her daughter, Ilana, was born on March 19, 30 days before the camp was liberated by the British.",
      "Now 81, Ilana Kantorowicz Shalem is among the youngest Holocaust survivors. She survived only because she was born when the Nazi leadership was in disarray as the war was ending. Otherwise, she most certainly would have been killed.",
      "More than eight decades after the end of the Holocaust, Shalem is sharing her story \u2014 and her mother\u2019s story \u2014 for the first time, realizing how few Holocaust survivors are left.",
      "International Holocaust Remembrance Day is observed across the world on Jan. 27, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the most notorious of the death camps where some 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, were killed. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2005 establishing the day as an annual commemoration.",
      "About 6 million European Jews and millions of other people, including Poles, Roma, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ people, were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators. Some 1.5 million were children.",
      "Commemorations this year are taking place amid a rise of antisemitism that gained traction during the two-year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Shalem\u2019s mother and father met as teenagers in the Tomaszow Ghetto in Poland. Lola Rosenblum was from the town, while Hersz (Zvi) Abraham Kantorowicz was moved to the ghetto from Lodz, Poland.",
      "After spending several years in the ghetto under hard labor conditions, including losing family members, they were shuffled through several labor camps, where they were able to continue meeting clandestinely for several months.",
      "\u201cMy mother said there was actually a lot of love in those places,\u201d Shalem recalled of the labor camps. \u201cThey used to walk along the river. There was romance.\u201d",
      "Her mother\u2019s friends used to help set up secret meetings between the two, who had married in an informal ceremony back in the ghetto.",
      "In 1944, the couple was separated. Hersz Kantorowicz would eventually perish in a death march just days before the war ended. Lola spent time in Auschwitz and the Hindenburg labor camp. She completed a death march to Bergen-Belsen in Germany while pregnant.",
      "\u201cIf they discovered she was pregnant, they would have killed her,\u201d Shalem said. \u201cShe hid her pregnancy from everyone, including her friends, because she didn\u2019t want the extra attention or anyone to give her their food.\"",

      "To this day, Shalem doesn\u2019t have an explanation for how her mother not only survived the conditions of the camp but gave birth to a healthy baby.

      "\u201cActually, I was everyone\u2019s child, because for them, it was some kind of sign of life,\u201d Shalem said. \u201cMany, many women took care of me there, because they were very excited to be with a little baby.\u201d",

      "She\u2019s not aware of any other children born in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp who survived. Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust museum and research center, has documented over 2,000 babies born at the Bergen-Belsen refugee camp after its liberation, between 1945 and 1950. The museum at Bergen-Belsen was able to locate documentation of Ilana\u2019s birth, including the hour she was born, which is now kept at Yad Vashem.",

      "She noted how, in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, many survivors of that attack immediately began to speak about what happened to them.",
      "But the aftermath of the Holocaust, especially in Israel, was different. Many survivors were trying to forget what had happened. Ilana\u2019s mother often faced disbelief when she shared her story of giving birth in a concentration camp, so she mostly stopped telling it. Sometimes her mother would talk about what she endured with other survivor friends, but rarely with strangers, Shalem said.",
      "Shalem has never publicly shared the story of her mother, who died in 1991 at the age of 71. Last year, she completed a genealogy course at Yad Vashem and began to understand how few Holocaust survivors are left to share their stories.",
      "According to the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, there are approximately 196,600 living Holocaust survivors, half of whom live in Israel. Nearly 25,000 Holocaust survivors died last year. The median age of Holocaust survivors is 87, meaning most were very young children during the Holocaust. Shalem is among the youngest.",
      "Shalem, who has two daughters, remembers sharing her own pregnancies with her mother, and marveling at what she had endured.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that was very unusual, it probably required special strength to be able to believe,\u201d Shalem said.",
      "\u201cShe said that one of the things was that if she had known my father was killed, she wouldn\u2019t have tried so hard. She wanted him to know me.\u201d",

      "When a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.",
      "Since then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.",
      "The flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.",

      "In the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.",
      "There also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.",
      "Despite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts \u2014 men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine \u2014 are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.",

      "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is heading to China, seeking a thaw in relations with Beijing at a time of strained ties with the United States.",
      "He's hoping for an economic boost to Britain, but risks the wrath of China hawks at home \u2013 and of U.S. President Donald Trump, who\u2019s already heaping tariffs and criticism on America\u2019s closest allies.",
      "Starmer is due to meet China\u2019s President Xi Jinping during the visit that starts Wednesday, the first by a U.K. leader since 2018. He is expected to be accompanied by U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle and dozens of corporate chiefs as Britain seeks Chinese technology and investment, alongside greater access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy for U.K. financial services, cars and Scotch whisky.",
      "\u201cChina is no longer just the world\u2019s factory; it is also becoming a global market,\u201d said Zhao Minghao, a professor in the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University.",

      "But he said \u201cStarmer is going to be talking to a very skeptical audience.",
      "\u201cBritain has not been very consistent in its relations with China. We have been very hot and cold,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The relationship has soured since the short-lived \u201cgolden era\u201d proclaimed in 2015 by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, who took Xi to a traditional English pub during a state visit. Beijing\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and growing concern about espionage and economic interference have widened the gap between London and Beijing.",
      "Cameron\u2019s Conservative successors barred Chinese investment in sensitive telecoms infrastructure and squeezed China out of investment in new U.K. nuclear power plants.",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party government carried out a review of relations with Beijing after it was elected 18 months ago. It says its approach is one of hard-headed pragmatism \u2013 protecting national security from Chinese espionage and interference while keeping up diplomatic dialogue and economic cooperation with the Asian superpower.",
      "Both Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 the world\u2019s sixth largest \u2013 and Starmer\u2019s popularity could use a boost.",
      "His government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised and ease a cost-of-living crisis for millions of households. Labour lags behind hard-right Reform UK in opinion polls, and nervous Labour lawmakers openly mull whether it would be better to ditch Starmer for a more charismatic leader, such as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.",
      "Starmer\u2019s visit to China comes as cracks are starting to appear in his attempt to strike up a warm relationship with Trump \u2013 efforts rewarded with a trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on Britain\u2019s key auto and aerospace industries.",

      "Starmer travels to Beijing days after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Next month it\u2019s the turn of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as some of America\u2019s strongest allies hedge their bets against the unpredictable Trump.",
      "Zhao said growing unease among U.S. allies over Washington\u2019s recent policy moves, including on tariffs, Greenland and the war in Ukraine, \u201chave triggered a wave among allies to recalibrate their policies to \u2018de-risk\u2019 from the United States.\u201d",
      "But rapprochement with Beijing brings the risk of a rift with Washington. Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods after Carney struck a trade deal with China on his trip this month.",
      "Starmer\u2019s critics say the government is being naive about China\u2019s threat to Britain\u2019s security and weak in the face of pressure from Beijing.",
      "The trip follows U.K. approval of a 20,000 square-meter (around 215,000 square-foot) Chinese embassy near the Tower of London despite strong opposition from critics who say the \u201cmega-embassy\u201d will make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents.",
      "Starmer also faces criticism over an agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. The government says the move will secure the future of a key U.K.-U.S. military base against legal challenge, but critics argue it opens the door to Chinese influence. Last week Trump spoke out against the deal, reversing his previous support.",
      "Human rights are another tricky area. Chris Patten, who was governor of Hong Kong from 1992 until the British colony was handed back to China in 1997, said Starmer should be firm in raising disagreements over issues including the treatment of China\u2019s Uyghur minority and the imprisonment of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner and British citizen.",

      "Brown, from King's College, said Starmer will likely consider his trip a success if it secures significant investment and avoids major political pitfalls.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re going to do is basically commit to consistency, a bit more predictability,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends where we can be friends, otherwise agree to disagree.\u201d",

      "That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran\u2019s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout \u2014 the most comprehensive in its history.",

      "ROME -- The first refugee to lead the U.N. refugee agency said Monday the world faces \u201ca very difficult moment in history\u201d and is appealing to a common humanity amid dramatic change.",
      "Repression of immigrants is growing, and the funding to protect them is plummeting. Without ever mentioning the Trump administration or its policies directly, Barham Salih in an interview with The Associated Press said his office will have to be inventive to confront the crisis, which includes losing well over $1 billion in U.S. support.",
      "\u201cOf course it\u2019s a fight, undeniably so, but I think also I\u2019m hopeful and confident that there is enough humanity out there to really enable us to do that,\u201d said Salih, a former president of Iraq.",
      "He also was adamant on the need to safeguard the 1951 refugee convention as the Trump administration campaigns for other governments to join it in upending a decades-old system and redefining asylum rules.",
      "Salih, who took up his role as high commissioner for refugees on Jan. 1, described it as an international legal responsibility and a moral responsibility.",
      "According to his agency also known as UNHCR, there are 117.3 million forcibly displaced people around the world from 194 countries. Salih\u2019s challenge is supporting some 30 million refugees with significantly less funds.",
      "In 2024 and 2025, funding from the U.S. dropped from $2.1 billion to $800 million, and yet the country remains UNHCR\u2019s largest donor.",
      "\u201cResources made available to helping refugees are being constrained and limited in very, very significant way,\u201d Salih said.",
      "The Trump administration is also reviewing the U.S. asylum system, suspending the refugee program in 2025 and setting a limit for entries to 7,500, mostly white South Africans \u2014 a historic low for refugee admittance since the program\u2019s inception in 1980.",
      "The Trump administration also has tightened immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations while facing criticism for deportations to third countries and an uproar over two fatal shootings by federal officers and other deaths.",
      "\u201cWe have to accept the need for adapting with a new environment in the world,\u201d Salih said. His agency is seeking to be more cost-effective, \u201cto really deliver assistance to the people who need it, rather than be part of a system that sustains dependency on humanitarian assistance,\u201d he added.",

      "Asked whether he discussed the current events in Minneapolis, where residents and others are protesting an immigration enforcement crackdown, Salih said no.",

      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks' legacy continues to grow, even as the 20th anniversary of his death approaches",
      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks\u2019 legacy continues to expand today, even as the 20th anniversary of his death arrives on March 7. However, the Gordon Parks Foundation, which celebrates the same milestone this year, is finding it harder to fund its work inspired by the director of \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d and \u201cShaft.\u201d",
      "Though Gordon Parks Foundation Executive Director Peter W. Kunhardt, Jr., told The Associated Press that federal funding cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion programs have only had a limited direct impact on the foundation\u2019s work due to a \u201cstrong base of supporters,\u201d it isn\u2019t immune to the changing, more competitive funding landscape that many arts-focused nonprofits now face.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely sensitive to the fact the world has drastically changed and the arts and DEI and culture have definitely taken a hit,\u201d said Kunhardt.",
      "That puts extra emphasis on fundraising events like the foundation\u2019s gala -- its largest annual fundraising event \u2013 especially in a major anniversary year.",
      "The foundation said Tuesday it will honor EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) winner John Legend, Grammy winner Chance the Rapper, Mellon Foundation President Elizabeth Alexander, and artist Henry Taylor at its gala on May 19 in Manhattan. Advocate and philanthropist Lonnie Ali will also be honored at the event, accepting the award for her late husband Muhammad Ali, who was a longtime friend of Parks, and their entire family.",
      "\u201cWe need to preserve the past to inspire the future by honoring these individuals,\u201d Kunhardt said. \u201cThe particular people on this list for 20 years are very important because they represent many different disciplines that Gordon Parks focused in on and who have championed the arts and social justice.\u201d",
      "Parks was best known for his work at Life magazine, documenting race relations and American life for decades as the magazine\u2019s first Black staff photographer. He famously bought his first camera at a pawnshop and taught himself to use it at a mix of jobs in Minnesota.",
      "That work led to him receiving the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in 1942, which provided a one-year apprenticeship under Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration, alongside acclaimed photographers including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. Parks wanted to provide similar support for young artists and the Gordon Parks Foundation now awards numerous fellowships in art, music and writing. Last year, the foundation launched a Legacy Acquisition Fund, which purchases the work of older artists in order to support them and their connection to Parks.",
      "Those programs, along with the star-studded 2021 HBO documentary \u201cA Choice of Weapons: Inspired by Gordon Parks,\u201d have fueled a resurgence of interest in Parks and his work.",
      "\u201cPeople who have had such an extraordinarily long life and so much output of such a high caliber like Parks are bound to become players who become even more important,\u201d said Casey Riley, chair of the Department of Global Contemporary Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying attention to what he was doing, it will be relevant to the moment.\u201d",
      "Riley -- who curated the museum\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gothic: Gordon Parks and Ella Watson\u201d exhibit, which focused on the creation of one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential photographs -- said that Parks is a \u201ctouchstone\u201d for many artists of color, especially Black American artists. However, the Kansas-born Parks has a special bond with artists from Minneapolis and St. Paul, where he spent his formative years as a photographer.",

      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",

      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

      "Use these strategies to replace retirement uncertainty with a feeling of clarity and control over your financial plan",
      "The greatest financial danger in retirement isn\u2019t always the stock market. It\u2019s the constant, nagging fear of running out of money. This anxiety causes many people to underspend and worry, even when their finances are sound.",
      "Here are eight ways to replace that worry with lasting security.",
      "Worry often starts with the vague question, \u201cAm I spending too much?\u201d",
      "Instead of operating on gut feeling, work with an advisor to determine your personal sustainable withdrawal rate (often between 3% and 5%). Once you know your lifestyle is covered by a responsible withdrawal rate, you can stop guessing and start living confidently.",
      "Many retirees treat their spending plan like an all-or-nothing system. This rigidity creates panic during market downturns.",
      "Instead, adopt a dynamic spending strategy. Slightly reduce or delay discretionary spending in poor market years. By reducing your withdrawal rate by just 10% when your portfolio is down, you dramatically reduce the risk of permanent capital depletion, allowing the assets time to recover.",
      "The high level of discretionary spending you need at age 65 will likely not be the same at age 85, especially once you have long-term care coverage (see No. 7).",
      "Expenses for travel, hobbies, dining out, and maintaining multiple homes typically decrease as you age. Knowing that your major risk (long-term care) is insured, you can trust that your remaining costs will naturally ease over the next two decades. Your money is working harder when you\u2019re younger and enjoying it most, and your needs will taper off as your capital naturally draws down.",
      "The greatest tactical threat to longevity is experiencing a large market crash early in retirement and having to sell depressed assets to pay for basics such as groceries. To protect yourself,",
      "maintain a six- to 12-month cash cushion outside of the market.",
      "This \u201crecession buffer\u201d allows your growth assets (equities) to sit untouched and recover during a market downturn, preventing you from locking in losses. This separation between your living money and your long-term growth money is the most direct way to eliminate panic during volatility.",
      "Future, unknown tax rates and large required minimum distributions from traditional retirement accounts are a major source of financial uncertainty.",
      "What can you do? Eliminate the tax uncertainty by creating a tax-free bucket.",
      "By using targeted Roth conversions\u2014using up lower tax brackets to recharacterize traditional IRAs\u2014you ensure a significant portion of your savings is shielded from all future tax increases. Having a large tax-free account gives you maximum flexibility to control your taxable income every year, protecting you from future legislation and eliminating the anxiety of surprise tax bills.",
      "Retirement is worry-free when your core, non-negotiable needs (housing, food, utilities) are covered by income sources shielded from market volatility.",
      "Social Security is your primary source of inflation-adjusted, government-backed income. While claiming at full retirement age is a safe minimum, aiming to delay Social Security until age 70 maximizes your lifetime benefit.",

      "Long-term care is the single largest threat to a lifetime of savings. Getting a quality long-term care insurance policy protects your nest egg from being wiped out by nursing home or in-home care costs. Once that risk is contained, you no longer need to worry about a seven-figure expense appearing unexpectedly.",

      "After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week\u2019s meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won\u2019t like the result",
      "WASHINGTON -- After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week's meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won't like the result.",
      "The central bank's interest rate-setting committee is almost certain to keep its key short-term rate unchanged at about 3.6%, after three straight quarter-point cuts last year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after December's meeting that they were \u201cwell positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\u201d before making any further moves.",
      "When the Fed lowers its short-term rate, it can over time influence other borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, though those rates are also affected by market forces.",
      "This week's meeting \u2014 one of eight the Fed holds each year \u2014 will be overshadowed by the bombshell revelation earlier this month that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed as part of a criminal investigation into testimony Powell gave last June about a $2.5 billion building renovation. It's the first time a sitting Fed chair has been investigated, and prompted an unusually public rebuke from Powell.",
      "Now, Powell will have to shift from a dispute with the White House to emphasizing that the Fed's decisions around interest rates are driven by economic concerns, not politics. Powell said Jan. 11 that the subpoenas were \u201cpretexts\u201d to punish the Fed for not cutting rates as sharply as Trump wants.",
      "Powell will be \"under even more pressure to underscore, \u2018everything we\u2019re doing here ... is all about the economics,\u2019\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and chief economist at New Century Advisors. \"'We didn\u2019t think about the politics.'\u201d",
      "Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley and also a former Fed staffer, said that despite the scrutiny, the Fed can be expected to consider its interest rate policies like it always does.",
      "\u201cThe meetings have a regular flow to them,\u201d he said. \"There are presentations that are made, there are discussions that have to be had. ... Some of these other broader-based attacks on the Fed don't really come up.\"",
      "Not long after the Justice Department's subpoenas, the Supreme Court last week considered whether Trump can fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed's 112-year history. During an oral argument, the justices appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved.",

      "Other Fed officials have also signaled the central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged at their two-day meeting that ends Wednesday. The Fed's three rate cuts last year were intended to bolster the economy after hiring slowed sharply over the summer and fall in the wake of Trump's April tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Yet the unemployment rate ticked lower in December, after picking up for much of last year, and there are other signs the job market may be stabilizing. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits has stayed historically low, a sign layoffs haven't spiked.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation remains elevated and actually ticked higher last year, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Prices rose 2.8% in November from a year earlier, the latest data available. That is up from 2.6% in November 2024.",
      "Unless businesses start cutting jobs or the unemployment rate rises, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates again for at least a few months, economists say. If inflation slowly declines this year, as economists expect, the Fed may cut again in the spring or summer. Wall Street investors expect just two quarter-point rate reductions this year, according to futures prices.",
      "Many economists expect growth could pick up in the coming months, which would be another reason to forego rate cuts. Gapen estimates that tax refunds could be about 20% higher this spring than last year as the Trump administration's tax cuts take effect. Refunds could average $3,500, Gapen said.",
      "The economy expanded at a 4.4% annual rate in last year's July-September quarter and may have grown at a similarly healthy pace in the final three months of last year. If such solid growth continues, Fed officials will likely wait to see if hiring picks up as well, further reducing the need for more rate cuts.",

      "President Donald Trump strong-armed America\u2019s biggest trading partners into pledging trillions of dollars of investment in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has strong-armed many of America\u2019s biggest trading partners into pledging trillions of dollars of investment in the United States. But a study out Tuesday raises doubts about whether the money will actually materialize and questions how it would be spent if it did.",
      "\u201cHow realistic are these commitments?\u2019\u2019 write Gregory Auclair and Adnan Mazarei of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank that supports free trade. \u201cThe short answer is that they are clouded with uncertainty.\u2019\u2019",
      "They looked at more than $5 trillion in investment commitments made last year by the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the Persian Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Trump used the threat of punitive tariffs \u2013 import taxes \u2013 to pry concessions out of those trading partners, including the investment pledges.",
      "The White House has published an even higher investment figure - $9.6 trillion \u2013 that includes public and private investment commitments from other countries. Trump himself, never one to undersell his achievements, has put the number far higher -- $17 billion or $18 billion -- though Auclair and Mazarei note that \u201cthe basis for his claim is not clear.\u2019\u2019",
      "All the numbers are huge. Total private investment in the United States was most recently running at a $5.4 trillion annual pace. In 2024, the last year for which figures are available, total foreign direct investment in the United States amounted to $151 billion. Direct investment includes money sunk into such things as factories and offices but not financial investments like stocks and bonds.",
      "\u201cThe pledged amounts are large,\u2019\u2019 Auclair and Mazarei write, \u201cbut their time horizon varies, and the metrics for measuring and thus verifying the pledges are generally unclear.\u2019\u2019 They note, for example, that the European Union\u2019s pledge to invest $600 billion in the United States \u201ccarries no legally binding commitment.\u2019\u2019",
      "The report also finds that some countries would strain to meet their pledges. For the Gulf countries, \u201cthe commitments are large relative to their financial resources,\u201d the researchers write.",
      "\u201cSaudi Arabia appears capable of meeting its targets, with some difficulty.\u2019\u2019 The United Arab Emirates and Qatar would find it even harder and might have to finance the investments by borrowing. \u201cIn all three cases, the commitments are nonbinding, and investments from these countries could fall well below headline numbers,\u2019\u2019 they write.",
      "Moreover, \u201cthese agreements have been reached under duress,\u2019\u2019 Mazarei, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily being done willingly.\u2019\u2019",
      "So trading partners could look for ways to escape their commitments \u2013 especially if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs Trump used to negotiate the one-sided agreements. A ruling is expected as early as February. \u201cOther countries may find a way to wiggle out,\u2019\u2019 Mazarei said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is increasing tariffs on South Korean goods because the country\u2019s legislature has yet to approve the trade framework announced last year.",
      "Trump said on social media that import taxes would be raised on autos, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs from South Korea with the rate on other goods going from 15% to 25%. The U.S. president previously imposed the tariffs by declaring an economic emergency and bypassing Congress, while South Korea needed legislative approval for the framework announced in July and affirmed during Trump's October visit to the country.",
      "\u201cOur Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same.\u201d",
      "The threat was a reminder that the tariff drama unleashed last year by Trump is likely to be repeated again and again this year. The global economy and U.S. voters might find the world's trade structure constantly being subject to disruption and new negotiations as Trump has already sought to levy tariffs in order to bend other nations to his will.",
      "Trump has in the past tied his tariffs to commitments by South Korea to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy over several years, including efforts to revitalize American shipyards. But the Trump administration's relations with South Korea have at times been rocky with the raid last year by immigration officials at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia in which 475 people were detained.",

      "Experts say the massive winter storm hitting the American East is taking a multi-billion dollar toll on the U.S. economy",
      "HOUSTON -- The deadly and widespread winter storm paralyzing much of the American East with ice, snow and cold is also taking a multi-billion dollar bite out of the U.S. economy, experts figure.",
      "But how much? Economists and meteorologists are trying to get a handle on the disruption costs of winter weather disasters, which aren\u2019t as easy to calculate as buildings destroyed by hurricanes, floods and fires.",
      "\u201cEvents like this storm highlight just how interconnected our economy is with weather conditions. When major transportation hubs shut down or power grids fail, the cascading effects ripple through supply chains and business operations across multiple sectors simultaneously,\u201d said Jacob Fooks, a research economist for Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University.",
      "Fooks said researchers don't have consensus, but most estimates suggest severe weather events collectively can cut gross domestic product by 0.5% to 2% annually \u2014 which he called \u201cvery substantial.\u201d",
      "With U.S. GDP at about $30 trillion annually, that would be from $150 billion to $600 billion.",
      "Most economists, meteorologists and disaster experts said it's too early to put a legitimate cost estimate on the weekend storm and upcoming week of subfreezing temperatures. But the private company AccuWeather announced that its preliminary estimate for the storm that grounded 11,400 flights is between $105 billion and $115 billion \u2014 an amount six other experts scoffed at as far too high and insufficiently detailed.",
      "\"A lot of it comes from the disruptions that occur to commerce, the cost of power outages,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter told The Associated Press at the annual American Meteorological Society convention in a chilly Houston. \"Some businesses are going to be shut down for days or a week or more.\"",
      "It's why AccuWeather is calling this \u201cthe storm that shut it all down,\u201d Porter said. By Monday, it had killed at least 25 people.",
      "Add to that ice toppling electrical lines leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power, tree losses, damage to cars, and all those canceled flights, Porter said. He noted it will take time to reboot air travel and restore power.",
      "Climate economist Adam Smith, who used to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's billion-dollar weather disaster list, said this storm will easily cost multiple billions of dollars, making it the country's first billion-dollar weather disaster of 2026.",
      "But Smith, now a senior climate impact scientist at Climate Central, said it's nowhere near as costly as AccuWeather suggests. He said the private company has been an outlier among experts in climate impacts and economics. He pointed to the private company's initial estimate of $250 billion in damage from last year's Los Angeles wildfires. Several climate, risk and insurance groups all waited to do extensive analysis and all said the real amount was around $60 billion.",
      "AccuWeather\u2019s estimates are much higher because they take into account the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of indirect and long-term costs, Porter said, including the business supply chain as well as medical costs. Most other estimates are \u201cunder-describing the challenges that people in the community and business face,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to NOAA's billion-dollar disaster page which listed factors not considered. That page says NOAA's estimates \u201cshould be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost.\u201d",

      "Smith said this weekend's storm could approach the cost of the 2021 Texas storm because it is so widespread.",
      "There's a big difference in the type of losses that are talked about with winter storms and other weather disasters.",
      "Hurricanes, fires and floods cause damage to buildings, infrastructure and physical things that insurers will pay out for. In snow and ice storms, much of it is lost opportunity, which is more amorphous and harder to quantify, said Smith, Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini, former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue and former National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the billion dollar damage, we talk about hurricane damage, we\u2019re basically talking about insurable losses,\u201d Maue said. \u201cPeople generally aren\u2019t renumerated for bad weather.\u2019\u2019",
      "Uccellini noted it can be tricky to figure out costs of those lost opportunities, in part, because research has found there can be economic winners in winter storms \u2014 for example, the hardware store that sells more shovels and salt, and the grocery store that sells more food.",
      "Fooks, of Colorado State, said it still seems that losses far outstrip those gains. He cited things like disruption of supply chains and business operations, response costs for emergency managers and departments of transportation, and so on.",

      "The Dallas-based airline\u2019s unusual seating process began as a way to get passengers on planes quickly and thereby reduce the time that aircraft and crews spent on the ground not making money. It helped Southwest operate more efficiently and to squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule; the system also was a key reason Southwest remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The open-seating arrangement became less democratic over time, however, as Southwest also had starting allowing passengers to pay extra for spots near the front of the line.",
      "An eight\u2011group boarding structure is replacing the find-your-own-seat scrum. Instead of numbered metal columns at departure gates, passengers will file through two alternating lanes once it's time for their group to board.",
      "The airline said its gate areas will be converted in phases starting Monday night, a process that could take about two months to complete. Columns that remain standing past Tuesday will have their numbers removed or covered in the meantime.",
      "Southwest is selling tickets at fares with different seating choices, including standard seats assigned at check\u2011in or paid preferred and extra\u2011legroom seats selected at booking. For certain flights, passengers also will have the option of paying for priority boarding beginning 24 hours before departure.",

      "Businesses are coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, whether it\u2019s public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for arrests themselves",
      "From family-run cafes to retail giants, businesses are increasingly coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, whether it's public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for such arrests themselves.",
      "In Minneapolis, where the Department of Homeland Security says it\u2019s carrying out its largest operation ever, hotels, restaurants and other businesses have temporarily closed their doors or stopped accepting reservations amid widespread protests.",
      "On Sunday, after the U.S. Border Patrol shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy and UnitedHealth signed an open letter calling for \"an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.\u201d",
      "Still, that letter didn\u2019t name immigration enforcement directly, or point to recent arrests at businesses. Earlier this month, widely-circulated videos showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in Minnesota. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has rounded up day laborers in Home Depot parking lots and delivery workers on the street nationwide. And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.",
      "Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.",
      "Anyone \u2014 including ICE \u2014 can enter public areas of a business as they wish. This can include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles.",
      "\u201cThe general public can go into a store for purposes of shopping, right? And so can law enforcement agents \u2014 without a warrant,\u201d said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit. As a result, immigration officials may try to question people, seize information and even make arrests in public-facing parts of a business.",
      "But to enter areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy \u2014 like a back office or a closed-off kitchen \u2014 ICE is supposed to have a judicial warrant, which must be signed by a judge from a specified court, and can be limited to certain days or parts of the business.",
      "Judicial warrants should not be confused with administrative warrants, which are signed by immigration officers.",
      "But in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, ICE leadership stated administrative warrants were sufficient for federal officers to forcibly enter people's homes if there\u2019s a final order of removal. Hahn and other immigration rights lawyers say this upends years of precedent for federal agents\u2019 authority in private spaces \u2014 and violates \u201cbedrock principles\u201d of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "Still, the easiest way for ICE to enter private spaces in businesses without a warrant is through consent from an employer, which could be as simple as letting an agent into certain parts of the property. The agency may also cite other \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d Hahn notes, such as if they\u2019re in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a certain individual.",
      "Beyond more sweeping workplace raids, enforcement against employers can also take the form of I-9 audits, which focus on verifying employees' authorization to work in the U.S.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term, attorneys have pointed to an uptick in instances of ICE physically showing up to a place of business to initiate an I-9 audit. ICE has the authority to do this \u2014 but it marks a shift from prior enforcement, when audits more often began through writing like mailed notices.",
      "David Jones, a regional managing partner at labor and employment law firm Fisher Phillips in Memphis, said he's also seen immigration agents approach these audits with the same approach as recent raids.",

      "So many things went wrong last Jan. 29 to contribute to the deadliest plane crash on American soil since 2001 that the National Transportation Safety Board isn't likely to identify a single cause of the collision between an airliner and an Army helicopter near Washington that killed 67 people at its hearing Tuesday.",
      "Instead, their investigators will detail what they found that played a role in the crash, and the board will recommend changes to help prevent a similar tragedy. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration already took the temporary restrictions it imposed after the crash and made them permanent to ensure planes and helicopters won't share the same airspace again around Reagan National Airport.",
      "Family members of victims hope those suggestions won't be ignored the same way many past NTSB recommendations have been. Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the first officer on the American Airlines plane, said he hopes officials in Congress and the administration will make changes now instead of waiting until for another disaster.",
      "\u201cInstead of writing aviation regulation in blood, let\u2019s start writing it in data,\u201d said Lilley, who is a pilot himself and earlier in his career flew Black Hawk helicopters in the Washington area. \u201cBecause all the data was there to show this accident was going to happen. This accident was completely preventable.\"",
      "Over the past year, the NTSB has already highlighted a number of the factors that contributed to the crash including a poorly designed helicopter route past Reagan Airport, the fact that the Black Hawk was flying 78 feet (23.7 meters) higher than it should have been, the warnings that the FAA ignored in the years beforehand and the Army's move to turn off a key system that would have broadcast the helicopter\u2019s location more clearly.",
      "The D.C. plane crash was the first in a number of high-profile crashes and close calls throughout 2025 that alarmed the public, but the total number of crashes last year was actually the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 with 1,405 crashes nationwide.",
      "Experts say flying remains the safest way to travel because of all the overlapping layers of precautions built into the system, but too many of those safety measures failed at the same time last Jan. 29.",
      "Here is some of what we have learned about the crash:",
      "The route along the Potomac River the Black Hawk was following that night allowed for helicopters and planes to come within 75 feet (23 meters) of each other when a plane was landing on the airport's secondary runway that typically handles less than 5% of the flights landing at Reagan. And that distance was only ensured when the helicopter stuck to flying along the bank of the river, but the official route didn't require that.",
      "Normally, air traffic controllers work to keep aircraft at least 500 feet (152 meters) apart to keep them safe, so the scant separation on Route 4 posed what NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called \u201can intolerable risk to flight safety.\u201d",
      "The controllers at Reagan also had been in the habit of asking pilots to watch out for other aircraft themselves and maintain visual separation as they tried to squeeze in more planes to land on what the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority has called the busiest runway in the country.

      "Kawhi Leonard has been leading the NBA in scoring since December 20th, averaging 31.8 points per game",
      "The date was Dec. 20. It was the day everything changed for the Los Angeles Clippers.",
      "Kawhi Leonard has been the leading scorer in the NBA since, averaging 31.8 points per game. James Harden has averaged 25.1 points in that stretch. The Clippers have the best scoring differential in the Western Conference over that span. They've been rolling.",
      "This is where Robert Flom enters the story.",
      "Flom is a blogger who covers the Clippers, and Dec. 20 was when he wrote the following on X: \"If they go 15-3 in any stretch this season will print and eat this tweet.\u201d",
      "The Clippers have gone 15-3 since. True to his word, Flom printed the tweet Monday and ate it.",
      "\u201cPretty crunchy,\u201d he said.",
      "Social media wasn't around in 1953 or 1985, which means it's highly unlikely anyone in Baltimore or Cleveland had to endure a crunchy moment like the one Flom put himself through on Monday night.",
      "The 1952-53 Baltimore Bullets got into the playoffs by finishing fourth in a five-team division, in a year when eight of the NBA's 10 teams made the postseason. The 1984-85 Cleveland Cavaliers got into the playoffs despite spending more than three months of that season holding down last place in the Eastern Conference.",
      "Both teams started those seasons with 6-21 records. Of the 121 teams that started an NBA season with a record that bad or worse, including five this season, those Bullets (who finished 16-54) and Cavaliers (who finished 36-46) are the only two that wound up reaching the postseason.",
      "The Clippers started 6-21 this season. The playoffs were a million miles away. Not anymore.",
      "Going into Tuesday's game at Utah, the Clippers are three games under .500 at 21-24. They are only 10th in the West, but that would be enough to get them into the play-in tournament and give them a chance at a playoff berth.",
      "For a team that was a half-game out of last place in the West a couple of days before Christmas, just getting back to play-in range this soon represents a minor miracle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident, we\u2019re playing well, but we've still got to play better,\u201d Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after Sunday's 126-89 romp over the Brooklyn Nets. \"We still have to run through the tape and continue to execute the right way. ... Overall, we\u2019re playing well. We\u2019ve got to keep it going.\u201d",

      "Clippers fans got into the act as well, chanting \u201ceat the tweet\u201d during Sunday's game. It's a feel-good story, such as it is. And there have been a few of those in the NBA this season.",
      "Among them: Toronto started slowly but is vying for home-court advantage in Round 1 of the playoffs now. BetMGM Sportsbook had Phoenix's over-under for wins this season at 30.5; the Suns have already won 27 games. The Celtics, even without Jayson Tatum, are No. 2 in the East, something few outside Boston probably expected.",
      "The Clippers were supposed to be good, like title-contending good. Starting 6-21 was beyond unexpected. Then again, so was the turnaround. And the tweet is a neat part of why everyone seems happy in Clipperland these days, after tons of drama going back to the summer.",
      "There was a probe of whether a business relationship between Leonard and a California company was legitimate or merely a way for the Clippers to circumvent salary cap rules, then Chris Paul being sent home in a stunning early December move, and a whole lot of losing.",

    "story": [
      "A new humanoid robot named Sprout, developed by Fauna Robotics, is making its debut",
      "NEW YORK -- As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like \u201ceyebrows\u201d and offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.",
      "Sprout's charm is the point. A 5-year-old child could comfortably talk at eye level with this humanoid, which stands 3.5 feet (1 meter) tall and wears a soft, padded exterior of sage-green foam.",
      "Forged by stealth startup Fauna Robotics over two years of secret research and development, Sprout's public debut on Tuesday aims to jump-start a whole new industry of building \u201capproachable\u201d robots for homes, schools and social spaces.",
      "The robot is in many ways the first of its kind, at least in the United States, even as rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robot engineering have finally made it possible to start building such machines. If its emotive expressions and blinking lights seem vaguely familiar, it might be from generations of Star Wars droids and other endearingly clunky robotic sidekicks dreamed up in animation studios and children's literature.",
      "\u201cMost people in this industry take inspiration from the science fiction that we grew up with,\u201d said Fauna Robotics co-founder and CEO Rob Cochran. \u201cI think some do so from \u2018Westworld\u2019 and \u2018Terminator.\u2019 We do from WALL-E and Baymax and Rosie Jetson.\u201d",
      "The usual hypothesis for the commercialization of humanoid robots is that they will get their first jobs in warehouses or factories long before they are ready for homes. That's the path proposed for two of today's best-known prototypes: Tesla's Optimus, which CEO Elon Musk sees as the carmaker's future, and Boston Dynamics' Atlas, which parent company Hyundai plans to deploy in car manufacturing by 2028.",
      "Fauna looks to skip that step for an entirely different clientele: other robot tinkerers. Much as early personal computers and, later, smartphones sparked a culture of developers designing new games and applications, Sprout is a software developer platform more than just a robot. It's also a mechanically complex one that will cost buyers $50,000.",
      "That's a price some university research labs and technology entrepreneurs are already spending on China's Unitree, which sells a lightweight humanoid often seen at robotics conferences and competitions. Others have avoided Chinese hardware due to tariffs and broader security concerns.",
      "Cochran believes Fauna is \u201cthe first American company to be actively shipping robots as a developer platform\u201d and has been hand-delivering the first models. Early customers include Disney and Boston Dynamics.",
      "\u201cYou take it out of the box and you can start walking it around immediately,\u201d said Marc Theermann, chief strategy officer at Boston Dynamics, in a recent interview. \u201cSeeing their robot for the first time really lets you see the future a little bit. And if you squint, you can see how a robot like that would be welcomed into people\u2019s homes.\u201d",
      "Sprout can\u2019t lift heavy objects, but it can dance the Twist or the Floss, grab a toy block or teddy bear, or hoist itself from a chair to take a long stroll along the wood floors of Fauna\u2019s headquarters in New York City's Flatiron District.",
      "Cochran and co-founder Josh Merel, the company's chief technology officer, demonstrated the robot to The Associated Press in mid-January ahead of its public launch. Fauna employees and an AP reporter piloted the robot, using a video game controller, a phone application and a virtual-reality headset. Sprout also knows the office layout enough to be sent on a planned mission, such as to check out the inventory of the break room refrigerator.",
      "It walks slowly but steadily on uneven ground. Only once it came close to tripping, taking a sharp turn to avoid a person and instead hitting its foot on a protruding table wheel too low to the ground to be seen by Sprout's camera eyes. But the robot, built to handle what engineers call perturbation, quickly recovered its balance and kept walking, much like a clumsy person might.",

Among the first batch of Fauna's 50 employees, and a fan of science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, she previously worked on self-driving cars but was excited about joining a startup building something that might one day serve as a robot butler.",

      "\u201cThere were a lot of really brilliant attempts. I think the technology wasn\u2019t quite there,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re right on the precipice now where you could build a companion that is present, engaging, delightful to be around, and can also move around a space in a way that nothing ever has before.\u201d",
      "Merel, an expert in robot locomotion, previously worked for Google\u2019s DeepMind, where he focused on teaching robots using AI learning techniques in simulated environments, a controversial approach but now increasingly how robots are built. The science journal Nature published his study on an AI-powered virtual rat, co-authored with another of Fauna's research scientists, Diego Aldarondo.",
      "Cochran and Merel later worked together at CTRL-labs, a wearable neurotech company sold to Facebook in 2019. Cochran jokes that he then \u201cspent a misguided four years at Goldman Sachs\u201d before they decided to team up again.",
      "Improvements in AI, motors and batteries have accelerated humanoid development. But Fauna's founders agreed that the dystopian aesthetic of many prototypes \u2014 what Cochran calls \u201cindustrial automotive machismo\u201d \u2014 conveyed strength and confidence but wouldn't work for intimate human spaces.",
      "\u201cThey were generally quite big and physically dangerous to be around,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cStrong, heavy. If they fell on you, it\u2019d be a real problem.\u201d",
      "The duo brought in Anthony Moschella, who helped design Peloton's exercise bikes, treadmills and rowers and is an admirer of the abstract designs of Star Wars robots like R2-D2 and BB-8.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s build a system that human beings actually want to be around,\u201d said Moschella, now Fauna's vice president of hardware. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredible that so many robotics companies are not versed in the cultural context of what it means to be around a robot.\u201d",
      "Moschella said what happens next with Sprout will depend on how developers play around with it and what they learn. For Cochran, some of the most important judges have already approved. In a home video he keeps on his phone, his 2-year-old twins excitedly jump up and down as Sprout greets them.",

      "French lawmakers have approved a bill banning social media for children under 15",
      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",
      "The French government had previously passed a law banning phone use in all primary and middle schools.",
      "The vote in the assembly came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",

In November, European lawmakers called for action at EU level to protect minors online, including a bloc-wide minimum age of 16 and bans on the most harmful practices.",
      "According to France\u2019s health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "The French ban won\u2019t cover online encyclopedias, educational or scientific directories, or platforms for the development and sharing of open-source software.",
      "In Australia, social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",

      "Three of the world's biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims that their platforms \u2014 Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube \u2014 deliberately addict and harm children.",
      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

      "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping",
      "ATLANTA -- Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it?",
      "Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.",
      "The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.",
      "Here's a look at the technology \u2014 and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.",
      "Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.",
      "The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you\u2019re having versus REM sleep, that\u2019s where the in-lab studies really excel,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night.",
      "Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.",
      "\u201cWe would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep \u2014 and that is what the wearables do not do,\u201d she said.",
      "Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on \u201csleep hygiene\u201d such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable.",
      "Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.",
      "\u201cSeeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you\u2019re giving yourself the right amount of time, if you\u2019re sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won\u2019t be as efficient,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: \u201cIt\u2019s so accurate,\u201d she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.",

      "Mai Barreneche, who works in advertising in New York City, used to wear her Oura Ring constantly. She said it helped her develop good sleep habits and encouraged her to maintain a daily morning exercise regimen. But as a metric-driven person, she became \"obsessed\" enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety \u2014 a modern condition that researchers have dubbed \u201corthosomnia.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember I would go to bed thinking about the score I was going to get in the morning,\u201d Barreneche said.",
      "Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. She said she has maintained the good habits the device pointed her toward, but no longer wants the stress of monitoring her nightly scores.",
      "Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.",
      "\u201cThese devices are supposed to help you,\" Branson said. \"And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it\u2019s not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.\u201d",
      "Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.",
      "\u201cThe body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we\u2019re not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.\u201d",
      "The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this really important story that\u2019s about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,\u201d he said.",

      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "For some people, animal safety is a strong reason to look to a nonsalt option against ice and snow.",

      "Sand that runs off into freshwater bodies \u2014 lakes, streams and rivers \u2014 can kill natural growth, Tirado said.",
      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can\u2019t wait ... you need to go out multiple times. That way it keeps the paved surface more clear in a productive and proactive manner.\u201d",

      "Proper application of whatever you put on your sidewalk or driveway is important, too.",
      "\u201cThe key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,\" said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. \u201cWe also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.\"",

      "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent.

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has canceled solar projects in Puerto Rico worth millions of dollars, as the island struggles with chronic power outages and a crumbling electric grid.",
      "The projects were aimed at helping 30,000 low-income families in rural areas across the U.S. territory as part of a now-fading transition toward renewable energy.",
      "In an email obtained by The Associated Press, the U.S. Energy Department said that a push under Puerto Rico\u2019s former governor for a 100% renewable future threatened the reliability of its energy system.",
      "\u201cThe Puerto Rico grid cannot afford to run on more distributed solar power,\u201d the message states. \u201cThe rapid, widespread deployment of rooftop solar has created fluctuations in Puerto Rico\u2019s grid, leading to unacceptable instability and fragility.\u201d",
      "Javier R\u00faa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico\u2019s Solar and Energy Storage Association, disputed that statement in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "He said that some 200,000 families across Puerto Rico rely on solar power that generates close to 1.4 gigawatts of energy a day for the rest of the island.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s helping avoid blackouts,\u201d he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.",
      "He said he was saddened by the cancellation of the solar projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are funds for the most needy.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.",
      "In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.",
      "One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.",
      "\u201cThe people are really upset and angry,\u201d said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they\u2019re not sure why they\u2019re not included.\u201d",

      "Greenland's strategic location makes it a focal point if there were to be a nuclear conflict involving Russia, China and the United States",
      "PARIS -- In a hypothetical nuclear war involving Russia, China and the United States, the island of Greenland would be in the middle of Armageddon.",
      "The strategic importance of the Arctic territory \u2014 under the flight paths that nuclear-armed missiles from China and Russia could take on their way to incinerating targets in the United States, and vice versa \u2014 is one of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has cited in his disruptive campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, alarming Greenlanders and longtime allies in Europe alike.",
      "Trump has argued that U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for his \u201cGolden Dome\u201d \u2014 a multibillion dollar missile defense system that he says will be operational before his term ends in 2029.",
      "\u201cBecause of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday.",
      "That ushered in another roller-coaster week involving the semiautonomous Danish territory, where Trump again pushed for U.S. ownership before seemingly backing off, announcing Wednesday the \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d on Arctic security that's unlikely to be the final word.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Greenland's position at a crossroads for nuclear defense.",
      "Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, that nuclear adversaries would fire at each other \u2014 if it ever came to that \u2014 tend to take the shortest direct route, on a ballistic trajectory into space and down again, from their silos or launchers to targets. The shortest flight paths from China or Russia to the United States \u2014 and the other way \u2014 would take many of them over the Arctic region.",
      "Russian Topol-M missiles fired, for example, from the Tatishchevo silo complex southeast of Moscow would fly high over Greenland, if targeted at the U.S. ICBM force of 400 Minuteman III missiles, housed at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming.",
      "Chinese Dong Feng-31 missiles, if fired from new silo fields that the U.S. Defense Department says have been built in China, also could overfly Greenland should they be targeted at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.",
      "\u201cIf there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "An array of farseeing early warning radars act as the Pentagon's eyes against any missile attack. The northernmost of them is in Greenland, at the Pituffik Space Base. Pronounced \u201cbee-doo-FEEK,\u201d it used to be called Thule Air Base, but was renamed in 2023 using the remote location's Greenlandic name, recognizing the Indigenous community that was forcibly displaced by the U.S. outpost's construction in 1951.",
      "Its location above the Arctic Circle, and roughly halfway between Washington and Moscow, enables it to peer with its radar over the Arctic region, into Russia and at potential flight paths of U.S.-targeted Chinese missiles.",
      "\u201cThat gives the United States more time to think about what to do,\u201d said Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based analyst who specializes in Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cGreenland is a good location for that.\u201d",
      "The two-sided, solid-state AN/FPS-132 radar is designed to quickly detect and track ballistic missile launches, including from submarines, to help inform the U.S. commander in chief's response and provide data for interceptors to try and destroy warheads.",

      "\u201cTrump\u2019s argument that Greenland is vital for the Golden Dome \u2014 and therefore that it has to be invaded, well, acquired \u2014 is false for several reasons,\" Marcuz said.",
      "\u201cOne of them is that there is, for example, a radar in the United Kingdom, and to my knowledge there is no question of invading the U.K. And, above all, there are new sensors that are already being tested, in the process of being deployed, which will in fact reduce Greenland\u2019s importance.\u201d",
      "Because of its location, Greenland could be a useful place to station \u201cGolden Dome\u201d interceptors to try to destroy warheads before they reach the continental U.S.",

      "But the U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement. Before Trump ratcheted up the heat on the territory and Denmark, its owner, their governments likely would have readily accepted any American military request for an expanded footprint there, experts say. It used to have multiple bases and installations, but later abandoned them, leaving just Pituffik.",
      "\u201cDenmark was the most compliant ally of the United States,\u201d Marcuz said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s very different. I don\u2019t know whether authorization would be granted, but in any case, before, the answer was \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bill Cassidy didn't simply criticize the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.",
      "Following the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer, the Louisiana Republican warned of broader implications for the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,\u201d Cassidy wrote in a social media post, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThere must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.\u201d",
      "Trust is one of a president's most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, President Donald Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.",
      "Now the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies. Administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis and contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.",
      "In the hours after Pretti's killing, top Trump officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem were quick to cast Pretti as an instigator who \u201capproached\u201d officers with a gun and acted violently. But videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer before a half-dozen agents descend on him.",
      "During the scuffle, he held a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry. The administration has said investigations are ongoing, though information hasn't yet emerged to support some of the provocative initial claims.",

      "The White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration\u2019s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, sought to distance Trump from some of the initial claims about Pretti \u2014 including allegations that he was a domestic terrorist \u2014 noting they didn't come from the president himself.",
      "Still, lawmakers from both parties \u2014 including many Republicans \u2014 called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust.",

      "\u201cI disagree with Secretary Noem\u2019s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trump and his team have spent much of his second term studiously feeding content to social media platforms to engage their most loyal supporters in ways that independent fact checkers have found to be distorted or baseless.

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit seeking Oregon's unredacted voter rolls on Monday in another setback to wide-ranging efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to get detailed voter data from states.",
      "In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon's move to dismiss the case was granted.",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.",
      "\u201cThe court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \"Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can\u2019t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.",
      "In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three \u201csimple steps\u201d to \u201chelp bring back law and order\" \u2014 including by giving the Justice Department the ability to \u201caccess voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.\u201d",
      "Bondi also asked for the state's records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver\u2019s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.

Yet Kasubhai said the department's August letter did not satisfy the law's requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was \u201cunequivocal\u201d on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.",

      "But state officials are not alone in having concern over a departure from decades of standard practice, which has been the Department of Justice and its Civil Rights Division investigating the constitutionality of an officer's use of force, especially when fatal.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump shifted toward a more conciliatory approach with Democratic leaders in Minnesota on Monday, a sudden change in tack following an outcry over the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the state this month during the administration's nationwide crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "The about-face comes after Saturday\u2019s shooting death of Alex Pretti by federal agents raised doubts \u2014 including from some Republicans \u2014 over how the Trump administration has gone about aggressively deporting migrants and confronting protesters opposed to the policy.",

      "Earlier this month, Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force to squelch recent antigovernment protests. Human rights groups said thousands were killed, but Trump says he\u2019s holding off on acting after he received assurances Tehran was suspending hundreds of planned executions.",
      "Last week, Trump first announced plans to impose new tariffs on European allies that refused to go along with his calls for the U.S. to take control of the Arctic territory of Greenland \u2014 only to abruptly cancel the tariffs after saying he\u2019d come to terms of the \u201cframework\u201d of an agreement. The White House offered scant details about the deal, which Trump announced the day after the stock market saw one of its worst days in months in response to his tariff threat.",
      "Then on Monday, Trump's administration changed up oversight of his immigration operation in Minnesota, and the typically bombastic Trump offered a warmer tone toward Gov. Tim Walz after speaking with the Democrat, saying he and Walz were now on a \u201csimilar wavelength.\u201d",
      "It was a particularly jarring turnabout for Trump, who had promised to be uncompromising on carrying out mass deportations of undocumented migrants during his 2024 campaign \u2014 and because Trump has repeatedly scorched Walz and other Minnesota Democrats in personal terms for resisting his policies.",
      "Trump said he had dispatched border czar Tom Homan to take charge. Meanwhile, senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and some agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Trump declared on social media that Walz \u201cwas happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!\u201d Later, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirmed that some agents would be leaving the city after he spoke with Trump \u2014 and suggested that the president seemed to be coming to the conclusion that the current state of federal operations was unsustainable. Homan and Frey were expected to meet Tuesday.",
      "Trump's change-up in Minnesota came after some Republicans questioned federal agents' tactics in Saturday's shooting as well as the White House's response. Some high-ranking administration officials had branded Pretti a domestic terrorist even as videos of the encounter contradicted their narrative.",

      "Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration, offered measured criticism in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Davis, saying the White House needs to \u201crecalibrate\u201d what it was doing in Minnesota. Vermont's Republican Gov. Phil Scott called on Trump to reset and de-escalate.",
      "\u201cAt best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices training, and leadership,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAt worst, it\u2019s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that\u2019s resulting in the murder of Americans.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A group of lawyers and family members of important cartel figures accused Mexico's government on Tuesday of breaking the law by sending nearly a hundred Mexican citizens to the United States without an extradition order.",
      "It comes less than a week after the administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent 37 detained cartel members to the U.S. in what observers have described as an offering by Mexican authorities to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take military action against cartels.",
      "Since last February, Mexico has sent a total of 92 cartel members in three separate transfers to the U.S. requested by the Trump administration. It's part of a larger strategy by Sheinbaum to crack down on cartels and maintain a positive relationship with the Trump.",
      "The transfers have been at the center of a legal debate that has only gained more traction after last week's hand over. Mexico\u2019s government has maintained the transfers were legal, carried out in the name of national security. The Trump administration said the capos were wanted for crimes in the U.S. and many of them had outstanding extradition requests by the U.S.",
      "In a press conference on Tuesday, lawyers for the cartel members asserted they were denied due process because they were sent to the U.S. without an extradition order, which requires a lengthy legal process in Mexico.",
      "\u201cMexico is currently under intense pressure from the United States,\u201d said Yarey S\u00e1nchez Lagunas, the lawyer of two people transferred to the U.S. in the last year. \u201cThis forces us to seriously question if these decisions are being used to show political results, even if it comes at the expense of due process or the rule of law.\u201d",
      "The arguments echo those made by the lawyers of infamous capo Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, now serving a life sentence in a maximum-security prison in Colorado.",
      "S\u00e1nchez Lagunas is the defense lawyer of Itiel Palacios Garc\u00eda, a leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel sent to the U.S. last February, and Pablo Edwin Huerta Nu\u00f1o, a leader of the Arellano F\u00e9lix Cartel in northern Mexico sent in August.",

Her partner, Juan Pedro Sald\u00edvar Far\u00edas, was sent to the U.S. last week in the latest set of transfers and is accused of arms and drug trafficking.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n accused Harfuch and other security officials of \u201ctreason\u201d in her complaint filed to Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office on Tuesday, though lawyers of the transferred cartel members said they had no legal recourse within Mexico to challenge the transfers now that their clients are outside the country.",
      "\u201cThe transfer of my partner is nothing less than exile,\" she said. \u201cAs of today, we haven't heard anything from him. He hasn\u2019t even made his legally permitted call.\u201d",
      "Some, like Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, brushed off the complaints on Tuesday, and commended the U.S. authorities for \u201cfast-tracking\u201d a legal process that is often stalled for years by lawyers filing rounds of injunctions in an effort to slow down law enforcement.",
      "Vigil noted that Mexico's constitution allows the country's president to make major moves like the one seen last week to protect national security. While Guzm\u00e1n and lawyers said detainees were no threat because they were already carrying out sentences in Mexico, Vigil was quick to point out that capos often use Mexican prisons as centers for their criminal operations.",
      "\u201cSheinbaum did it to enhance cooperation with the U.S. government, but at the same time she understands that these individuals, if they remain in prisons there \u2026 they usually have access to their criminal organizations, have access through phones,\u201d Vigil said. \u201cThese fast tracks are extremely valuable in terms of making sure they face justice.\u201d",

      "After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week\u2019s meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won\u2019t like the result",
      "WASHINGTON -- After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week's meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won't like the result.",
      "The central bank's interest rate-setting committee is almost certain to keep its key short-term rate unchanged at about 3.6%, after three straight quarter-point cuts last year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after December's meeting that they were \u201cwell positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\u201d before making any further moves.",
      "When the Fed lowers its short-term rate, it can over time influence other borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, though those rates are also affected by market forces.",
      "This week's meeting \u2014 one of eight the Fed holds each year \u2014 will be overshadowed by the bombshell revelation earlier this month that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed as part of a criminal investigation into testimony Powell gave last June about a $2.5 billion building renovation. It's the first time a sitting Fed chair has been investigated, and prompted an unusually public rebuke from Powell.",
      "Now, Powell will have to shift from a dispute with the White House to emphasizing that the Fed's decisions around interest rates are driven by economic concerns, not politics. Powell said Jan. 11 that the subpoenas were \u201cpretexts\u201d to punish the Fed for not cutting rates as sharply as Trump wants.",
      "Powell will be \"under even more pressure to underscore, \u2018everything we\u2019re doing here ... is all about the economics,\u2019\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and chief economist at New Century Advisors. \"'We didn\u2019t think about the politics.'\u201d",
      "Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley and also a former Fed staffer, said that despite the scrutiny, the Fed can be expected to consider its interest rate policies like it always does.",
      "\u201cThe meetings have a regular flow to them,\u201d he said. \"There are presentations that are made, there are discussions that have to be had. ... Some of these other broader-based attacks on the Fed don't really come up.\"",
      "Not long after the Justice Department's subpoenas, the Supreme Court last week considered whether Trump can fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed's 112-year history. During an oral argument, the justices appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved.",

      "Other Fed officials have also signaled the central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged at their two-day meeting that ends Wednesday. The Fed's three rate cuts last year were intended to bolster the economy after hiring slowed sharply over the summer and fall in the wake of Trump's April tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Yet the unemployment rate ticked lower in December, after picking up for much of last year, and there are other signs the job market may be stabilizing. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits has stayed historically low, a sign layoffs haven't spiked.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation remains elevated and actually ticked higher last year, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Prices rose 2.8% in November from a year earlier, the latest data available. That is up from 2.6% in November 2024.",
      "Unless businesses start cutting jobs or the unemployment rate rises, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates again for at least a few months, economists say. If inflation slowly declines this year, as economists expect, the Fed may cut again in the spring or summer. Wall Street investors expect just two quarter-point rate reductions this year, according to futures prices.",
      "Many economists expect growth could pick up in the coming months, which would be another reason to forego rate cuts. Gapen estimates that tax refunds could be about 20% higher this spring than last year as the Trump administration's tax cuts take effect. Refunds could average $3,500, Gapen said.",
      "The economy expanded at a 4.4% annual rate in last year's July-September quarter and may have grown at a similarly healthy pace in the final three months of last year. If such solid growth continues, Fed officials will likely wait to see if hiring picks up as well, further reducing the need for more rate cuts.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced that his border czar, Tom Homan, will visit Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of an ICU nurse",
      "President Donald Trump announced that his border czar, Tom Homan, will go to Minneapolis this week following the fatal shooting of an ICU nurse Saturday in the Midwestern city that has become the epicenter of opposition to the president\u2019s controversial immigration crackdown.",
      "Homan\u2019s arrival comes as protests across the city have intensified following videos and eye witness accounts of Alex Pretti's fatal shooting that directly contradict the Trump administration\u2019s official narrative. Homan\u2019s planned trip also coincides with growing calls by Republicans and Democrats alike for an independent investigation into immigration enforcement tactics, which have drawn more scrutiny since agents fatally shot a different Minneapolis resident in her car weeks earlier.",
      "Here is what to know about Homan ahead of his arrival in the Twin Cities.",
      "Homan, 64, started his career in 1984 as a Border Patrol agent before moving to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2003 when the agency was created as part of Homeland Security. He was a relatively low-key but influential figure on immigration enforcement in the Obama administration, heading ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm, which was tasked with tracking down people with outstanding deportation orders and removing them from the country.",
      "Despite unwavering enthusiasm for Trump and withering criticism of President Joe Biden, he is seen by some as a voice of restraint and moderation compared with some in the current administration.",
      "Homan, who is widely associated with immigration enforcement actions that separated families, was given a Presidential Rank Award by the Obama administration to tout his efficacy in 2015.",
      "Homan was at his retirement party in January 2017 when Trump\u2019s choice for homeland security secretary, John Kelly, asked him to stay at ICE. Homan accepted after taking a weekend to think about it and became a leading figure in the Trump administration through four tumultuous years.",
      "Under Obama, the U.S. carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept. Deportations under the first Trump administration never topped 350,000.",
      "When he was appointed border czar, Homan was seen as a leader who not only aligned with Trump ideologically, but who also had significant practical experience in immigration policy.",
      "Homan portrays illegal immigration as black-and-white and has made no apologies for Trump\u2019s policy of targeting everyone in the country without status, not just those with criminal histories, public safety concerns and recent border crossers.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the country illegally, you should be concerned,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Just like if I go speeding down the highway, are you worried about getting a ticket? If you lie on your taxes, are you worried about an audit?\u201c",
      "\"People ask me all the time, why did you remove that guy who\u2019s been here 12 years and has two U.S. citizen kids. I said because he had his due process,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cPeople think I enjoy this. I\u2019m a father. People don\u2019t think this bothers me. I feel bad about the plight of these people.

      "\u201cYou concentrate on the public safety threats and the national security threats first, because they\u2019re the worst of the worst,\u201d he said on the show. He also said ICE would move to implement Trump\u2019s plans in a \u201chumane manner.\u201d",

He was added to the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last March when authorities offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.",
      "Authorities say Wedding moved as much as 60 tons of cocaine between Colombia, Mexico, Canada and Southern California and believe he was working under the protection of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug rings. His drug trafficking group was the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, according to a 2024 indictment.",
      "Mexican officials said he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City last week and was flown to Southern California after a yearlong effort by authorities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Colombia and the Dominican Republic to arrest him.",
      "When speaking to reporters Monday outside the federal court in Santa Ana, southeast of Los Angeles, Wedding's defense attorney Anthony Colombo disputed that his client had turned himself in in Mexico and said he was living in Mexico, not hiding out there.",
      "\u201cHe was arrested,\u201d Colombo said after the brief hearing, offering no further details. \u201cHe did not surrender.\u201d",
      "Colombo said his client was in \u201cgood spirits\" but added that \u201cthis has been a whirlwind for Mr. Wedding.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors declined to comment after the hearing. Wedding was scheduled to be back in court Feb. 11 and a trial date was set for Mar. 24.",
      "Wedding arrived in court wearing a tan jail jumpsuit with his ankles chained. He smiled briefly, then clasped his hands and leaned back in his chair before reviewing papers with his attorney. When asked by U.S. Magistrate John D. Early if he read the indictments filed against him, Wedding answered, \u201cI\u2019ve read them both, yes.\u201d",

      "The judge ordered him held in custody, saying he could not immediately find conditions that would ensure public safety or Wedding\u2019s appearance in court. He said he could consider bond if Wedding seeks it later.",
      "Mexico has increasingly sent detained cartel members to the U.S. as the country attempts to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said last month U.S. forces \u201cwill now start hitting land\u201d south of the border to target drug trafficking rings.",
      "Wedding was indicted in 2024 on federal charges of running a criminal enterprise, murder, conspiring to distribute cocaine and other crimes. U.S. authorities allege in court papers that Wedding\u2019s group obtained cocaine from Colombia and worked with Mexican cartels to move drugs by boat and plane to Mexico and then into the U.S. using semitrucks. The group stored cocaine in Southern California before sending it to Canada and other U.S. states, according to the indictment.",
      "The murder charges accuse Wedding of directing the 2023 killings of two members of a Canadian family in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment, and for ordering a killing over a drug debt in 2024. Last year, Wedding was indicted on new charges of orchestrating the killing of a witness in Colombia to help him avoid extradition to the U.S.",
      "Wedding was previously convicted in the U.S. of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to prison in 2010. Online records show he was released from Bureau of Prisons custody in 2011.",
      "In Canada, Wedding faces separate drug charges dating back to 2015.",

      "The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships have arrived in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships have arrived in the Middle East, bringing a renewed potential that President Donald Trump could opt to order airstrikes on Iran over its crackdown on protesters.",
      "The carrier, along with three destroyers, \u201cis currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability,\u201d U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.",
      "The strike group was in the Indian Ocean, Central Command said, and not in the Arabian Sea, which borders Iran. It will bring thousands of additional service members to the region, which has not had a U.S. aircraft carrier since the USS Gerald R. Ford was ordered in October to sail to the Caribbean as part of a pressure campaign on then-Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Trump told reporters last week that the ships were sent to the region \u201cjust in case.\u201d \u201cWe have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won\u2019t have to use it,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump earlier had threatened military action if Iran carried out mass executions of prisoners or killed peaceful demonstrators during a crackdown on protests that began in late December. At least 5,973 people have been killed and more than 41,800 detained, according to activists. The official Iranian death toll is far lower, at 3,117 dead.",
      "More recently, Trump appeared to have backed away from possible action, claiming Iran halted the hangings of 800 detained protesters. He has not elaborated on the source of the claim, which Iran\u2019s top prosecutor called \u201ccompletely false.\u201d",

Iran launched over a dozen missiles at Al Udeid Air Base days after the strikes.",

      "The ban was one of several ways the Trump administration made life harder for international students during his first year back in the White House, including a pause in visa appointments and additional layers of vetting that contributed to a dip in foreign enrollment for first-time students. New students had to look elsewhere, but the hurdles made life particularly complicated for those like Thaw who were well into their U.S. college careers.",

      "So many things went wrong last Jan. 29 to contribute to the deadliest plane crash on American soil since 2001 that the National Transportation Safety Board isn't likely to identify a single cause of the collision between an airliner and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people at its hearing Tuesday.",
      "Instead, their investigators will detail what they found that played a role in the crash, and the board will recommend changes to help prevent a similar tragedy. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration already took the temporary restrictions it imposed after the crash and made them permanent to ensure planes and helicopters won't share the same airspace again around Reagan National Airport.",
      "Family members of victims hope those suggestions won't be ignored the same way many past NTSB recommendations have been. Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the first officer on the American Airlines plane, said he hopes officials in Congress and the administration will make changes now instead of waiting until for another disaster.",
      "\u201cInstead of writing aviation regulation in blood, let\u2019s start writing it in data,\u201d said Lilley, who is a pilot himself and earlier in his career flew Black Hawk helicopters in the Washington area. \u201cBecause all the data was there to show this accident was going to happen. This accident was completely preventable.\u201d",
      "Over the past year, the NTSB has already highlighted a number of the factors that contributed to the crash including a poorly designed helicopter route past Reagan Airport, the fact that the Black Hawk was flying 78 feet (23.7 meters) higher than it should have been, the warnings that the FAA ignored in the years beforehand and the Army's move to turn off a key system that would have broadcast the helicopter\u2019s location more clearly.",
      "The D.C. plane crash was the first in a number of high-profile crashes and close calls throughout 2025 that alarmed the public, but the total number of crashes last year was actually the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 with 1,405 crashes nationwide.",
      "Experts say flying remains the safest way to travel because of all the overlapping layers of precautions built into the system, but too many of those safety measures failed at the same time last Jan. 29.",
      "Here is some of what we have learned about the crash:",
      "The route along the Potomac River the Black Hawk was following that night allowed for helicopters and planes to come within 75 feet (23 meters) of each other when a plane was landing on the airport's secondary runway that typically handles less than 5% of the flights landing at Reagan. And that distance was only ensured when the helicopter stuck to flying along the bank of the river, but the official route didn't require that.",
      "Normally, air traffic controllers work to keep aircraft at least 500 feet (152 meters) apart to keep them safe, so the scant separation on Route 4 posed what NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called \u201can intolerable risk to flight safety.\u201d",
      "The controllers at Reagan also had been in the habit of asking pilots to watch out for other aircraft themselves and maintain visual separation as they tried to squeeze in more planes to land on what the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority has called the busiest runway in the country. The FAA halted that practice after the crash.",
      "That night a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. But at the investigative hearings last summer, board members questioned how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",

      "Before investigators revealed how high the helicopter was flying, Tim Lilley was asking tough questions about it at some of the first meetings NTSB officials had with the families. His background as a pilot gave him detailed knowledge of the issues.",
      "\u201cWe had a moral mandate because we had such an in-depth insight into what happened. We didn\u2019t want to become advocates, but we could not shirk the responsibility,\u201d said Lilley, who started meeting with top lawmakers in Congress, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Army officials not long after the crash to push for changes.",
      "The NTSB has said the Black Hawk pilots may not have realized how high the helicopter was because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.",

The rules say helicopters and planes can't share the same airspace around Reagan National Airport, and they prohibit air traffic controllers from relying on visual separation and require all military aircraft to broadcast their locations.",
      "Here's a timeline of events related to the crash:",
      "Around 8:15 p.m., American Airlines Flight 5342, with 64 people on board, begins its initial descent into Reagan National Airport.",
      "At 8:43, from the airport\u2019s tower, a controller asks the plane's pilots to switch from landing on Runway 1 to Runway 33. Nearby an Army Black Hawk helicopter, referred to as PAT25 by air traffic control, is flying south over the river. The skies are clear.",
      "As the helicopter approaches the airport, the cockpit voice recorder captures the pilot saying it is flying at 300 feet (91 meters) and the instructor pilot says it is at 400 feet (122 meters). The discrepancy isn't explained and the helicopter continues to descend. The helicopter route\u2019s allowed altitude decreases the closer it gets to the airport, capping at 200 feet (61 meters).",
      "At 8:46, the controller radios the Black Hawk crew to say a passenger jet, referred to as CRJ, is at 1,200 feet (365 meters) and circling to Runway 33. The helicopter's pilots say they see the jet and ask to maintain visual separation \u2014 to fly closer than if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approve the request.",
      "At 8:47 \u2014 20 seconds before impact \u2014 the controller radios: \u201cPAT25, do you have the CRJ in sight?\u201d while a conflict alarm sounds. Then, again: \u201cPAT25, pass behind the CRJ.\u201d But the NTSB said the helicopter's recorder shows the pilots may never have heard that instruction.",
      "One second later the plane\u2019s crew gets a collision avoidance alert declaring \u201cTraffic! Traffic!\u201d",
      "A few seconds later, a crew member on the helicopter replies that the aircraft \u201cis in sight\u201d and again requests \u201cvisual separation.\"",
      "Just after the plane descends past its last recorded altitude of 313 feet (95 meters), the pilots pull up the nose sharply in an evasive maneuver one second before impact.",
      "Then a commotion is heard on the tower audio. A flash appears in the sky, and both aircraft fall into the river. Moments later someone says over the radio, \u201cTower, did you see that?\u201d",

    "summary": "As the face of Revlon, Lauren Hutton \u2013 called a \"believable beauty\" \u2013 became the highest-paid model in history, and still holds the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue. She talks about her adventurous life of no regrets.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 09:39:52 -0500",
    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",
      "\"But she could get away with it,\" Addie said. \"She could do this with total strangers.\"",
      "While her works fetch millions at auction now, Asawa didn't find much commercial success during her lifetime. But that wasn't her purpose, say her children.",
      "Asked what she hopes people discover from her mother's work, Addie replied, \"I think people breathe. I think people take a big, deep breath and go, 'Oh my God.' I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth. Do something with your life, you know? Learn a technique, do something, pass it on, right?\"",

      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice.

      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",

      "The Sundance Film Festival, America's leading showcase for independent narrative and documentary films from the United States and around the world, opens its 2026 edition on Thursday. This year's festival presents nearly 100 features through Feb. 1, in-person\u00a0in Utah and online.",
      "This year's program includes dramatic films with stars including Natalie Portman, Channing Tatum, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Ethan Hawke, Keegan Michael-Key, and Charli XCX. There's also a lineup of documentaries whose subjects include singers Courtney Love and Marianne Faithfull, tennis legend Billie Jean King, author Salman Rushdie, and topics like artificial intelligence, summitting K2, and children competing to sell the most Girl Scout cookies.",
      "The festival's screenings will be held in-person in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, while online screenings will be accessible for audiences across the country beginning Jan. 29. There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",
      "There are also Audience Awards, which in the past have gone to such films as \"sex, lies and videotape,\" \"Hoop Dreams,\" \"Whale Rider,\" \"Hustle & Flow,\" \"Once,\" \"Searching for Sugar Man,\" \"Fruitvale Station,\" \"Whiplash,\" \"CODA,\" and \"20 Days in Mariupol.\"",
      "The following is a small selection of the festival's offerings, most of which are premieres, and many of which are still seeking theatrical distribution.",
      "Documentaries",
      "Among the nonfiction offerings at Sundance this year are profiles of author Salman Rushdie, and how he survived a 2022 assassination attempt (\"Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie\"); singer, songwriter and actress Courtney Love, who prepares for her first new music release in a decade, in \"Antiheroine\"; chess prodigy Judit Polg\u00e1r (\"Queen of Chess\"); and centenarians and the always-changing titleholder of \"The Oldest Person in the World.\"",
      "\"Broken English\" is a genre-twisting tribute to Marianne Faithfull, who died a year ago, and features Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Nick Cave, Suki Waterhouse and others painting a portrait of the singer-songwriter.",
      "Justice, civil rights and equality are the themes of \"Who Killed Alex Odeh?\"\u00a0about the search for truth in the 1985 California bombing that killed a prominent Palestinian American activist; \"Everybody to Kenmure Street,\"\u00a0in which hundreds of residents in a Scottish neighborhood fight off a deportation raid affecting their neighbors; \"Soul Patrol,\"\u00a0a history of the first Black special operations team of the Vietnam War; and \"Sentient,\"\u00a0an investigation into laboratory research on primates.",
      "\"Troublemaker\" draws on recordings of Nelson Mandela to recount the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. In \"When a Witness Recants,\" author Ta-Nehisi Coates revisits a 1983 Baltimore murder case and discovers that three teenagers were wrongfully convicted. In \"American Doctor,\" three doctors from the U.S. enter Gaza and are caught between medicine and politics. International human rights lawyer Jennifer Robinson fights the use of defamation laws to silence survivors of sexual abuse in \"Silenced.\"",
      "\"Ghost in the Machine\" examines the origins of artificial intelligence. In\u00a0\"The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,\"\u00a0co-directors Charlie Tyrell and Daniel Roher (the Oscar-winning director of \"Navalny\") explore the existential dangers and promised benefits of artificial intelligence.",
      "Environmental stories include \"The Lake,\" about a looming toxic catastrophe emerging from Utah's Great Salt Lake; and\u00a0\"Nuisance Bear,\" about a polar bear whose habitat is threatened by human expansion. In \"Time and Water,\" Iceland's disappearing glaciers are but one measure of family history, memory and the elements for Icelandic writer Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason.",
      "In\u00a0\"To Hold a Mountain,\"\u00a0a single mother and her teenaged daughter, shepherds in Montenegro, fight to protect their ancestral home from becoming a NATO military training ground, while also adjusting to changing dynamics in their relationship. Shot over 10 years, Itab Azzam and Jack MacInnes' \"One in a Million\" follows a girl navigating war and heartbreak as she travels from Syria to Germany, and later returns to Aleppo.",
      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified in his lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "But the two Jewish New Yorkers bonded over their backgrounds and shared work ethic. With Stanley, Simmons said, \"One and one is three.\"",
      "Next is Christopher \"Tricky Stewart,\" who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonc\u00e9's blockbuster hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" Raised in a musical family in Markham, Illinois, Stewart was writing songs by age 12.",
      "His big break came in 2007, with what he calls the \"single most important song\" he's ever written: Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He once told MTV about the song's success, \"When she recorded the 'ellas,' you knew your life was about to change if you had anything to do with that record.\"",
      "You oughta know the next artist on the list: Alanis Morissette.",
      "Morissette's breakup anthem, \"You Oughta Know,\" was written from what she described as fractured devastation. With her blistering lyrics, the Canadian singer set off a cultural earthquake. Her 1995 album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" sold 33 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"When I write songs, everything that jumps to the fore \u2013 lyrically and musically \u2013 is that which I have sublimated or repressed. So, it's all my unconscious writing,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers in November.",

      "\"There's just a part of my brain that's kind of scoring everything,\" Loggins said in a 2022 PBS interview.",
      "Then there's Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote and co-produced Mariah Carey's No. 1 smash, \"Hero.\" And then again, for the holiday classic, \"All I Want For Christmas is You.\"",
      "\"We'd play musical ping pong,\" he's said of his more than 11-year collaboration with Carey.",

That will only offset a portion of the $2.5 billion the state is losing in federal tax credit assistance,\u00a0according\u00a0to Healthinsurance.org.",
      "Colorado is offering ACA participants with income up to 400% of the federal poverty level an $80 subsidy to offset their monthly premium, along with an additional $29 for each family member covered under the plan.",
      "States that directly provide their own subsidies to ACA enrollees must operate their own exchange outside of HealthCare.gov, the government website most Americans use to register for Obamacare. That's because the federal enrollment portal isn't set up to calculate additional tax subsidies beyond the ones offered at the federal level, Norris explained.",
      "In all, 20 states have their own exchanges, most of which are in states controlled by Democrats, she noted. States without their own exchanges can still offer ACA subsidies, but would do so using another mechanism, Norris said.",

    "summary": "The IRS started accepting tax returns on Jan. 26. Here's everything you need to know about getting your tax refund.",
    "story": [
      "Americans can file their 2025 tax returns with the IRS starting on Monday, Jan. 26, but what many people really want to know is when they can expect their refund.",
      "That depends largely on whether you file electronically \u2014 as 93% of taxpayers did during last year's tax season \u2014 or if you submit a paper return. Because the latter requires IRS employees to process the file, it can take much longer for these filers to get their refund checks.",
      "Some experts also\u00a0warn\u00a0that taxpayers could face customer service issues with the IRS this season, pointing to\u00a0employee cuts at the agency last year and fallout from the federal shutdown, when many workers were furloughed at a time the agency is usually preparing for tax season.",
      "\"Taxpayers might want to lower their expectations and prepare for unanswered phone calls to the IRS and delays in tax refunds, given these ingredients for a problem-prone filing season,\" Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a blog post\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "What is the refund timeframe for electronic tax filers?",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days, according to the IRS. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "On Monday, the IRS said in a statement that it started phasing out paper refund checks late last year. As a result, most taxpayers must provide the tax agency with their bank routing and account numbers to receive their refund through direct deposit.",
      "After you get a notice from the \"Where's My Refund?\" app that the IRS has sent your check, it could take up to five days for the refund to appear in your bank account, the IRS says.",
      "What if I claimed the EITC or ACTC?",
      "Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), refundable tax credits designed for low- to moderate-income working families, may face a longer wait for their refunds.",
      "That's because, by law, the IRS is required to hold these returns longer, giving the agency longer to scan for fraud or misapplied tax credits. About one-third of EITC claims are paid in error because some taxpayers may not understand whether they qualify for it, the IRS says.",
      "People who claimed either the EITC or the ACTC won't get their refund until March 2, at the earliest, the IRS said Monday.",
      "How can I track my refund?",
      "Filers should check the IRS's \"Where's My Refund\" tool to get an update on the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "People who file paper returns will need to wait about four weeks for their status to show up in the \"Where's My Refund\" app, because it takes longer for those filings to get logged by IRS employees compared with automated processing of e-filed returns.",
      "What information do I need for \"Where's My Refund\"?",
      "The IRS says you'll need to provide the following info to use the agency's \"Where's My Refund?\" app:",
      "Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)Filing status, such as \"married filing jointly\"Exact refund amount on your return",

      "Refund Sent. This means the IRS sent the refund to your bank or to you in the mail.",
      "How big will this year's tax refunds be?",
      "Annual tax refunds are often the biggest checks that households receive each year, with payments last year averaging almost $3,200, according to IRS data.",
      "This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check\u00a0set to increase\u00a0by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis. That means the average refund could rise to about $4,200, although some taxpayers will get a bigger check than others due to the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "For instance, older Americans who can claim the new $6,000 senior deduction may get a bigger boost, as well as homeowners who can claim the expanded $40,000 state and local tax deduction.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "Gold prices soared past $5,000 per ounce for the first time as investors flocked to the safe-haven asset amid rising geopolitical uncertainty and U.S. economic concerns.",
      "The precious metal topped $5,100 in trading on Monday, while silver and platinum also reached all-time highs, surpassing $100 and $2,800, respectively. Gold has nearly doubled from a year ago, when it traded for around $2,660.",
      "Monday's rally came after President Trump said over the weekend that he would impose a\u00a0100% import tax on Canada if the country strikes a trade deal with China. That followed a separate threat by Mr. Trump to impose levies on eight\u00a0European nations over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland.",
      "The president eventually relented on those tariff threats after announcing that he and the secretary-general of NATO had agreed on the contours of a deal over Greenland.",

      "The surge in gold is also rooted in concern over government borrowing, as debt levels across the U.S. and other major economies continue to mount. In May, Moody's Ratings\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0from the highest level \u2014 Aaa \u2014 to Aa1, one notch lower, citing rising U.S. government debt.",

    "summary": "Only one in four Americans has a credit score above 800, which is considered exceptional, according to industry data.",
    "story": [
      "Achieving a credit score of 800 or higher can help unlock the lowest interest rates for products ranging from auto loans to credit cards, but only one in four Americans has managed to reach that level, according to credit bureau Experian.",
      "Lenders typically view scores above 800 as \"exceptional,\" a signal that a borrower consistently pays bills on time and manages debt responsibly. Most banks rely on the FICO score, developed by Fair Isaac Corp., which ranges from 300 to a maximum of 850, to assess a consumer's creditworthiness.",
      "Hitting that 800-point milestone may be more critical in 2026 than ever before.",
      "The new urgency stems from President Trump's recent push for a 10%\u00a0cap on credit card interest rates. While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",

      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",

      "The typical American family earns far too little to comfortably afford child care, according to a new analysis.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) considers child care affordable when households spend no more than 7% of their total annual income on such services. By that measure, households need an income of nearly $403,000 to cover the cost of care for two children, LendingTree, an online loan marketplace, estimates.",
      "As of 2024 (the last year for which data is available), the median annual family income in the U.S. was\u00a0$105,800, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Families with two children spend an average of $2,252 per month for full-time child care \u2014 more than the cost of rent in dozens of the country's largest cities, according to other LendingTree\u00a0figures.",
      "\"Child care costs are just incredibly daunting for all but the wealthiest Americans,\" Matt Schulz, a chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, told CBS News. \"It forces parents into some really tough choices, including whether to have kids or not.\"",
      "Schulz said the report makes clear that limiting child care costs to 7% of your income \"just isn't realistic anymore.\" Federal labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows that families spend between 8.9% and 16% of their median income on full-time care for one child in 2022 (the latest data available).",
      "The rising cost of child care has become a focal point for lawmakers and policymakers amid public concerns about affordability, while some leaders are taking action. In New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul earlier this month announced a plan for free child care for 2-year-olds, part of Mamdani's\u00a0broader push to bring universal child care to New York City.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

      "Tesla cited \"uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy\" as some of the headwinds it was facing in a presentation\u00a0last year. The company remains the dominant seller of electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for around 46% in 2025.",

      "With temperatures plunging in some states as a\u00a0massive winter storm bears down across the U.S., some electric vehicle owners could face a cold, hard truth: EVs can lose efficiency in low temperatures, curtailing their driving ranges.",
      "The issue drew widespread attention in January 2024, when some Chicago-area Tesla owners found their EVs' batteries had died in subzero temperatures. Other EV owners have posted online about their vehicles' shorter ranges in winter.",
      "Cold weather can slow an EV battery's chemical and physical reactions, reducing vehicle power. And unlike conventional cars with an internal combustion engine, an EV can't tap its motor's heat to warm the interior. Instead, EVs must tap their batteries to provide cabin heat, which can sap their range, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "At 16 degrees Fahrenheit, EVs lose about 25% of their range when driving at about 70 mph, versus their range when driving at the same speed in mid-60-degree temperatures, Consumer Reports found in road testing.",

      "Temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic states.",
      "Are newer EVs better at handling the cold?",
      "Car manufacturers have made some changes that mean newer EVs perform better in cold temperatures, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, an industry trade group.",
      "Newer EVs have heat pumps and better battery encasements that can help improve battery efficiency, ZETA noted. South Korean automaker Kia says that its new EV models include advanced heat pumps, which extract heat from the outside air, even in cold weather, and transfer it to the cabin, leaving the EV with more energy available for driving.",
      "Other EVs with heat pumps include the Acura ZDX and Volvo EX40, according to a list\u00a0published by electric-vehicle research firm Recurrent.",

      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice.

      "There was no similar surge in demand during the same period a year ago.",
      "\"In short, the strong lift seen so far this year did not exist during the same stretch last season, which could suggest that something beyond normal NHL demand patterns may be at play,\" SeatGeek added.",
      "SeatGeek also saw a rise in both single-ticket sales among fans attending games on their own, plus stronger demand from first-time game attendees.",
      "\"'Heated Rivalry' has certainly piqued interest in hockey and the NHL,\" SeatGeek marketing director Chris Leyden said in a statement. \"We are seeing it both in terms of more people on SeatGeek shopping for NHL tickets, as well as a pretty notable increase in single ticket buyers as more people check out a game, often for the first time ever.\"",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "After O'Leary relayed that decision last week, Musk said on social media that the airline leader was \"misinformed.\" O'Leary subsequently told an Irish radio station that \"I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk, he's an idiot.\"",

      "O'Leary, who has led Ryanair as CEO for more than three decades, said on Wednesday that Musk is free to launch a takeover bid for the airline, while noting that rules bar non-European citizens from owning a majority stake in a European airline.",

      "Washington \u2014 The families of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. missile strike on a boat in the Caribbean in October sued the Trump administration in federal court, arguing the \"premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification.\"",
      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Oregon in September seeking its voter registration list, which contains the sensitive information of nearly 3.8 million registered voters.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit Monday that sought sensitive voter information from the state.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai is the latest setback for the Trump administration in its efforts to obtain copies of voter registration lists from dozens of states. Earlier this month, a federal judge in California rejected the Justice Department's bid to get sensitive information related to the 23 million voters on its voter rolls, calling it \"unprecedented and illegal.\"",
      "An entry on the docket for the Oregon case indicated that Kasubhai granted the state's request to dismiss the suit and would soon issue a formal opinion detailing his reasoning.",
      "\"The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,\" Oregon Attorney General Day Rayfield said in a statement. \"Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can't be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.\"",
      "The Justice Department sued Oregon in September and sought a court order directing the state to turn over its voter registration list of nearly 3.8 million registered voters, which contains sensitive information including addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.",
      "The lawsuit alleged that Oregon and its secretary of state, Tobias Read, violated federal voting laws by refusing to turn over the unredacted copy of the state's voter rolls.",
      "But in seeking to have the case dismissed, Oregon officials argued that the Justice Department was not legally entitled to the sensitive voter information it was demanding. They also said that federal privacy law prohibits the government from collecting records of conduct protected by the First Amendment.",
      "Kasubhai, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier this month on the state's effort to have the lawsuit dismissed. But he scheduled another proceeding for Monday to discuss a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about immigration enforcement activities in the state.",
      "In the letter, dated Saturday, Bondi urged Walz to cooperate with the Trump administration in three areas to \"bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans.\" One of the steps the attorney general specified was to give the Justice Department access to Minnesota's voter rolls, which she said would \"better guarantee free and fair elections and boost confidence in the rule of law.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom in-person on Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier order.",
      "Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in a brief three-page order\u00a0that the Trump administration has failed to comply with \"dozens\" of court orders in recent weeks, which has resulted in \"significant hardship\" to immigrants who have been arrested and detained as part of Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz wrote that he has been \"extremely patient\" with administration officials, even though they sent thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally \"without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.\"",
      "\"The court's patience is at an end,\" he wrote.",
      "Schiltz, appointed by President George W. Bush, ordered Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, to appear \"personally\" before the court and \"show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.\" CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment on the judge's action.",
      "\"The court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have tried and failed,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Schiltz's order came in a case involving an Ecuadorian man, Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, who came to the U.S. illegally in 1999 when he was a minor. He was detained earlier this month and placed in immigration custody at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, according to court filings.",
      "Tobay Robles challenged his detention in federal district court, and Schiltz issued an order last week requiring federal immigration authorities to either provide him with a bond hearing within seven days or immediately release him from custody if a hearing was not provided.",
      "Tobay Robles' lawyers informed the court on Friday that his client had not received a bond hearing and was still in immigration custody.",
      "Schiltz wrote in his latest order that Lyons would not be required to appear if Tobay Robles' lawyers and the administration filed papers indicating that the Ecuadorian man had been released from custody.",
      "The Trump administration's enforcement operations in the Twin Cities have left the federal court there inundated with petitions from immigrants challenging their detentions and seeking release. A judge in Minnesota is separately considering a bid by state officials to altogether bring an end to Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz himself tangled with the Trump administration last week after the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit to order the lower court to sign arrest warrants for five people in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a church in St. Paul earlier this month. A unanimous panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit declined the administration's request.",
      "Three people have been charged in connection with the demonstration, but a U.S. magistrate judge declined to issue arrest warrants for the five others, which included former CNN anchor Don Lemon.",
      "The Justice Department sought review of the magistrate judge's finding and then turned to the 8th Circuit after Schiltz, who was assigned the matter, did not \u2014 in the administration's view \u2014 move quickly enough.",
      "In a letter to the 8th Circuit, Schiltz said the Trump administration's efforts were \"unprecedented\" and said \"there is absolutely no emergency.\"",

    "summary": "The AAP is recommending immunization against 18 diseases.\u200b Earlier this month, the CDC reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

    "story": [
      "Congress is ratcheting up its scrutiny of the killing of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "Top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Monday asked Justice Department officials to hand over records about the probe of Pretti's killing to the panel by Monday, Feb. 2, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi obtained by CBS News.",
      "Democrats on the panel, including ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, are also seeking documents about the department's decision to forgo a civil rights investigation into the immigration agent who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.",
      "The letter accused the Trump administration of blocking local authorities from probing the two killings and failing to adequately investigate the Good shooting, pointing to reports that some federal prosecutors were told to look into Good's widow.",
      "\"Someone affirmatively ordered federal law enforcement to instead investigate Ms. Good's widow. Someone affirmatively ordered line agents to block state prosecutors from accessing key evidence. Someone is now taking the same actions with regard to the killing of another American citizen,\" the letter said.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the two shootings \u2014 which took place during a surge of immigration agents in Minneapolis \u2014 has drawn intense scrutiny.",
      "Prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were told they would not investigate Good's death, an unusual move for a fatal shooting by an officer. And several federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned amid pressure to look into Good's widow and treat the case as an assault on a federal officer, CBS News has reported. The department has accused Good of trying to run over an ICE agent with her car.",
      "Pretti's death is being investigated by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, FBI Director Kash Patel said. Current and former law enforcement officials told CBS News that move is unusual because HSI typically doesn't investigate shootings by officers.",
      "Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from the Good case earlier this month, saying the Justice Department had prevented state investigators from accessing evidence. And state authorities sued the federal government for allegedly blocking the BCA from accessing the scene of Pretti's death, leading a judge to bar the Department of Homeland Security from \"destroying or altering evidence.\"",
      "The House Democrats' inquiry argued there is a basis for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to investigate the shootings. The letter alleged the Trump administration could be making \"efforts to avoid accountability for several federal officers' deprivation of rights under color of law,\" referring to one criminal offense that's often investigated by the division.",
      "When asked for comment, a Justice Department spokesperson referred CBS News to a statement earlier this month by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, which said, \"There is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, an FBI spokesman said: \"The facts on the ground do not support a civil rights investigation. FBI continues to investigate the incident as well as the violent criminal actors and those perpetrating illegal activity.\"",
      "Other congressional panels have launched their own investigations. As CBS News reported Monday, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon to open a civil rights investigation into Good's death.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, has proposed a new legislative amendment that would require an independent Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General to \"deploy investigators to conduct investigations into all use of force incidents that have occurred\" under the Trump administration's civil immigration and interior enforcement operations.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, has also requested testimony from the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Paul's request was endorsed Monday by fellow Republican Sen. John Curtis, a first-term senator from Utah.",
      "Republican Rep. Andrew Garbarino, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, also requested testimony from the leaders of the same three agencies.",
      "Paul and Garbarino's letters did not mention Pretti or Good. But the requests for testimony came as a growing number of Republicans criticized or questioned the Trump administration's response to Pretti's death, or pressed for a full investigation.",

      "The Pennsylvania governor said the administration's tone appears to be changing, \"but the tactics haven't.\"",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is facing internal scrutiny within the Trump administration in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, but Noem is expected to keep her job.",
      "Sources said Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting and its response.",
      "Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "Noem and top aide Corey Lewandowski had elevated Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and tasked him with overseeing highly publicized and controversial immigration raids in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and, most recently, Minneapolis.",
      "The move \u2014 intended to bolster President Trump's mass deportation campaign \u2014 marked a significant change in tactics because immigration matters in the country's interior have historically been handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not Border Patrol.",
      "Bovino, who was given a new title of \"commander\" and reported directly to Noem, sparked internal rifts at DHS between those who supported his aggressive tactics and those who believed they were undermining public support for the administration's deportation campaign.",
      "Amid growing backlash over the administration's initial response to the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this month, Bovino will soon leave his post in Minnesota and return to his regular job along the U.S.-Mexico border as the chief agent in California's El Centro sector.",
      "One official said serious threats against Bovino in Minnesota, including death threats, factored into the administration's decision to pull him from the operation there.",
      "White House border czar Tom Homan, with whom sources say Noem has had a frosty working relationship, is now leading the Minneapolis operation. Sources told CBS News Homan was in the West Wing to strategize Monday, before departing for the Twin Cities.",
      "The White House is betting Homan can work with Democrats like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At Monday's White House briefing, Karoline Leavitt noted the Obama administration recognized Homan's work in 2016 when he served as a senior DHS official.",
      "\"And so he's obviously very qualified. He has the full trust and faith of the president,\" Leavitt said. Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Homan will meet with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, also a Democrat, on Tuesday.",
      "Both Noem and Bovino have faced heavy scrutiny over their reaction to the death of Pretti, who was shot by Border Patrol on Saturday.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him, and Bovino accused him of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" But videos of the incident do not show Pretti brandishing a gun, and one video appears to show an officer removing a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "Those comments drew public criticism from some congressional Republicans, who accused Noem of rushing to judgement. They also sparked anger within DHS, with some U.S. officials telling CBS News earlier Monday that top figures in the administration were mishandling the public messaging by making statements that aren't supported by evidence.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" said one DHS official requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "On Monday, dozens more congressional Democrats agreed to join as co-sponsors of legislation seeking to impeach Noem, amid the torrent of negative headlines and controversy.",
      "Pretti's death came amid a massive two-month-long surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis, with some 3,000 ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents arresting roughly 3,400 people in the area \u2014 drawing tense protests and criticism from local officials. The shooting came after another person in Minneapolis, Renee Good, was fatally shot by an ICE officer.",
      "Two weeks ago, a CBS News poll found 61% of Americans feel ICE is being too tough when stopping and detaining people, a five-point increase from November.

      "Alex Vindman, who became a key player along with his twin brother in President Donald Trump's first impeachment, announced on Tuesday that he is running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Florida.",
      "Vindman, an Army veteran, was serving on the National Security Council in 2019 when the Republican president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, then a Democratic candidate. He and his brother, Eugene, a lawyer on the National Security Council, reported their concerns and sparked investigations.",
      "Eugene Vindman now serves as a congressman from Virginia. If Alex Vindman clinches the Democratic nomination, he'll challenge Republican Sen. Ashley Moody, a former state attorney general who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Marco Rubio as he became secretary of state.",
      "The winner of November's special election will finish the last two years of Rubio's term.",
      "Vindman described Trump as \"wannabe tyrant\"",
      "Vindman described Mr. Trump as a \"wannabe tyrant\" and federal immigration agents as \"thug militias\" in his announcement video, which features the recent killing of two U.S. citizens during the deportation campaign in Minnesota.",
      "Vindman was forced out of the National Security Council and later retired from the Army after testifying against Mr. Trump during impeachment hearings. He said \"this president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family but against all of us.\"",
      "He urged voters to \"stand with me now to put a check on Donald Trump and the corrupt politicians who think your tax dollars are their personal piggybank.\"",
      "Vindman becomes the most prominent Democrat in the Florida Senate contest as the party tries to reclaim the Senate majority in this fall's midterm elections.",
      "Their task in Florida will not be easy. The onetime swing state, which is Mr. Trump's legal residence, has swung decidedly red in recent years. A Democrat has not won a Senate seat there since 2012.",
      "Still, Democrats are hopeful that Vindman's fundraising prowess and the national political environment \u2014 including the backlash against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown and his lack of focus on the economy \u2014 gives them a chance.",
      "Mr. Trump denied any wrongdoing when he was impeached, and he was acquitted by the Senate. He later was impeached over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and again was acquitted.",

    "summary": "Studies offer insights into the health risks and burdens faced by people who have had COVID infections. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has narrowed COVID vaccine recommendations and cut research.",
    "story": [
      "Possible risk of autism in children. Dormant cancer cells awakening. Accelerating aging of the brain.",
      "Federal officials in May 2023 declared an end to the national COVID pandemic. But more than two years later, a growing body of research continues to reveal information about the virus and its ability to cause harm long after initial infections resolve, even in some cases when symptoms were mild.",
      "The discoveries raise fresh concerns about the Trump administration's COVID policies, researchers say. While some studies show COVID vaccines offer protective benefits against longer-term health effects, the Department of Health and Human Services has drastically limited recommendations about who should get the shot. The administration also halted Biden-era contracts aimed at developing more protective COVID vaccines.",
      "The federal government is curtailing such efforts just as researchers call for more funding and, in some cases, long-term monitoring of people previously infected.",
      "\"People forget, but the legacy of COVID is going to be long, and we are going to be learning about the chronic effects of the virus for some time to come,\" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "The Trump administration said that the COVID vaccine remains available and that individuals are encouraged to talk with their health providers about what is best for them. The COVID vaccine and others on the schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain covered by insurance so that individuals don't need to pay out-of-pocket, officials said.",
      "\"Updating CDC guidance and expanding shared clinical decision-making restores informed consent, centers parents and clinicians, and discourages 'one size fits all' policies,\" said HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard.",
      "Although COVID has become less deadly, because of population immunization and mutations making the virus less severe, researchers say the politicization around the infection is obscuring what science is increasingly confirming: COVID's potential to cause unexpected, possibly chronic health issues. That in turn, these scientists say, drives the need for more, rather than less, research, because over the long term, COVID could have significant economic and societal implications, such as higher health care costs and more demands on social programs and caregivers.",
      "The annual average burden of the disease's long-term health effects is estimated at $1 trillion globally and $9,000 per patient in the U.S., according to a report published in November in the journal NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine. In this country, the annual lost earnings are estimated to be about $170 billion.",
      "One study estimates that the flu resulted in $16 billion in direct health costs and $13 billion in productivity losses in the 2023-2024 season, according to a Dec. 30 report in MedRxiv, an online platform that publishes work not yet certified by peer review.",
      "COVID's growing reach",
      "Much has been learned about COVID since the virus emerged in 2019, unleashing a pandemic that the World Health Organization reports has killed more than 7 million people. By the spring of 2020, the term \"long COVID\" had been coined to describe chronic health problems that can persist post-infection.",
      "More recent studies show that infection by the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, can result in heightened health risks months to more than a year later.",
      "For example, researchers following children born to mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant have discovered they may have an increased risk for autism, delayed speech and motor development, or other neurodevelopmental challenges.",
      "Another study found babies exposed to COVID in utero experienced accelerated weight gain in their first year, a possible harbinger of metabolic issues that could later carry an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.",
      "These studies suggest avoiding severe COVID in pregnancy may reduce risk not just during pregnancy but for future generations. That may be another good reason to get vaccinated when pregnant.",
      "\"There are other body symptoms apart from the developing fetal brain that also may be impacted,\" said Andrea Edlow, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School who was involved in both studies. \"We definitely need more research.\"",
      "Epidemiologists point to some specific, emerging challenges.",
      "A U.K. study in the New England Journal of Medicine found people who fully recovered from mild COVID infections experienced a cognitive deficit equal to a three-point drop in IQ. Among the more than 100,000 participants, deficits were greater in people who had persistent symptoms and reached the equivalent of a nine-point IQ drop for individuals admitted to intensive care.",
      "Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist who has studied longer-term health effects from COVID, did the math. He estimated COVID may have increased the number of adults in the U.S. with an IQ of less than 70 from 4.7 million to 7.5 million \u2014 a jump of 2.8 million adults dealing with \"a level of cognitive impairment that requires significant societal support,\" he wrote.",
      "\"People get COVID-19, some people do fine and bounce back, but there are people who start experiencing problems with memory, cognition, and fuzzy brain,\" he said. \"Even people with mild symptoms. They might not even be aware.\"",
      "Diane Yormark, 67, of Boca Raton, Florida, can relate. She got COVID in 2022 and 2023. The second infection left her with brain fog and fatigue.",
      "\"I felt like if you had a little bit too much wine the night before and you're out of it,\" said Yormark, a retired copywriter, who said the worst of her symptoms lasted for about three months after the infection. \"Some of the fog has lifted. But do I feel like myself? Not like I was.\"",
      "Data from more than a dozen studies suggests COVID vaccines can help reduce risk of severe infection as well as longer-lasting health effects, although researchers say more study is needed.",
      "But vaccination rates remain low in the U.S., with only about 17% of the adult population reporting that they got the updated 2025-2026 shot as of Jan. 16, based on CDC data.",
      "Trump administration officials led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have reduced access to COVID vaccines despite the lack of any new, substantiated evidence of harm. Though the shots were a hallmark achievement of the first Trump administration, which led the effort for their development, Kennedy has said without evidence that they are \"the deadliest vaccine ever made.\"",
      "In May he said on X that the CDC would stop recommending COVID shots for healthy children and pregnant women, citing a lack of clinical data. The Food and Drug Administration has since issued new guidelines limiting the vaccine to people 65 or older and individuals 6 months or older with at least one risk factor, though many states continue to make them more widely available.",
      "The Trump administration also halted almost $500 million in funding for mRNA-based vaccines. Administration officials and a number of Republicans question the safety of the Nobel Prize-winning technology \u2014 heralded for the potential to treat many diseases beyond COVID \u2014 even though clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers were performed before the COVID mRNA vaccines were made available to the public.",
      "And numerous studies, including new research in 2025, show COVID vaccine benefits include a reduction in the severity of disease, although the protective effects wane over time.",
      "Following the findings",
      "Researchers say more and broader support is important because much remains unknown about COVID and its impact on the body.",
      "The growing awareness that, even in mild COVID cases, the possibility exists for longer-term, often undetected organ damage also warrants more examination, researchers say. A study published this month in eBioMedicine found people with neurocognitive issues such as changes in smell or headaches after infection had significant levels of a protein linked to Alzheimer's in their blood plasma. EBioMedicine is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by The Lancet.",
      "In the brain, the virus leads to an immune response that triggers inflammation, can damage brain cells, and can even shrink brain volume, according to research on imaging studies that was published in March 2022 in the journal Nature.",
      "An Australian study of advanced brain images found significant alterations even among people who had already recovered from mild infections \u2014 a possible explanation for cognitive deficits that may persist for years. Lead study author Kiran Thapaliya said the research suggests the virus \"may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.\"",
      "Al-Alay agreed.",
      "\"We don't know what will happen to people 10 years down the road,\" he said. \"Inflammation of the brain is not a good thing. It's absolutely not a good thing.\"",
      "That inflammatory response has also been linked to blood clots, arrhythmias, and higher risk of cardiovascular issues, even following a mild infection.",
      "A University of Southern California study published in October 2024 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found the risk for a major cardiac event remains elevated nearly three years after COVID infection. The findings held even for people who were not hospitalized.",
      "\"We were surprised to see the effects that far out\" regardless of individual heart disease history, said James R. Hilser, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.",
      "COVID can also reactivate cancer cells and trigger a relapse, according to research published in July in the journal Nature. Researchers found that the chance of dying from cancer among cancer survivors was higher among people who'd had COVID, especially in the year after being infected. There was nearly a twofold increase in cancer mortality in those who tested positive compared with those who tested negative.",
      "The potential of the COVID virus to affect future generations is yielding new findings as well. Australian researchers looked at male mice and found that those who had been infected with and then recovered from COVID experienced changes to their sperm that altered their offspring's behavior, causing them to exhibit more anxiety.",
      "Meanwhile, many people are now living \u2014 and struggling \u2014 with the virus' after-effects.",
      "Dee Farrand, 57, of Marana, Arizona, could once run five miles and was excelling at her job in sales. She recovered from a COVID infection in May 2021.",
      "Two months later, her heart began to beat irregularly. Farrand underwent a battery of tests at a hospital. Ultimately, the condition became so severe she had to go on supplemental oxygen for two years.",
      "Her cognitive abilities declined so severely she couldn't read, because she'd forget the first sentence after reading the second. She also had to leave herself reminders that she is allergic to shrimp or that she likes avocados. She said she lost her job and returned to her previous occupation as a social worker.",
      "\"I was the person who is like the Energizer bunny and all of a sudden I'd get so tired getting dressed that I had to go back to bed,\" Farrand said.",
      "While she is better, COVID has left a mark. She said she's not yet able to run the five miles she used to do without any problems.",

      "The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump.

At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.",

Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\" and a \"domestic terrorist,\" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.",
      "GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve \"the tone with which they're describing this.\"",
      "\"Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,\" the senator said on Monday's episode of \"Verdict with Ted Cruz.\" \"And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.",
      "\"I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a \"transparent, independent investigation\" and for \"those responsible\" to be \"held accountable.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said administration officials rushing to judgment and trying to \"shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"",
      "Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans",
      "A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot \u2014 drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.",
      "Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often \"legally justified\" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that \"no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was \"adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point\" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.",
      "\"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said.",
      "Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them \"dangerous and wrong.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports \"a full and impartial investigation\" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.",
      "\"His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: \"Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'\"",
      "Shooting described as \"shocking\" and \"disturbing\"",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called Pretti's killing \"shocking\" and said it should \"raise serious questions\" about \"the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.\"",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a \"horrifying situation.\"",
      "\"My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,\" said Ricketts. \"I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.\"",
      "And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's \"troubled by the events that have unfolded.\"",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a \"real tragedy\" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its \"endgame,\" which he said can't be to \"deport every single non-U.S. citizen.\"",
      "\"I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,\" he said. \"Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.\"",
      "When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should \"recalibrate\" and \"maybe work from a different direction.\"",
      "He said immigration agencies should \"go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.\"",
      "Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an \"unmitigated disaster.\"",
      "\"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,\" he said.",
      "In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.",
      "GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a \"full investigation\" and said that \"we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's \"appalled at the violence in Minneapolis\" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities \u2014 provisions she said \"would make such incidents less likely to occur.\"",
      "In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.",
      "Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation",
      "Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.",
      "Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.",
      "The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.",
      "\"As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,\" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. \"Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.\"",

      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, three sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development, which effectively amounts to a demotion,  follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Bovino, citing no evidence, suggested over the weekend Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials were contradicted by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey earlier Monday. Frey said the president \"agreed that the present situation cannot continue.\"",
      "In recent months, Bovino has been one of the leading public faces of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, gaining notoriety due to his aggressive and outspoken approach for the job and for appearing in the field in tactical gear alongside rank-and-file Border Patrol personnel.",
      "Before arriving in Minneapolis earlier this month, he was dispatched to Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans last year.",
      "His presence in those cities was part of a significant change in tactics by the Trump administration, which has used Border Patrol agents to carry out immigration arrests hundreds of miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. At one point during a Chicago enforcement operation, known as Midway Blitz, Border Patrol had made more arrests than Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is normally responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Over that time, Bovino has drawn criticism from those who view the administration's immigration tactics as overly harsh and its response to protests heavy-handed \u2014 and plaudits from many supporters of the president who view him as a no-nonsense enforcer of his deportation campaign.",
      "He left Chicago in November, a week after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against federal immigration agents over their use of force during Operation Midway Blitz, saying it \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "Soon after Bovino took the helm, agents were seen deploying tear gas on residential neighborhood streets, near schools and against civilians.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sarah Ellis noted that Bovino has personally been involved in using tear gas at protests. And the judge said Bovino \"admitted that he lied\" about the circumstances that led up to one use of tear gas. At one point, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in court every evening at 6 p.m. to brief her about Border Patrol agents' actions.",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources told CBS News.",
      "Bovino has long defended the tactics used by Border Patrol agents, calling them necessary to quell riots that threatened federal law enforcement personnel.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino told CBS News in October.",
      "The White House has also publicly defended Bovino.",
      "\"Mr. Bovino is a wonderful man, and he is a great professional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday, before his departure from Minneapolis was reported. \"He is going to very much continue to lead [Customs and Border Protection] throughout and across the country.\"",

    "summary": "ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit is leading the probe of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer.",
    "story": [
      "Federal investigators are reviewing body-camera footage from multiple angles in the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, as new revelations about evidence handling \u2014 including a lack of documented chain of custody for his registered firearm \u2014 raise concerns about the integrity and credibility of the investigation.",
      "Pretti, who worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed by a Border Patrol officer around 9 a.m. Saturday in south Minneapolis.",
      "Two law enforcement officials told CBS News that body-camera footage from multiple federal agents exists and is currently under review. But it remains unclear if the footage will be released to the public.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked at a briefing Saturday about the FBI's role in the investigation and whether body-camera footage would be released. She did not commit to making the video public and deflected other questions, saying she would not \"speak to the investigation and the details\" while it continues.",
      "The investigation is being led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations under Special Agents in Charge Mark Zito and Jason Todd Stevens, with assistance from the FBI, according to multiple officials briefed on the case.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News on Sunday, \"All the pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS in HSI.\" But HSI lacks the ability to process certain kinds of material \u2014\u00a0 like scientific and forensic evidence including fingerprints, DNA, ballistic data and firearm-related physical evidence \u2014 so FBI investigators will be focusing on these aspects of the probe.",
      "Chain of custody for Pretti's handgun in question",
      "Multiple officials briefed on the investigation said there is no documented chain of custody for Pretti's handgun, a failure that could complicate forensic reliability and undermine any future criminal or civil rights prosecution.",
      "According to those officials, the firearm was placed on the seat of a vehicle, instead of being secured in a required plastic evidence bag and labeled with standard identifying details, including the date, the item, and the name of the last person who handled it.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later released a photograph of the weapon, which officials familiar with the evidence said appears to be a custom Sig Sauer P320 chambered in 9mm.",
      "Proper chain of custody typically ensures ballistics, fingerprint and DNA findings remain admissible. Deviations from protocol can become focal points in criminal defense challenges, civil rights litigation and internal discipline reviews.",
      "Sources briefed on the investigation add that the weapons of CBP agents at the scene of the officer-involved shooting have not been transferred to the FBI for analysis, raising questions about investigative practices, and it remains unclear exactly how many officers fired their weapons.",
      "Emerging questions about agents who fired shots and what took place",
      "Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino at a briefing Sunday declined to say how many agents fired, how many shots were discharged, or whether Pretti had brandished a weapon. He said investigators would determine those facts.",
      "Investigators have begun interviewing the agents who were on the scene, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday.",
      "At this point, the agents involved in the shooting remain on duty but have been reassigned outside Minneapolis, for \"their safety,\" Bovino said.",
      "\"All agents that were involved in that scene are working, not in Minneapolis, but in other locations,\" Bovino told reporters. \"That's for their safety. There's this thing called doxxing, and the safety of our employees is very important to us. We're going to keep those employees safe.\"",
      "Bovino charged that Pretti had interfered with a federal operation to arrest Jose Huerta Chuma, whom he described as an undocumented immigrant with a criminal record. He framed the shooting around \"choices,\" suggesting that Pretti had made \"the choice to come into an active law enforcement scene, interfere, obstruct, delay or assault (a) law enforcement officer and they bring a weapon to do that. That is a choice that that individual made.\"",
      "How these investigations typically work",
      "Former senior DHS, ICE and HSI officials have told CBS News that officer-involved shooting investigations usually follow strict protocols, including immediate scene control, independent investigative agency leadership and secure evidence collection with documented chain of custody.",
      "Investigations into officer-involved shootings are often coordinated with state and local authorities.",
      "But Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara has said local authorities have received virtually no official information from the federal agencies probing the shooting.",
      "\"There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation,\" O'Hara said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" \"More than once, [local investigators] were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.\"",
      "Normally, there would be a \"robust partnership\" between federal agencies, the FBI and local law enforcement in an investigation of this kind, a former DHS official said, adding this does not appear to be happening in the Pretti case.",
      "Another former HSI official called the crime scene \"compromised,\" warning the spoiling of evidence could impact any future civil rights investigation.",
      "Noem, like Patel, said Saturday that DHS is \"conducting this investigation\" and that it is being handled \"just like we do all other officer-involved shootings.\"",
      "She repeatedly said DHS is \"following the exact same protocols that we always have,\" including those used \"under the entire Trump administration and previous administrations,\" and emphasized that \"nothing has changed\" in how the department investigates such incidents.",
      "What video of Pretti's shooting shows",
      "A CBS News visual investigation shows Pretti holding a cellphone in his right hand and nothing in his left before being pushed by an officer. Later footage shows multiple federal agents wrestling him to the ground.",
      "In one sequence, an officer is seen reaching into the struggle empty-handed and stepping away holding a gun, which appears to have been removed from Pretti's waistband. The first shot is fired approximately one second later. In total, roughly 10 shots can be heard.",
      "Noem said Pretti had approached officers with a handgun and reacted violently when agents attempted to disarm him, prompting an agent to fire in self-defense.",
      "But O'Hara said he's seen no evidence that Pretti brandished a weapon, describing him as someone who appeared to be lawfully recording law enforcement activity while legally carrying a firearm.",
      "Court intervention",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison said the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension \u2014 the state agency that investigates use-of-force cases \u2014 was denied access to the crime scene, even after obtaining a judicial warrant.",
      "Ellison said Minnesota sought and obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent the federal government from destroying or altering evidence, including items federal agents removed from the scene.",
      "\"We've never had to do anything like this before,\" Ellison said, calling the situation \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "The BCA later returned to the scene to continue collecting evidence and canvassing the neighborhood, according to state officials.",
      "Some federal agents expected to leave Minneapolis area soon",
      "Bovino and some Border Patrol agents are expected to leave the Minneapolis area soon, three sources familiar with the move tell CBS News. Two DHS officials told CBS News that the department would begin to withdraw some of the 1,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protections agents and officers currently deployed on the ground in the Twin Cities, this week.",
      "One source said Bovino has been relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to Pretti's fatal shooting, which came less than a month after another person in Minneapolis, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by an immigration agent. Bovino suggested over the weekend Pretti had intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials were contradicted by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "Walz has called for the withdrawal of roughly 3,000 federal immigration agents from Minnesota, calling the surge unsafe and destabilizing.",

      "Dec. 1: ICE launches crackdown in Minneapolis area",
      "ICE launched \"Operation Metro Surge\" in the Minneapolis area in the first week of December, the latest in a string of Trump administration immigration crackdowns targeting Democratic communities. CBS News reported at the time that ICE planned to target, in part, those with deportation orders, including Somali immigrants, a population President Trump has harshly criticized.",
      "Minnesota had drawn nationwide attention due to a litany of fraud schemes that allegedly bilked billions of dollars from the state's federally funded public assistance programs. Mr. Trump attacked state officials over the fraud scandals \u2014 and zeroed in on the fact that most of the dozens charged in the schemes were of Somali descent.",
      "The state has the nation's largest Somali American population, the vast majority of them U.S. citizens, either by birth or through naturalization, according to census data.",
      "Dec. 26: Viral video alleges fraud in Minnesota day cares",
      "In a now-viral YouTube video posted the day after Christmas, conservative influencer Nick Shirley visited nearly a dozen day care facilities in the Minneapolis area that he alleged were receiving taxpayer money but not providing any services. The video, which has racked up nearly 4 million views on YouTube, was amplified by Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "State investigators later visited several of the day care centers highlighted in his video, and said nine of them were \"operating as expected.\" Eight of the facilities had children present during the inspection, and a ninth was not yet open for the day, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said. One of the centers closed in early January.",
      "Dec. 29: ICE dispatches agents to visit Minneapolis-area businesses",
      "Days after the Shirley video was posted, agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch were dispatched to conduct site visits to several dozen Minneapolis businesses. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they were overseeing a \"massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.\"",
      "Jan. 5: Thousands of additional federal agents are deployed",
      "Roughly a week after the Shirley video, CBS News first reported that the Trump administration would be deploying an additional 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently called the deployment the largest operation in its history.",
      "The reinforcements included Border Patrol agents, including commander Gregory Bovino, who had previously led sweeping and controversial immigration enforcement operations in Charlotte, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Jan. 7: Renee Good shot and killed by ICE officer",
      "Two days later, an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good while she was behind the wheel of her car, sparking outrage and setting off days of protests.",
      "Videos of the incident appear to show Good's car was approached by multiple ICE officers, one of whom stepped in front of her vehicle. Good backed up, turned her wheel and began to drive her car forward, and the officer in front of the SUV, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots.",
      "Mr. Trump and members of his administration accused Good of intentionally hitting and trying to run over the agent, in what Noem described as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" that left the officer injured. Lawyers representing Good's family have said Good and her partner were observing ICE operations.\u00a0Analysis of video from the scene suggested Good may have been trying to steer away from the officers, not towards them.",

      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office resigned, including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, as the office faced pressure to treat the investigation of Renee Good's shooting as a case of assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case. At least six Justice Department prosecutors, most of them supervisors in the Civil Rights Division, said they were leaving the department soon after they learned there would not be a civil rights investigation into Good's shooting.",
      "An FBI supervisor in the Minneapolis field office's public corruption squad later resigned, too, partly over pressure to \"discontinue\" the investigation of Good's shooting, a source told CBS News.",

      "The protest, which prompted families with children and other congregants to leave the church, was widely condemned by conservatives and the Trump administration, which quickly vowed to launch a criminal investigation. The Justice Department also said it would bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present in the church at the time. Lemon said he was reporting on the protest.",
      "Three people were arrested on federal charges several days after the protest, but a federal magistrate judge refused to sign arrest warrants for five other people, including Lemon,\u00a0sources told CBS News.

      "Images of 56-year-old Thao being led out of his home in handcuffs, wearing only underwear, Crocs and a blanket draped over his shoulders in the snow, provoked anger toward ICE and renewed questions about the agency's tactics. Thao was later released.",
      "DHS described the incident at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders who it said lived at the same address, and alleged Thao matched the description of the suspect. Thao's family has strongly disputed the claim that the suspects lived there.",
      "A day later, two whistleblowers revealed ICE had quietly issued a memo in May 2025 authorizing its officers to forcibly enter people's homes, without a judicial warrant, during operations targeting those with deportation orders. The directive marked a seismic shift from longstanding rules meant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, which has long been interpreted to mean law enforcement can't enter private property without a judge's warrant.",

Videos and photos of the incident \u2014 depicting Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack \u2014 garnered national attention, triggering questions about who the Trump administration was targeting in its mass deportation effort.",
      "Dueling narratives of the incident quickly materialized. Federal officials said ICE targeted the man's father \u2014 not Liam \u2014 and accused him of being in the U.S. illegally. According to their version of events, Liam's father tried to flee ICE and abandoned Liam in a car in the process. After arresting the father, the agency said ICE officers attempted to get Liam's mother to take him but she refused to do so.",
      "People who have spoken to the mother said she was scared to open the door to ICE, fearing she too would get arrested. Advocates and school officials accused ICE of trying to use Liam as bait \u2014 a claim ICE has denied.",
      "Liam and his father are currently being held at a family detention center overseen by ICE in Texas. CBS News reported\u00a0they have pending immigration cases and can't be legally deported for now.",
      "Jan. 24: Alex Pretti fatally shot by Border Patrol agents",
      "Just weeks after Renee Good's shooting, a second person was shot and killed by immigration agents: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who worked as an ICU nurse.",
      "Videos of the incident show Pretti standing in the middle of a Minneapolis street holding up his phone toward immigration agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was wrestled to the ground by a group of agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "Noem alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"reacted violently\" when officers tried to disarm him, forcing the agent to fire \"defensive shots.\" Videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before the shooting, and one video from immediately beforehand, when officers were struggling with Pretti, appears to show an agent reaching into the scrum empty-handed and emerging with a gun. Local police officials have said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the officer, with Bovino accusing Pretti, without citing evidence, of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" during an operation to pursue a man who was in the country illegally and wanted for domestic assault. Local politicians have condemned the shooting, with Walz calling it \"sickening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that even if an investigation ultimately finds the shooting was lawful, it may not matter \"because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "Jan. 24: Bondi makes three demands to \"bring back law and order\"",
      "In a three-page letter, Bondi pressed Walz to let the federal government review Minnesota's voter rolls and welfare data, and to give ICE greater access to jails in the state.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon rejected the request, calling it \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.\"",
      "The Trump administration has long pushed authorities in Minnesota to cooperate more extensively with ICE's requests to detain people and to let federal agents go into detention facilities. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump also called on local law enforcement to assist ICE, urging Walz, Frey and Democratic officials nationwide to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\"",

And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable\" for the city's 600 officers, O'Hara said. \"This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Jan. 26: Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, some agents to leave Minneapolis, sources say",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the Pretti's shooting. Bovino, citing no evidence,\u00a0suggested\u00a0over the weekend that Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials\u00a0were contradicted\u00a0by witnesses and video from the scene.",

    "story": [
      "Soon after Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent, top Trump administration officials made sweeping, categorical statements about the deadly shooting before a full investigation had begun.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said the Border Patrol agent fired \"defensive shots,\" fearing for his life because Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti intended to \"kill\" and \"inflict maximum damage.\" Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said Pretti planned to \"massacre\" federal agents. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin.\"",
      "These statements by senior administration officials, many of which have been directly contradicted by videos of the incident and witness accounts, have caused internal frustration among some at DHS who are increasingly concerned about the agency's reputation, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told CBS News.",
      "One U.S. government official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said top DHS officials were mishandling the public messaging around the deadly incident, making statements that were not supported by concrete evidence, before any investigative findings came out.",
      "\"It's unclear who at DHS thought it would be a good idea to make such claims before any facts were established, but it was a terrible miscalculation,\" the U.S. official said.",
      "A Homeland Security official who works on immigration enforcement expressed concern about the possibility of \"self-inflicted reputational harm\" being caused by the \"strong language\" used by top officials following Pretti's killing.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" the DHS official said, also requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Nobody, including President Trump, wants to see people get shot or hurt.\"",
      "\"That's exactly why Governor Walz and Mayor Frey need to allow local police to work with federal law enforcement to remove illegal alien criminals, murderers, and pedophiles from Minnesota,\" Leavitt added.",
      "The frustrations inside DHS come amid a shift in public opinion toward President Trump's deportation efforts. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that Americans' support for his deportation campaign had fallen to 46%, down from 59% at the start of his administration. The poll also found 61% of those surveyed believe immigration agents are being \"too tough.\"",
      "A former senior Border Patrol official who continues to be in touch with current agency personnel said many still \"believe in the overall effort.\"",
      "\"But what is being done is starting to lose them,\" the former official said, noting the \"initial narrative\" from DHS about the shooting \"undermines our credibility.\"",
      "\"They feel caught in the middle with harmful rhetoric on both sides,\" the former official said.",
      "\"A horrible situation for everyone\"",
      "The shooting of 37-year-old Pretti has further inflamed tensions in Minneapolis, which has been the focus of the deployment of federal agents so far under President Trump's nationwide campaign against illegal immigration. It came less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, another U.S. citizen and Minneapolis resident.",
      "In Good's case, top Trump administration officials also made broad accusations early on, branding her a \"domestic terrorist\" and alleging that she had sought to injure the ICE officer. Lawyers representing Good's family have said the Minneapolis mother and her partner were observing ICE activity.",
      "Videos of the latest shooting show Pretti standing in the middle of a street holding up his phone toward Border Patrol agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was sprayed with a chemical agent before being wrestled to the ground by agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "While DHS alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"violently resisted\" when agents tried to disarm him, videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before he's shot. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "How the incident is being investigated is also raising questions. U.S. officials and FBI Director Kash Patel said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch has taken the lead role investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual. Instead of tasking an outside entity to probe the shooting, they noted, ICE would be tasked with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "As in the Good case, Minnesota state officials have said they've been blocked from accessing evidence needed to investigate Pretti's shooting. Over the weekend, a federal judge barred DHS from altering or destroying evidence of the incident. The judge is holding a hearing on the case later Monday.",
      "A Border Patrol official who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the Trump administration should wait for an investigation before making definitive statements about Pretti's killing, calling the shooting \"a horrible situation for everyone.\"",
      "The official said immigration agents are facing an \"extremely difficult situation\" in the field, citing instances of them getting attacked or obstructed while on the job.",
      "Border Patrol agents, the official argued, have been \"beat up\" by both sides of the political spectrum in recent years. First, by some conservatives, who accused them of being complicit in the crisis at the U.S. southern border under former President Joe Biden and now, by liberals angry over President Trump's deportation crackdown.",

Welch led the group of Democrats who signed the letter.",

      "The administration's decision to focus its follow-up investigation on Good, rather than the shooting, contributed to a wave of resignations by career Justice Department attorneys who opposed the decision, CBS News has learned.",
      "In the letter, sent to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon, Senate Democrats wrote: \"After you informed Division personnel that you would not consider opening an investigation into whether the ICE agent violated federal law, several career prosecutors \u2014 including the head of the Criminal Section, which is responsible for these investigations \u2014 accelerated planned departures from the Division.\"",
      "The letter to Dhillon also said: \"Your decision not to investigate Ms. Good's killing reflects a trend in the Division under your leadership of ignoring the enforcement of civil rights laws in favor of carrying out President Trump's political agenda. This trend, combined with apparent political interference in investigative and prosecutorial decisions, undermines public trust, the legitimacy of our institutions, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Tracee Mergen, the acting FBI supervisor of the Public Corruption Squad in the Minneapolis Field Office, resigned last week in part over the Good investigation, according to multiple sources.

      "Gov. Tim Walz says that he and President Trump shared a \"productive\" phone call Monday morning, during which he says the president agreed to consider a reduction of federal immigration enforcement forces in Minnesota following the second fatal shooting of a resident by federal agents.",
      "I had a productive call with President Trump earlier today. I told him we need impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, and that we need to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota.",
      "A spokesperson for Walz's office said the governor \"made the case that we need impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, and that we need to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota,\" and added that Mr. Trump \"agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.\"",
      "Walz's office also said that Mr. Trump agreed to speak with Department of Homeland Security officials \"about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, on his Truth Social network, posted that Walz \"(requested) to work together with respect to Minnesota.\" He went on to say that he and Walz \"seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" and added \"I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that.\"",
      "Walz's office says the governor also took time to remind Mr. Trump that \"the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen. There is not a single documented case of the department's releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody.\"",
      "The Minnesota Department of Corrections earlier this month disputed a claim made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that the state was not honoring ICE arrest detainers, calling those claims \"categorically false.\"",
      "The call between Mr. Trump and Walz Monday comes just one day after Walz stridently denounced the actions of federal immigration enforcement agents in Minneapolis-St. Paul and throughout greater Minnesota during Operation Metro Surge, and called the president out by name.",
      "\"What's the plan, Donald Trump? What is the plan?\" Walz said in a news conference Sunday. \"What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state? If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation.\"",

    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The threat of a partial government shutdown looms large this week after Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
      "For weeks, lawmakers in both parties and across both chambers have been working to pass individual funding measures before government funding lapses on Friday, Jan. 30.",
      "Six of the 12 appropriations bills have already cleared both chambers and been signed into law. And the Senate was expected this week to take up the remaining six funding measures, which passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together to secure swifter passage through the upper chamber.",
      "The remaining six bills include funding for the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury and other related agencies. And crucially, funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, is part of the six-bill package.",
      "Now, the grouping of those funding measures is creating complications in the Senate, after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents led a slew of Senate Democrats to oppose any funding package that includes DHS. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to advance the package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs if DHS funding is included. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "Even independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who was among a trio of senators who crossed the aisle to negotiate a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year, said he won't vote for a package that includes the DHS measure.",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.\"",
      "Still, King, who caucuses with Democrats, argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",
      "King joined a number of Senate Democrats advocating for the approach. And later Sunday, Schumer signaled Democrats more broadly would be willing to move forward with the other five funding bills.",
      "\"Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,\" Schumer said in a statement, calling it the \"best course of action.\"",
      "In another statement Monday, Schumer put pressure on Senate GOP leaders to move forward with the funding bills without the DHS funds.",
      "\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "But whether the will exists among Senate Republicans to strip out the DHS funding bill from the broader package, which would require unanimous consent, remains to be seen. Heading into the week, GOP Senate leaders were expected to move forward as planned. Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week.",
      "The DHS bill was considered separately from the other funding bills in the House last week after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to ICE, following the first deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis. The measure ultimately picked up support from seven House Democrats.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the DHS funding measure, along with three other measures, last week.",
      "At the time, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriators, characterized the DHS measure as a positive step, while acknowledging that it fell short of the reforms that Democrats had sought. And they argued that neither a continuing resolution to keep the government funded nor a government shutdown would rein in ICE due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, making an alternative strategy in the funding fight futile.",
      "Ultimately, DeLauro voted against the bill that she had negotiated, while Murray has pledged to do the same.",
      "\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said in a post on X pledging to oppose the measure. \"The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate \u2014 Republicans must work with us to do that.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans have spoken out following Saturday's shooting, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" while arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina likewise called for \"thorough and impartial investigation,\" as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said a \"comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work.\" Sens. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Jon Husted of Ohio later joined the calls for an investigation into the incident.",
      "Whether more Republicans follow suit, or go further, remains an open question.",
      "Adding to the difficulties for the Senate this week is a winter storm in Washington. Though the Senate had been set to return Monday for votes, senators are now set to return Tuesday afternoon due to the weather, shortening the already tight timeline to avert a partial shutdown by the week's end.",
      "Should senators be unable to approve additional funding, agencies and programs would begin to shut down after Jan. 30. But the shutdown would differ from the one that stretched through October and into November since some appropriations bills have already passed both chambers and been signed into law.",
      "Funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch passed as part of the deal to reopen the government in November and was signed into law. Funding for the departments of Commerce and Justice; Interior and the EPA as well as energy and water development has also passed both chambers and was signed into law last week, meaning they would continue to operate like usual even as other parts of the government shut down.",

      "The Department of the Treasury said Monday that it is canceling all contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton after a former contractor who worked for the consulting firm leaked tax information belonging to thousands of people, including President Trump.",
      "In 2024, former IRS contractor Charles Edward Littlejohn of Washington, D.C. \u2014 who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton \u2014 was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information about Mr. Trump and others to news outlets.",
      "Littlejohn gave data to The New York Times and ProPublica between 2018 and 2020 in leaks that appeared to be \"unparalleled in the IRS's history,\" prosecutors said.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a new release on Monday that the tax return leak affected roughly 406,000 people, citing IRS data. The agency did not note Littlejohn's release of Mr. Trump's tax info.",
      "\"President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"",
      "A representative from Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment.",
      "In court documents, prosecutors said Littlejohn had applied to work as a contractor specifically to get Mr. Trump's tax returns and figured out how to search and extract tax data to avoid triggering suspicions internally.",
      "\"I made my decision with full knowledge that I would likely end up in a courtroom to answer for my serious crime,\" Littlejohn said at the time of his sentencing in January of 2024. \"I used my skills to systematically violate the privacy of thousands of people.\"",

    "summary": "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations branch is leading the federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, FBI Director Kash Patel said.",
      "HSI will be assisted by the FBI, according to multiple U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is also conducting an internal administrative review through its Office of Professional Responsibility, as per standard practice, the officials said.",
      "Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed by an ICE agent around 9 a.m. local time Saturday in south Minneapolis.",
      "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials, given that HSI is not typically tasked with investigating officer-involved shootings and is not structured or equipped to handle core elements of such cases, including ballistics analysis, forensic processing, firearm examinations, video review and large-scale witness canvassing.",
      "HSI historically has investigated crimes with an international or immigration nexus, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, child exploitation and the theft of stolen artifacts.",
      "Patel said on Fox News, \"All the pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS in HSI, and I don't want to comment on their ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Patel added that investigators are focused on \"mostly scientific evidence,\" including fingerprints, DNA, how many rounds were fired and other physical evidence associated with the firearm.",
      "A former senior ICE and HSI official told CBS News that the approach marks a clear break from prior administrations and long-standing practice. The official said it makes little sense for the Department of Homeland Security to oversee a criminal investigation into a fatal shooting involving its own personnel rather than turning the matter over to an outside entity, describing the current setup as highly irregular.",
      "\"That's not the way it was done before this admin,\" one former senior ICE official told CBS News, calling the Trump administration's move \"not normal.\"",
      "The former official noted HSI agents are criminal investigators, but said a probe into a Border Patrol shooting should be handled by an entity outside of the Department of Homeland Security. Both ICE and Border Patrol are overseen by DHS.",
      "Any potential prosecution would still have to be handled by the Justice Department.",
      "Pretti is the second person killed by federal agents in recent weeks in Minneapolis, after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0on Jan. 7. In both cases, administration officials said the agents were acting in self-defense, but eyewitness accounts and videos appeared to contradict some of their claims.",

A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "\"This is a militia that kills,\" Sala said in an interview with Italian media. \"It's a militia that enters people's homes by signing permits for themselves. \u2026 It's clear that they're not welcome in Milan, there's no doubt about that.\"",
      "\"The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement shared on Tuesday with CBS News, and also shared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. \"As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], ICE's investigative component.\"",
      "The U.S. agencies stressed that HSI has supported the Diplomatic Security Service at previous Olympic Games.",
      "\"At the Olympics, the role of Homeland Security Investigations is strictly supportive \u2014 working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,\" the statement said. \"ICE is not involved in policing or managing security during the Olympics.

      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai is the latest setback for the Trump administration in its efforts to obtain copies of voter registration lists from dozens of states. Earlier this month, a federal judge in California rejected the Justice Department's bid to get sensitive information related to the 23 million voters on its voter rolls, calling it \"unprecedented and illegal.\"",
      "An entry on the docket for the Oregon case indicated that Kasubhai granted the state's request to dismiss the suit and would soon issue a formal opinion detailing his reasoning.",
      "\"The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,\" Oregon Attorney General Day Rayfield said in a statement. \"Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can't be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.\"",
      "The Justice Department sued Oregon in September and sought a court order directing the state to turn over its voter registration list of nearly 3.8 million registered voters, which contains sensitive information including addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.",
      "The lawsuit alleged that Oregon and its secretary of state, Tobias Read, violated federal voting laws by refusing to turn over the unredacted copy of the state's voter rolls.",
      "But in seeking to have the case dismissed, Oregon officials argued that the Justice Department was not legally entitled to the sensitive voter information it was demanding. They also said that federal privacy law prohibits the government from collecting records of conduct protected by the First Amendment.",
      "Kasubhai, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier this month on the state's effort to have the lawsuit dismissed. But he scheduled another proceeding for Monday to discuss a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about immigration enforcement activities in the state.",
      "In the letter, dated Saturday, Bondi urged Walz to cooperate with the Trump administration in three areas to \"bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans.\" One of the steps the attorney general specified was to give the Justice Department access to Minnesota's voter rolls, which she said would \"better guarantee free and fair elections and boost confidence in the rule of law.\"",
      "Kasubhai ordered lawyers with the Justice Department and the state of Oregon to explain the relevance of Bondi's letter in interpreting the \"basis and purpose\" of the demand for the voter registration list.",
      "Since May, the Justice Department has demanded complete voter registration lists from nearly every state and Washington, D.C., according to the Brennan Center for Justice. At least 11 states have either turned over or said they intend to provide the information to the Trump administration.",
      "The Justice Department has sued two dozen states and Washington, D.C., for refusing to hand over the voter information.",
      "The Trump administration has said it needs those records to ensure states maintain accurate voter rolls and remove ineligible voters to prevent the opportunity for fraud in federal elections. But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show the Justice Department is working with the Department of Homeland Security to provide the data so it can be used for criminal and immigration investigations."

The 2020s started with the clock moving to 100 seconds to midnight, with the group saying cyber-enabled information warfare was compounding the threat posed by nuclear war and climate change by undercutting society's ability to respond to either.",
      "The clock stayed in that position for the next two years until 2023, when it was moved to 90 seconds to midnight, largely because of what the group said were the increasing dangers posed by Russia's war in Ukraine. It stayed at that setting in 2024.",

    "summary": "The judge ordered the acting head of ICE to appear in his courtroom on Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt of court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom in-person on Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier order.",
      "Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in a brief three-page order\u00a0that the Trump administration has failed to comply with \"dozens\" of court orders in recent weeks, which has resulted in \"significant hardship\" to immigrants who have been arrested and detained as part of Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz wrote that he has been \"extremely patient\" with administration officials, even though they sent thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally \"without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.\"",
      "\"The court's patience is at an end,\" he wrote.",
      "Schiltz, appointed by President George W. Bush, ordered Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, to appear \"personally\" before the court and \"show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.\" CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment on the judge's action.",
      "\"The court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have tried and failed,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Schiltz's order came in a case involving an Ecuadorian man, Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, who came to the U.S. illegally in 1999 when he was a minor. He was detained earlier this month and placed in immigration custody at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, according to court filings.",
      "Tobay Robles challenged his detention in federal district court, and Schiltz issued an order last week requiring federal immigration authorities to either provide him with a bond hearing within seven days or immediately release him from custody if a hearing was not provided.",
      "Tobay Robles' lawyers informed the court on Friday that his client had not received a bond hearing and was still in immigration custody.",
      "Schiltz wrote in his latest order that Lyons would not be required to appear if Tobay Robles' lawyers and the administration filed papers indicating that the Ecuadorian man had been released from custody.",
      "The Trump administration's enforcement operations in the Twin Cities have left the federal court there inundated with petitions from immigrants challenging their detentions and seeking release. A judge in Minnesota is separately considering a bid by state officials to altogether bring an end to Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz himself tangled with the Trump administration last week after the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit to order the lower court to sign arrest warrants for five people in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a church in St. Paul earlier this month. A unanimous panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit declined the administration's request.",
      "Three people have been charged in connection with the demonstration, but a U.S. magistrate judge declined to issue arrest warrants for the five others, which included former CNN anchor Don Lemon.",
      "The Justice Department sought review of the magistrate judge's finding and then turned to the 8th Circuit after Schiltz, who was assigned the matter, did not \u2014 in the administration's view \u2014 move quickly enough.",
      "In a letter to the 8th Circuit, Schiltz said the Trump administration's efforts were \"unprecedented\" and said \"there is absolutely no emergency.\"",

    "summary": "In a potentially bellwether case, a plaintiff alleges that social media companies deliberately design their platforms to target children.",
    "story": [
      "Jury selection is set to start\u00a0in a trial over whether Meta, TikTok and YouTube fuel excessive social media use by children in ways that harm their mental health.",
      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "Potential bellwether",
      "Legal experts have said the trial could be a bellwether for more than a thousand similar cases brought against social media players in recent years. Depending on the outcome, tech giants could be forced to overhaul their platforms, CBS News Philadelphia reported.",
      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\"Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "Zuckerberg expected to testify",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "Meta, YouTube and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",
      "TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.",

    "summary": "The AAP is recommending immunization against 18 diseases.\u200b Earlier this month, the CDC reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

      "As large parts of the U.S. dig out from\u00a0a major winter storm, health officials are renewing warnings about the serious and potentially deadly\u00a0risks of shoveling snow, which has been linked to\u00a0heart attacks.",
      "\"Snow shoveling is definitely associated with an increased risk of both heart attack and sudden cardiac death, especially in men and those with unknown cardiac coronary heart disease, or with multiple cardiac risk factors,\" said Christopher Kramer, a cardiologist and University of Virginia Health and the president of the American College of Cardiology.",
      "Cardiac risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, family history of heart disease, and tobacco use, as well as a sedentary lifestyle, Kramer told CBS News. He said the reason why shoveling snow can exacerbate them \"is complex,\" involving the type of exercise as well as the environment.",
      "The act of pushing and lifting snow can increase a person's heart rate and blood pressure even more than activities considered especially taxing, like running, said Kramer. And exposure to the cold only compounds the cardiac strain, as low temperatures alone can cause blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to spike, which are risk factors for heart attacks.",
      "\"You have a dual problem, that you're increasing demand for oxygen because of the workload, and you're reducing supply because of the constriction of the blood vessels in the cold,\" Kramer said. \"So, you take someone who's not in shape, who has a lot of risk factors for heart disease, they're not getting regular exercise, and they go out on a very cold day and do what turns out to be one of the most vigorous forms of exercise you can do.\"",
      "A 2020 report by the\u00a0American Heart Association listed shoveling snow among the top physical activities that can place stress on the heart, particularly if a person is not accustomed to exercising. An updated warning from the association last month referenced numerous studies on the dangers of shoveling snow for people with and without heart disease.",
      "\"Shoveling snow places a huge demand and increases the stress on the heart via a rapidly elevated blood pressure and heart rate, generally when our vessels are already vasoconstricted due to the cold,\" said John Osborne, a cardiologist and volunteer of the American Heart Association, in an email. Shoveling for just 10 minutes can elevate a person's heart rate to 97% of its maximal predicted rate, which is the highest number of beats per minute that the heart should ideally reach during exercise.",
      "Three people died while trying to shovel and clear snow in Pennsylvania's Lehigh County during this latest storm,\u00a0CBS News Philadelphia reported, citing the county coroner's office. Their ages ranged from 60 to 84, and all three apparently experienced cardiac-related medical emergencies while shoveling.",
      "The coroner's report said their deaths were ruled natural and consistent with cardiac events that can occur during \"strenuous activity such as snow removal, particularly in older adults of those with underlying health conditions.\"",
      "One of the station's meteorologists, Bill Kelly, urged people in the area to take precautions\u00a0when it comes to clearing their sidewalks or driveways. He noted they were expecting a layer of sleet and freezing rain on top of the snow.",
      "\"If you go out and you shovel that, halfway through, if you shovel often, you're going to get a fresh layer of sleet and ice on the ground,\" Kelly said. \"The good news is, smaller doses of exertion. That's good. But the layer of ice is going to be hard to clean as it gets going.\"",
      "In Minnesota, which also saw significant snowfall and extremely cold temperatures, cardiologist Josh Buckler emphasized the importance of staying safe when it comes to temperature drops, physical exertion and heart health.",
      "\"I tell all my patients: Be cautious with shoveling,\" Buckler told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0before the winter storm arrived. \"There's some really great data that shows that for every 2-degree drop, after about 0 degrees, the heart attack risk goes up by about 2%. And that risk lasts for about 28 days afterwards.\"",
      "A Canadian study published in 2017 found that heavy snowfall of about 8 inches in a particular area corresponded with a 16% increased risk of cardiac-related hospitalizations and a 34% increased risk of death from heart attacks in men.",
      "Kramer said the gender-specific figure could simply be due to the fact that men took on the duty of shoveling most often.",
      "To lower the chances of experiencing a heart attack, he recommends people with cardiac risk factors take breaks while shoveling snow, or better yet, avoid the task altogether.",
      "\"If you have these risk factors, pay the kid down the street to shovel your walk. Don't do it,\" he said. \"If you have to do it, take breaks.\"",

      "\"This mission is broken. It must be terminated,\" Shapiro said on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The administration is facing scrutiny after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, on Saturday, which came weeks after another fatal shooting in Minneapolis by a federal agent.",
      "On Monday, President Trump announced he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee the operation. Meanwhile, despite internal scrunity from the Trump administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to keep her job, CBS News reported Tuesday, while her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the country's interior to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "The Pennsylvania governor said the administration's tone appears to be changing, \"but the tactics haven't.\"",
      "\"I will believe this president when he calls off the mission, when he ends it, when he sends these federal troops home and out of Minnesota and stops wreaking havoc on our communities,\" Shapiro added.",
      "Shapiro on Noem: \"Trump should fire her\"",
      "Asked whether Noem should be impeached, following growing support for the move among House Democrats, Shapiro said \"she was wholly unqualified when she got the job.\"",
      "\"Trump should fire her,\" Shapiro added. \"And if Trump doesn't fire, the Congress should act.\"",
      "But Shapiro said he's most focused on \"whether or not Congress is going to stand up\" to oppose funds for immigration enforcement within the DHS funding measure, which is part of a six-bill package set to move through the Senate this week to avert a partial government shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"Congress needs to step up,\" Shapiro said. \"It's one thing for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and others to begin to show a little bit of spine here and standing up to the president. It's a whole other thing for them to vote to stop funding these kinds of missions. That's the most important vote this week.\"",
      "Shapiro argued that a shutdown wouldn't be necessary, citing some \"bipartisan consensus that the manner in which this deployment in Minnesota has been carried out is wrong and needs to end.\"",
      "\"All the Congress needs to do is pull back on the funding and put specific language in the bill that says you can't fund an operation like what's going on in Minnesota,\" Shapiro said. \"There should be bipartisan consensus for that.\"",
      "Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week. Government funding expires after Friday, Jan. 30.",

    "story": [
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, three sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development, which effectively amounts to a demotion,  follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Bovino, citing no evidence, suggested over the weekend Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials were contradicted by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey earlier Monday. Frey said the president \"agreed that the present situation cannot continue.\"",
      "In recent months, Bovino has been one of the leading public faces of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, gaining notoriety due to his aggressive and outspoken approach for the job and for appearing in the field in tactical gear alongside rank-and-file Border Patrol personnel.",
      "Before arriving in Minneapolis earlier this month, he was dispatched to Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans last year.",
      "His presence in those cities was part of a significant change in tactics by the Trump administration, which has used Border Patrol agents to carry out immigration arrests hundreds of miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. At one point during a Chicago enforcement operation, known as Midway Blitz, Border Patrol had made more arrests than Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is normally responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Over that time, Bovino has drawn criticism from those who view the administration's immigration tactics as overly harsh and its response to protests heavy-handed \u2014 and plaudits from many supporters of the president who view him as a no-nonsense enforcer of his deportation campaign.",
      "He left Chicago in November, a week after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against federal immigration agents over their use of force during Operation Midway Blitz, saying it \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "Soon after Bovino took the helm, agents were seen deploying tear gas on residential neighborhood streets, near schools and against civilians.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sarah Ellis noted that Bovino has personally been involved in using tear gas at protests. And the judge said Bovino \"admitted that he lied\" about the circumstances that led up to one use of tear gas. At one point, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in court every evening at 6 p.m. to brief her about Border Patrol agents' actions.",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources told CBS News.",
      "Bovino has long defended the tactics used by Border Patrol agents, calling them necessary to quell riots that threatened federal law enforcement personnel.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino told CBS News in October.",
      "The White House has also publicly defended Bovino.",
      "\"Mr. Bovino is a wonderful man, and he is a great professional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday, before his departure from Minneapolis was reported. \"He is going to very much continue to lead [Customs and Border Protection] throughout and across the country.\"",

CBS News reported at the time that ICE planned to target, in part, those with deportation orders, including Somali immigrants, a population President Trump has harshly criticized.",
      "Minnesota had drawn nationwide attention due to a litany of fraud schemes that allegedly bilked billions of dollars from the state's federally funded public assistance programs. Mr. Trump attacked state officials over the fraud scandals \u2014 and zeroed in on the fact that most of the dozens charged in the schemes were of Somali descent.",

The video, which has racked up nearly 4 million views on YouTube, was amplified by Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "State investigators later visited several of the day care centers highlighted in his video, and said nine of them were \"operating as expected.\" Eight of the facilities had children present during the inspection, and a ninth was not yet open for the day, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said. One of the centers closed in early January.",

Good backed up, turned her wheel and began to drive her car forward, and the officer in front of the SUV, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots.",
      "Mr. Trump and members of his administration accused Good of intentionally hitting and trying to run over the agent, in what Noem described as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" that left the officer injured. Lawyers representing Good's family have said Good and her partner were observing ICE operations.\u00a0Analysis of video from the scene suggested Good may have been trying to steer away from the officers, not towards them.",

At least six Justice Department prosecutors, most of them supervisors in the Civil Rights Division, said they were leaving the department soon after they learned there would not be a civil rights investigation into Good's shooting.",
      "An FBI supervisor in the Minneapolis field office's public corruption squad later resigned, too, partly over pressure to \"discontinue\" the investigation of Good's shooting, a source told CBS News.",

      "The protest, which prompted families with children and other congregants to leave the church, was widely condemned by conservatives and the Trump administration, which quickly vowed to launch a criminal investigation. The Justice Department also said it would bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present in the church at the time. Lemon said he was reporting on the protest.",
      "Three people were arrested on federal charges several days after the protest, but a federal magistrate judge refused to sign arrest warrants for five other people, including Lemon,\u00a0sources told CBS News.

      "Images of 56-year-old Thao being led out of his home in handcuffs, wearing only underwear, Crocs and a blanket draped over his shoulders in the snow, provoked anger toward ICE and renewed questions about the agency's tactics. Thao was later released.",
      "DHS described the incident at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders who it said lived at the same address, and alleged Thao matched the description of the suspect. Thao's family has strongly disputed the claim that the suspects lived there.",
      "A day later, two whistleblowers revealed ICE had quietly issued a memo in May 2025 authorizing its officers to forcibly enter people's homes, without a judicial warrant, during operations targeting those with deportation orders. The directive marked a seismic shift from longstanding rules meant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, which has long been interpreted to mean law enforcement can't enter private property without a judge's warrant.",

      "On Jan. 20, a team of ICE officers in Minneapolis took into custody a man from Ecuador and his 5-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos. Videos and photos of the incident \u2014 depicting Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack \u2014 garnered national attention, triggering questions about who the Trump administration was targeting in its mass deportation effort.",
      "Dueling narratives of the incident quickly materialized. Federal officials said ICE targeted the man's father \u2014 not Liam \u2014 and accused him of being in the U.S. illegally. According to their version of events, Liam's father tried to flee ICE and abandoned Liam in a car in the process. After arresting the father, the agency said ICE officers attempted to get Liam's mother to take him but she refused to do so.",
      "People who have spoken to the mother said she was scared to open the door to ICE, fearing she too would get arrested. Advocates and school officials accused ICE of trying to use Liam as bait \u2014 a claim ICE has denied.",
      "Liam and his father are currently being held at a family detention center overseen by ICE in Texas. CBS News reported\u00a0they have pending immigration cases and can't be legally deported for now.",

      "Videos of the incident show Pretti standing in the middle of a Minneapolis street holding up his phone toward immigration agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was wrestled to the ground by a group of agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "Noem alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"reacted violently\" when officers tried to disarm him, forcing the agent to fire \"defensive shots.\" Videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before the shooting, and one video from immediately beforehand, when officers were struggling with Pretti, appears to show an agent reaching into the scrum empty-handed and emerging with a gun. Local police officials have said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the officer, with Bovino accusing Pretti, without citing evidence, of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" during an operation to pursue a man who was in the country illegally and wanted for domestic assault. Local politicians have condemned the shooting, with Walz calling it \"sickening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that even if an investigation ultimately finds the shooting was lawful, it may not matter \"because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",

      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon rejected the request, calling it \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.\"",
      "The Trump administration has long pushed authorities in Minnesota to cooperate more extensively with ICE's requests to detain people and to let federal agents go into detention facilities. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump also called on local law enforcement to assist ICE, urging Walz, Frey and Democratic officials nationwide to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\"",
      "Jan. 25:\u00a0 Minneapolis police chief says, \"This is not sustainable\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said \"people have had enough\" and urged leaders to \"come together and figure this out.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks,\" he said in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable\" for the city's 600 officers, O'Hara said. \"This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Jan. 26: Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, some agents to leave Minneapolis, sources say",
      "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the Pretti's shooting. Bovino, citing no evidence,\u00a0suggested\u00a0over the weekend that Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials\u00a0were contradicted\u00a0by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",

      "Canada's last captive whales have received a reprieve from death after the government conditionally approved a plan Monday to export them to the United States.",
      "Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson met Monday with officials from Marineland, the shuttered theme park and zoo in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to talk about its proposed plan to move the animals south. The park is in discussions with four U.S. institutions to take its 30 beluga whales and four dolphins.",
      "\"It was a constructive meeting, and I provided conditional approval for export permits,\" Thompson said in a statement posted on social media Monday. \"I will issue the final permits once final required information is received from Marineland.\"",
      "Marineland pleaded with the minister, telling her repeatedly the park was running out of money. The park had told Thompson the animals would be euthanized if the export permits were not authorized by Jan. 30, according to a letter she wrote to Marineland on Monday, which was obtained by The Canadian Press news agency.",
      "Marineland said in a statement that it has Thompson's support for the relocation of the animals. \"We extend our gratitude to the minister and the Canadian government for prioritizing the lives of these remarkable marine mammals,\" it said.",
      "The move comes after Marineland presented what it called an urgent rescue solution to the federal government last week.",
      "The park is reportedly in discussions with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut and SeaWorld, which has several U.S. locations.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford supported Thompson's decision.",
      "\"They're going to have a better home than where they are because it's a terrible home they're in right now,\" Ford said of the animals. \"It wasn't large enough.\"",
      "Twenty whales \u2014 one killer whale and 19 belugas \u2014 have died at Marineland since 2019, according to an ongoing tally created by The Canadian Press based on internal records and official statements.",
      "In October, Marineland applied for export permits to move its complement of belugas to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, an aquarium in China. Thompson denied those permits, saying she would not subject the whales to a future performing in captivity.",
      "That is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, though Marineland's animals were grandfathered in.",

      "Online prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi accepted bets for expected snowfall in different locales across the U.S. For example, more than $1.2 million was wagered on a market\u00a0at Polymarket, titled \"How many inches of snow in NYC this weekend? (Jan 24-26)\".",
      "Based on bets placed through Monday, the implied consensus snowfall for New York City's total was 11 inches. The official outcome has yet to be determined, and bettors won't cash out \u2014 or notch losses \u2014 until totals for the three days between Jan. 24 and Jan. 26 are released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, according to the market's description on the site.",
      "Polymarket said the market will rely on snowfall data from NOAA's \"New Snow (IN)\" daily figures for the New York\u2013Central Park area.",
      "The most popular wager for the Big Apple was in the 10- to 12-inch range. Shares predicting snowfall within that bracket were trading at 90 cents each Monday morning.",
      "The top bettor had purchased more than 8,100 shares, anticipating this outcome at 61 cents apiece. The same bettor had also wagered more than $1,000 on 12 to 14 inches of snowfall. Both bets remain active, meaning they have not yet been resolved because an outcome has not been determined.",

      "On Kalshi, another online prediction market, bettors wagered a cumulative seven figures on a similar climate-related question: \"Snow in New York City from Jan 24-26?\"",

    "summary": "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility,\" one DHS official said.",
    "story": [
      "Soon after Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent, top Trump administration officials made sweeping, categorical statements about the deadly shooting before a full investigation had begun.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said the Border Patrol agent fired \"defensive shots,\" fearing for his life because Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti intended to \"kill\" and \"inflict maximum damage.\" Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said Pretti planned to \"massacre\" federal agents. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin.\"",
      "These statements by senior administration officials, many of which have been directly contradicted by videos of the incident and witness accounts, have caused internal frustration among some at DHS who are increasingly concerned about the agency's reputation, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told CBS News.",
      "One U.S. government official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said top DHS officials were mishandling the public messaging around the deadly incident, making statements that were not supported by concrete evidence, before any investigative findings came out.",
      "\"It's unclear who at DHS thought it would be a good idea to make such claims before any facts were established, but it was a terrible miscalculation,\" the U.S. official said.",
      "A Homeland Security official who works on immigration enforcement expressed concern about the possibility of \"self-inflicted reputational harm\" being caused by the \"strong language\" used by top officials following Pretti's killing.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" the DHS official said, also requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Nobody, including President Trump, wants to see people get shot or hurt.\"",
      "\"That's exactly why Governor Walz and Mayor Frey need to allow local police to work with federal law enforcement to remove illegal alien criminals, murderers, and pedophiles from Minnesota,\" Leavitt added.",
      "The frustrations inside DHS come amid a shift in public opinion toward President Trump's deportation efforts. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that Americans' support for his deportation campaign had fallen to 46%, down from 59% at the start of his administration. The poll also found 61% of those surveyed believe immigration agents are being \"too tough.\"",
      "A former senior Border Patrol official who continues to be in touch with current agency personnel said many still \"believe in the overall effort.\"",
      "\"But what is being done is starting to lose them,\" the former official said, noting the \"initial narrative\" from DHS about the shooting \"undermines our credibility.\"",
      "\"They feel caught in the middle with harmful rhetoric on both sides,\" the former official said.",
      "\"A horrible situation for everyone\"",
      "The shooting of 37-year-old Pretti has further inflamed tensions in Minneapolis, which has been the focus of the deployment of federal agents so far under President Trump's nationwide campaign against illegal immigration. It came less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, another U.S. citizen and Minneapolis resident.",
      "In Good's case, top Trump administration officials also made broad accusations early on, branding her a \"domestic terrorist\" and alleging that she had sought to injure the ICE officer. Lawyers representing Good's family have said the Minneapolis mother and her partner were observing ICE activity.",
      "Videos of the latest shooting show Pretti standing in the middle of a street holding up his phone toward Border Patrol agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was sprayed with a chemical agent before being wrestled to the ground by agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "While DHS alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"violently resisted\" when agents tried to disarm him, videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before he's shot. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "How the incident is being investigated is also raising questions. U.S. officials and FBI Director Kash Patel said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch has taken the lead role investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual. Instead of tasking an outside entity to probe the shooting, they noted, ICE would be tasked with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "As in the Good case, Minnesota state officials have said they've been blocked from accessing evidence needed to investigate Pretti's shooting. Over the weekend, a federal judge barred DHS from altering or destroying evidence of the incident. The judge is holding a hearing on the case later Monday.",
      "A Border Patrol official who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the Trump administration should wait for an investigation before making definitive statements about Pretti's killing, calling the shooting \"a horrible situation for everyone.\"",
      "The official said immigration agents are facing an \"extremely difficult situation\" in the field, citing instances of them getting attacked or obstructed while on the job.",
      "Border Patrol agents, the official argued, have been \"beat up\" by both sides of the political spectrum in recent years. First, by some conservatives, who accused them of being complicit in the crisis at the U.S. southern border under former President Joe Biden and now, by liberals angry over President Trump's deportation crackdown.",
      "\"We are being politicized and that's not the job we signed up for,\" the Border Patrol official said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans can file their 2025 tax returns with the IRS starting on Monday, Jan. 26, but what many people really want to know is when they can expect their refund.",
      "That depends largely on whether you file electronically \u2014 as 93% of taxpayers did during last year's tax season \u2014 or if you submit a paper return. Because the latter requires IRS employees to process the file, it can take much longer for these filers to get their refund checks.",
      "Some experts also\u00a0warn\u00a0that taxpayers could face customer service issues with the IRS this season, pointing to\u00a0employee cuts at the agency last year and fallout from the federal shutdown, when many workers were furloughed at a time the agency is usually preparing for tax season.",
      "\"Taxpayers might want to lower their expectations and prepare for unanswered phone calls to the IRS and delays in tax refunds, given these ingredients for a problem-prone filing season,\" Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a blog post\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "What is the refund timeframe for electronic tax filers?",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days, according to the IRS. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "On Monday, the IRS said in a statement that it started phasing out paper refund checks late last year. As a result, most taxpayers must provide the tax agency with their bank routing and account numbers to receive their refund through direct deposit.",
      "After you get a notice from the \"Where's My Refund?\" app that the IRS has sent your check, it could take up to five days for the refund to appear in your bank account, the IRS says.",
      "What if I claimed the EITC or ACTC?",
      "Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), refundable tax credits designed for low- to moderate-income working families, may face a longer wait for their refunds.",
      "That's because, by law, the IRS is required to hold these returns longer, giving the agency longer to scan for fraud or misapplied tax credits. About one-third of EITC claims are paid in error because some taxpayers may not understand whether they qualify for it, the IRS says.",
      "People who claimed either the EITC or the ACTC won't get their refund until March 2, at the earliest, the IRS said Monday.",
      "How can I track my refund?",
      "Filers should check the IRS's \"Where's My Refund\" tool to get an update on the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "People who file paper returns will need to wait about four weeks for their status to show up in the \"Where's My Refund\" app, because it takes longer for those filings to get logged by IRS employees compared with automated processing of e-filed returns.",
      "What information do I need for \"Where's My Refund\"?",
      "The IRS says you'll need to provide the following info to use the agency's \"Where's My Refund?\" app:",

      "This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check\u00a0set to increase\u00a0by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis. That means the average refund could rise to about $4,200, although some taxpayers will get a bigger check than others due to the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",

    "story": [
      "The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, spoke out Tuesday amid reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0agents would have a security role during the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, which are set to begin in Milan on Feb. 6.",
      "\"This is a militia that kills,\" Sala said in an interview with Italian media. \"It's a militia that enters people's homes by signing permits for themselves. \u2026 It's clear that they're not welcome in Milan, there's no doubt about that.\"",
      "\"The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement shared on Tuesday with CBS News, and also shared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. \"As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], ICE's investigative component.\"",
      "The U.S. agencies stressed that HSI has supported the Diplomatic Security Service at previous Olympic Games.",
      "\"At the Olympics, the role of Homeland Security Investigations is strictly supportive \u2014 working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,\" the statement said. \"ICE is not involved in policing or managing security during the Olympics. All security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities.\"",
      "Despite his disapproval, Sala wondered aloud during the interview with Italy's RTL Radio 102: \"Could we ever say no to Trump?\"",
      "\"I believe they (ICE) shouldn't come to Italy, because they don't guarantee they're aligned with our democratic security management methods,\" Sala said. \"We can take care of their security ourselves. We don't need ICE.\"",
      "The reports of ICE's planned role in U.S. security operations during the upcoming Winter Olympic Games came after Italian state television aired video on Sunday of ICE agents threatening to break the windows of a vehicle carrying a state TV crew as they reported on the events in Minneapolis, the AP reported.",
      "The\u00a0fatal shooting\u00a0of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, less than three weeks after Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE officer, have put the city at the center of America's dispute over immigration enforcement and the tactics of its federal agencies.",

      "As the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday, experts warned that a flood of \"AI slop\" is threatening efforts to preserve the memory of Nazi crimes and the millions of Jewish people killed during World War II.",
      "Images seen by the AFP news agency include an emaciated and apparently blind man standing in the snow at the Nazi concentration camp Flossenbuerg, and a viral image of a little girl with curly hair on a tricycle falsely presented as a 13-year-old Berliner who died at the Auschwitz extermination camp.",
      "Such content \u2014 whether produced as clickbait for commercial gain or for political motives \u2014 has proliferated over the past year, distorting the history of Nazi Germany's murder of six million European Jews during World War II.",
      "Early examples emerged in the spring of 2025, but by the end of the year, \"AI slop\" on the subject \"was being shown very frequently,\" historian Iris Groschek told AFP.",
      "On some sites, examples of such content were being posted once per minute, said Groschek, who works at Holocaust memorial sites in Hamburg, including the Neuengamme concentration camp.",
      "With the exponential advances in AI, \"the phenomenon is growing,\" Jens-Christian Wagner, director of the foundation that manages the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora memorials, told AFP.",
      "Several Holocaust memorials and commemorative associations this month issued an open letter warning about the rising quantity of this \"entirely fabricated\" content.",
      "Some of them are churned out by content farms that exploit \"the emotional impact of the Holocaust to achieve maximum reach with minimal effort,\" it said.",
      "The picture supposedly from Flossenbuerg camp falls into this category, as it was shown on a page claiming to share, \"true, human stories from the darkest chapters of the past.\"",
      "But the memorials warned that fake content was also being created, \"specifically to dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives.\"",
      "Wagner points, for example, to images of seemingly \"well-fed prisoners, meant to suggest that conditions in concentration camps weren't really that bad.\"",
      "The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center has warned of a \"flood\" of AI-generated content and propaganda \"in which the Holocaust is denied or trivialized, with its victims ridiculed.\"",
      "By distorting history, AI-generated images have \"very concrete consequences for how people perceive the Nazi era,\" said Groschek.",
      "The results of trivializing or denying the Holocaust have been seen in the attitudes of some younger visitors to the camps, particularly from \"rural parts of eastern Germany ... in which far-right thinking has become dominant,\" said Wagner.",
      "In their open letter, the memorials called on social media platforms to \"proactively combat AI content that distorts history\" and to \"exclude accounts that disseminate such content from all monetisation programs.\"",
      "\"The challenge for society as a whole is to develop ethical and historically responsible standards for this technology,\" they said, adding: \"Platform operators have a particular responsibility in this regard.\"",
      "German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer said in a statement to AFP: \"I support the memorials' call to clearly label AI-generated images and remove them when necessary.\"",
      "He said that making money from such imagery should be prevented.",
      "\"This is a matter of respect for the millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazis' reign of terror,\" he said, reminding the platforms that they have obligations under the EU's Digital Services Act.",
      "Groschek said none of the American social media companies had responded to the memorials' letter, including Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "TikTok responded by saying it wanted to exclude the accounts in question from monetization and implement, \"automated verification,\" according to Groschek.",

    "summary": "With all Israeli hostages now recovered from Gaza, there's a push for the Israel-Hamas peace plan to move to phase-two, but that brings its own challenges.",
    "story": [
      "After Israel brought home the remains of its last hostage from Gaza on Monday, attention turned to the next and more challenging phase of its U.S.-brokered peace plan with Hamas, which should include the reopening of Gaza's border crossing with Egypt and the deployment of an international security force to secure the Palestinian enclave.",
      "The remains of Israeli police officer Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, were found in a cemetery in northern Gaza, Israeli officials confirmed Monday.",
      "\"You should see the honor you're receiving here,\" Gvili's father, Itzik, said Tuesday, kissing his son's coffin, which was draped in an Israeli flag. \"The entire police is here with you, the entire army is with you, the entire people. I'm proud of you.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "Netanyahu's office said in a statement Sunday that a \"limited reopening\" of the Rafah crossing was \"conditioned upon the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages.\"",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living and dead, had been a key term of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan's first phase. With the Israeli military confirming that \"all of the abductees have been returned\" on Monday, Hamas said it had met those terms.",
      "Following the recovery of Gvili's body, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem issued a statement confirming the group's \"commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement.\"",
      "He said Hamas would \"continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "The most immediately anticipated next step would be the opening of the Rafah crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt.",
      "An official with the United Nation's children's agency said Monday that there was a backlog of supplies in Egypt ready to move into Gaza whenever the crossing opens to aid traffic.",
      "\"We have supplies positioned,\" said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director. \"We have our great staff doing good work on the ground. We have plans that can be activated immediately if access is granted.\"",
      "The next phase needs to include bringing not only more humanitarian and commercial supplies but also permanent shelter materials and items to repair infrastructure, he added.",
      "On Monday, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \"the full implementation of the ceasefire arrangements in Gaza is absolutely critical.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General urges all parties to move forward in good faith, and without delay with subsequent phases, facilitate sustained and unhindered humanitarian access, including through the Rafah Crossing.\"",
      "Palestinians see the crossing, which has been largely shut since May 2024, as a lifeline to the outside world. Some are optimistic that opening the Rafah crossing will allow travel to and from the enclave, along with the evacuation of people needing medical care.",
      "\"We hope this will close off Israel's pretexts and open the crossing,\" Abdel-Rahman Radwan, a Gaza City resident whose mother has cancer and requires treatment outside Gaza, told the AP.",
      "Ahmed Ruqab, a father who lives with his family of six in a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, called for mediators and the U.S. to pressure Israel to allow more aid.",
      "\"We need to turn this page and restart,\" he said over the phone.",
      "As well as the border opening, the ceasefire's second phase also calls for the deployment an international security force, for Hamas to disarm, for Israeli soldiers to pull further back and for efforts to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, however, Netanyahu said: \"The next phase is disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip. The next phase is not reconstruction.\"",
      "Hamas under pressure to disarm",
      "Speaking Monday, U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity per the rules of a call set up by the White House, said they expect Israel to help both sides move forward into the second phase of the peace plan, and they want Hamas \u2014 a U.S.- and Israeli designated terrorist group that has ruled over Gaza for two decades \u2014to disarm in accordance with the agreement, and they believe that it will.",
      "\"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to,\" said one of the U.S. officials on the call, according to the\u00a0Reuters news agency. \"If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and, candidly, we think we have a very, very good program to disarm.\"",

      "FPA lawyers told the court that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in.

      "Parts of Australia sweltered in record temperatures of close to 122 degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday as the country sweated through a prolonged heat wave even as bitter cold covered much of the U.S.",
      "The rural towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup in Victoria state registered preliminary highs of 120 degrees that if confirmed overnight would top records set on the day in 2009 when 173 people were killed in the state's devastating Black Saturday bushfires.",
      "No casualties were reported from Tuesday's heat wave, but Victoria authorities urged caution as three forest fires burned out of control.",
      "Melbourne, the state's largest city, also came close to its hottest day. Nowhere perhaps was the searing heat more evident than at Melbourne Park, where the usual crowds thronging outside the Australian Open tennis tournament dwindled to a ghost town as temperatures soared.",
      "Inside, organizers enacted extreme heat protocols, forcing closure of the retractable roofs over the main arenas and postponement of matches on the uncovered outer courts. During Tuesday's quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Iva Jovic - the last match played under scorching sun - the players held ice packs to their heads and portable fans to their faces during breaks in play.",
      "Photographers shooting the match were supplied with cushions by organizers to avoid heat-related injuries when they sat down and covered their cameras with towels to prevent the devices malfunctioning in the heat or burning their hands. Fans lined up to stand in front of giant misting fans or sought shelter in air-conditioned areas of the venue.",
      "Crowds at the event, which has registered record-breaking turnout days so far, dropped from 50,000 from Monday's daytime session to 21,000 on Tuesday as people heeded health warnings from officials and stayed home.",
      "Temperatures were expected to drop Wednesday, although the heat wave was due to linger until the weekend. The heat wave followed another earlier this month amid one of Australia's hottest summers ever.",
      "On Monday, parts of New South Wales and South Australia states hit record temperatures, some exceeding records set during a destructive summer of forest fires in 2019. At that time as now, temperatures approached 122 degrees in some places.",

      "The blunder in the Supreme Court of Victoria state is another in a litany of mishaps AI has caused in justice systems around the world.",
      "Defense lawyer Rishi Nathwani, who holds the prestigious legal title of King's Counsel, took \"full responsibility\" for filing incorrect information in submissions in the case of a teenager charged with murder, according to court documents seen by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry and embarrassed for what occurred,\" Nathwani told Justice James Elliott on Wednesday, on behalf of the defense team.",
      "The errors caused a 24-hour delay in resolving a case that Elliott had hoped to conclude on Wednesday. Elliott ruled on Thursday that Nathwani's client, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was not guilty of murder because of mental impairment.",
      "\"At the risk of understatement, the manner in which these events have unfolded is unsatisfactory,\" Elliott told lawyers on Thursday.",
      "\"The ability of the court to rely upon the accuracy of submissions made by counsel is fundamental to the due administration of justice,\" Elliott added.",
      "The fake submissions included fabricated quotes from a speech to the state legislature and nonexistent case citations purportedly from the Supreme Court.",
      "The AI-generated errors were discovered by the Elliot's associates, who couldn't find the cases cited and requested that defense lawyers provide copies, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation previously\u00a0reported.",
      "The lawyers admitted the citations \"do not exist\" and that the submission contained \"fictitious quotes,\" court documents say.",
      "The lawyers explained they checked that the initial citations were accurate and wrongly assumed the others would also be correct.",
      "The submissions were also sent to prosecutor Daniel Porceddu, who didn't check their accuracy.",
      "The judge noted that the Supreme Court released guidelines last year for how lawyers use AI.",
      "\"It is not acceptable for artificial intelligence to be used unless the product of that use is independently and thoroughly verified,\" Elliott said.",
      "The court documents do not identify the generative artificial intelligence system used by the lawyers.",
      "In a comparable case in the United States in 2023, a federal judge imposed $5,000 fines on two lawyers and a law firm after\u00a0ChatGPT was blamed for their submission of fictitious legal research in an aviation injury claim.",
      "Judge P. Kevin Castel said they acted in bad faith. But he credited their apologies and remedial steps taken in explaining why harsher sanctions were not necessary to ensure they or others won't again let artificial intelligence tools prompt them to produce fake legal history in their arguments.",
      "Later that year, more fictitious court rulings invented by AI were cited in legal papers\u00a0filed by lawyers for Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Cohen took the blame, saying he didn't realize that the Google tool he was using for legal research was also capable of so-called AI hallucinations.",
      "British High Court Justice Victoria Sharp warned in June that providing false material as if it were genuine could be considered contempt of court or, in the \"most egregious cases,\" perverting the course of justice, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "The use of artificial intelligence has made its way into U.S. courtrooms in other ways. In April 2025, a man named Jerome Dewald appeared before a New York court and submitted a\u00a0video\u00a0that featured an\u00a0AI-generated avatar\u00a0to deliver an argument on his behalf.",
      "A month after that, a man who was killed in a road rage incident in Arizona \"spoke\" during his killer's sentencing hearing\u00a0after his family used artificial intelligence to create a video of him reading a victim impact statement.",

The park is in discussions with four U.S. institutions to take its 30 beluga whales and four dolphins.",
      "\"It was a constructive meeting, and I provided conditional approval for export permits,\" Thompson said in a statement posted on social media Monday. \"I will issue the final permits once final required information is received from Marineland.\"",
      "Marineland pleaded with the minister, telling her repeatedly the park was running out of money. The park had told Thompson the animals would be euthanized if the export permits were not authorized by Jan. 30, according to a letter she wrote to Marineland on Monday, which was obtained by The Canadian Press news agency.",
      "Marineland said in a statement that it has Thompson's support for the relocation of the animals. \"We extend our gratitude to the minister and the Canadian government for prioritizing the lives of these remarkable marine mammals,\" it said.",
      "The move comes after Marineland presented what it called an urgent rescue solution to the federal government last week.",
      "The park is reportedly in discussions with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut and SeaWorld, which has several U.S. locations.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford supported Thompson's decision.",
      "\"They're going to have a better home than where they are because it's a terrible home they're in right now,\" Ford said of the animals. \"It wasn't large enough.\"",
      "Twenty whales \u2014 one killer whale and 19 belugas \u2014 have died at Marineland since 2019, according to an ongoing tally created by The Canadian Press based on internal records and official statements.",
      "In October, Marineland applied for export permits to move its complement of belugas to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, an aquarium in China. Thompson denied those permits, saying she would not subject the whales to a future performing in captivity.",

      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-dennis-coyle-afghanistan-detention-1-year/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "summary": "Israel's military says the remains of Ran Gvili, the last person whose body was taken hostage into Gaza, have been recovered.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Monday that the remains of the last hostage in Gaza had been recovered, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that stopped the Israel-Hamas war. The announcement came a day after Israel's government said the military was conducting a \"large-scale operation\" in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate the remains of Ran Gvili.",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, and Gvili's family had urged Israel's government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said representatives had informed Gvili's family \"that their loved one has been identified and is being buried.\"",
      "\"With this, all of the abductees have been returned from the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israel and Hamas have been under pressure from ceasefire mediators, including the Trump administration, to move into the second phase of the U.S.-brokered truce, which took effect on Oct. 10.",
      "Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas had said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili's remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.",
      "Both sides have accused the other of violations of the ceasefire since it came into effect, and dozens of Palestinians have been killed since October, including three journalists killed in an Israeli strike\u00a0last week, one of whom had worked extensively for CBS News.",
      "Israel's military said of that attack, as it has other deadly instances during the ceasefire, that it was investigating, but claimed its forces had struck suspects who posed a threat to the safety of troops.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the recovery of Gvili's body, \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement. Hamas will continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "Israel's military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili's remains was \"in the area of the Yellow Line,\" which has divided the territory since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "The ceasefire deal aims to wind down the war that was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 people were killed in the territory during the war, a figure which CBS News cannot independently verify and which Israel disputes, though the United Nations considers it the most accurate death toll estimate available.",
      "Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as \"Rani,\" was killed while fighting Hamas militants during the attack.",
      "Before Gvili's remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel during the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.",
      "The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan calls for creating an international stabilization force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.",
      "President Trump has warned repeatedly that if Hamas refuses to disarm in line with the agreement, \"there will be hell to pay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has launched his new international Board of Peace initiative, inviting dozens of nations to join his administration on a vaguely defined mission to end conflicts in the Middle East, and suggesting ambitions beyond the region.",
      "While the Board of Peace was often mentioned by Mr. Trump as an entity that would focus on rebuilding the decimated Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory is was not mentioned explicitly in the board's founding charter, signed by Mr. Trump and about 20 other national leaders during the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.",

      "Video of the incident posted by SBS Sport showed Vine and other cyclists on the ground as the kangaroo hops across the road, trying to avoid a throng of competitors. One social media commenter called it \"the most Australian crash I've ever seen.\"",
      "Three riders \u2014 Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese \u2014 were forced to quit the race and the kangaroo also was injured.",
      "Vine led the race by 1 minute, 3 seconds on general classification entering the last stage.

      "Juan Sebastian Molano also abandoned the tour Sunday because of fatigue, leaving Vine with only two teammates on the last stage: Ivo Emanuel Oliveira and Briton Adam Yates.",

      "He remained near the front of the peloton for the rest of the stage and finished 1 minute, 3 seconds ahead of Mauro Schmid of Switzerland (Team Jayco Alula) and Harry Sweeny (EF Education - Easypost) of Australia, who was a further nine seconds behind.",
      "\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" said Vine, who won his home race for the second time in three years. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.",

    "summary": "A passenger ferry carrying more than 350 people capsized near the island province of Basilan in the southern Philippines, but most were rescued.",
    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 A ferry with more than 350 people on board sank early Monday near an island in the southern Philippines, killing at least 18 people, officials said. Rescuers saved hundreds more, while a fleet of coast guard and naval ships searched for those still missing.",
      "Coast guard officials said the cargo and passenger ferry apparently encountered technical problems and sank after midnight. The steel-hulled vessel abruptly tilted to one side and took on water, hurling people into the sea in the darkness, according to a rescued passenger who lost his 6-month-old baby.",
      "\"My wife lost hold of our baby and all of us got separated at sea,\" a distraught Mohamad Khan told a volunteer rescuer, Gamar Alih, who posted a video of Khan's remarks on Facebook.",

It sank about a nautical mile from the island village of Baluk-baluk in Basilan province, coast guard Commander Romel Dua told The Associated Press.",
      "\"There were two coast guard safety officers on board and they were the first to call and alert us to deploy rescue vessels,\" Dua said, adding that the two safety marshals survived.",
      "Rescuers saved at least 316 passengers and crewmembers retrieved 18 bodies, officials said. Coast guard and navy ships, along with a surveillance plane, an air force Black Hawk helicopter and fleets of fishing boats carried out search and rescue operations for about two dozen people believed missing off Basilan, Dua said.",
      "The cause of the ferry sinking was not immediately clear and there will be an investigation, Dua said. The coast guard had cleared the ferry before it left the Zamboanga port, and there was no sign of overloading, he said.",
      "Local media reported that up to 15 passengers on the ship's manifest decided not to board at the last minute and refunded their fare. If confirmed, that would reduce the number of missing, Dua said.",
      "Alih, a village councilor from Zamboanga city, told The AP Press that he volunteered to help in the search and rescue because some of his relatives were among the ferry passengers. They all survived.",
      "Basilan Governor Mujiv Hataman said several passengers and two bodies were brought to Isabela, the provincial capital, where he and ambulance vans waited.",

    "summary": "Alex Honnold also famously climbed Yosemite's El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear in 2017.",
    "story": [
      "Climber Alex Honnold has completed a free solo ascent of Taipei 101 in Taiwan, not using any ropes to scale the massive 1,667-foot skyscraper \u2014 and he did it live, as the world watched on with bated breath and hearts racing.",
      "It took Honnold 1 hour and 31 minutes to climb the 101-floor tower and spire on Sunday. The event was livestreamed on Netflix.",
      "\"It's windy,\" Honnold said at the top before taking a selfie. \"I'm so psyched ... And you know what, pretty tired actually.\"",
      "Honnold's climb was originally slated for the previous day, Jan. 23, but was postponed due to bad weather, Netflix said. \"I suppose climbing is always at the mercy of nature, that's just how it goes,\" Honnold said in a\u00a0video posted on social media.",
      "Ahead of the climb, Honnold told Netflix's Tudum fan site he expected viewers to \"probably be on edge watching this,\" but that he hoped they \"get a little bit of my joy from the experience \u2014 that they can appreciate the fun of it and the beauty of it, the scenery, just the whole experience.\"",
      "Taipei 101 is one of the\u00a0tallest skyscrapers in the world. The building was designed by C.Y. Lee & Partners and opened in 2004. It's home to observatories, restaurants, a shopping mall and offices, as well as the Taiwan Stock Exchange.",
      "Frenchman Alain Robert scaled the tower as part of its opening. Robert used ropes, and it took him more than four hours, Honnold told Tudum. \"I think, if I do this, it'll be the biggest urban free solo ever,\" he added.",
      "Honnold also famously climbed El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear in June 2017. El Capitan is a roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall \u2014 more than twice the height of the Empire State Building \u2014 in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California. His incredible feat was captured in the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "That free solo up the Freerider route took Honnold 3 hours and 56 minutes. The following year, Honnold and fellow climber Tommy Caldwell climbed El Capitan's Nose route in 1 hour, 58 minutes and 7 seconds, shattering the previous speed record and breaking the two-hour barrier.",
      "In a \"Note to Self\" on \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018, Honnold reflected on what it took to climb El Capitan without any ropes, telling his 18-year-old self: \"Right now, you're afraid of so many things: strangers, girls, vegetables, falling to your death. That's fine; fear is a perfectly natural part of life. You will always feel fear.\"",
      "\"But over time you will realize that the only way to truly manage your fears is to broaden your comfort zone,\" he said. \"It's a long, slow process that requires constantly pushing yourself, but eventually you'll feel pretty darn good, and you'll climb big walls just like this.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans. Good morning to you.",
      "HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STEVE SCALISE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself. You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours, and your fellow Louisianan Senator Bill Cassidy said the events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job. They're- look we are all, just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago. They have chaos, it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You don't- don't see these numbers either?-- .",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- and so, I wish yesterday didn't happen. What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though, when we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans. I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis, and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin. And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leader's fault. But at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so he- was made a decision not to assist ICE-- .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He was talking- he was talking to- dealing with the federal issues. Because when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76%, homicides down 67%, burglary down 39% year-to-date, sex offenses down, robberies down, motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response- the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, but remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down, and we're seeing that across the country. ICE- look again, anytime something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret. The law says you can't be here illegally and if you're committing violent crimes. The President made it clear, in fact, he was elected. President Trump was elected to get rid of criminals in our communities. 416,000 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because undoubtedly, the President was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it. But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe, almost two thirds of Americans say they dislike the President's approach to his deportation program. There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community? Yes or no? What do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out. In fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment. When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign.\" Do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a concealed carry permit. It's worked very well there. I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime and interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities. You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting, that they were unlawful. Yes, he actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents. Throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah, he wasn't talking about the victim --",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- So, let's tone this down. And-and leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric. I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz said they're Gestapo. He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota, offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things, among them giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs. What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor, but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistle blowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota, and these are stealing programs from learning centers, from disabled students, programs that are being stolen, and the Governor did nothing about it. Congress is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But voter registration logs?--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- Investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand- hand over voter registration logs like, what's the purpose of that to end ICE enforcement?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know- I know we're trying in Congress to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standard, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show a picture ID. Those are things we're pushing for that's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-citizens cannot vote. But I want to ask you ICE- about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said his officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Let's keep in mind that the five year old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --the family--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --protected the child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum, that's- they don't like the app he used to file for asylum.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rescuing-marc-chagall-from-the-nazis/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:17:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Those who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust have been called the Righteous Among the Nations. One such rescuer, an American, was Varian Fry, who helped organize artist Marc Chagall's escape from France, for both him and his paintings.",
    "story": [
      "Marc Chagall once commented if he wasn't Jewish, he might not have been an artist. His faith profoundly influenced his works like \"The Praying Jew,\" for example, as well as a never-before-seen work that Chagall gave to his granddaughter, Bella Meyer.",
      "\"He tells the story of Shabbat, from back of his memories,\" Meyer said of the drawing.",
      "She recalled watching her grandfather work: \"I watched him paint, and I loved it. I adored him.\"",
      "But her grandfather's faith also got him in trouble. In Russia where he was born, Chagall was jailed for not having his Jewish residency papers. He later moved to Paris. \"France, for him, meant freedom,\" said Meyer \u2013 freedom, that is, until the Nazis marched into Paris in 1940.",
      "\"For him he was French, rather than Jew,\" Meyer said.",
      "The Nazis didn't see it that way. They considered Chagall's work \"degenerate art.\" In 1941, the Vichy police tracked him down in Marseilles in the south of France and detained him yet again. Had it not been for the courage of strangers \u2013 non-Jews mostly, who risked their own lives to help smuggle him and his paintings to safety \u2013 that might have been the last we ever heard about Marc Chagall.",
      "Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, has a name for such rescuers: The Righteous Among the Nations. There weren't that many righteous rescuers, however; it's easier to discount horror with blind eyes than it is with eyes wide open. Compared to six million murdered Jews, there are fewer than 30,000 non-Jews who have been recognized for helping.",
      "Using taped and transcribed interviews from the U.S. Holocaust Museum, filmmaker Nick Davis brought 45 extraordinary stories of those non-Jews who did help to life.",
      "\"One of them said, you know, he didn't care whether they were Jewish or Catholic or Eskimos; they were persecuted people, and you had to help,\" Davis said.",
      "His film is called \"This Ordinary Thing.\"",
      "\"We have paid enough attention to the bad guys \u2013 Hitler, Himmler, G\u00f6ring \u2013 and we don't think as much about the good people who helped.\" \u2013 Tina Strobos, The Netherlands",
      "\"On a sort of superficial level, I felt like, 'Ugh, haven't we seen enough Holocaust films?'\" Davis said. \"But when I looked at the stories that we were going to be telling, real goodness is what you do when no one's looking.\"",
      "Oscar-winner Hellen Mirren voices the sacrifices of Irene Gut Opdyke, of Poland, who was forced to become the mistress of an elderly SS officer to buy his silence after he discovered that she was hiding Jews in his villa.",
      "\"I won't tell you it was easy. Not only because he was an old man, but I knew there were 12 lives depending on me \u2026 I never talked about what I did during the war. And I still wouldn't, had I not read that article in the newspaper that said the Holocaust didn't happen.\" \u2013 Irene Gut Opdyke",
      "Alex and Mela Roslan sheltered three Jewish brothers in Warsaw. They couldn't call a doctor if things were bad for fear of being discovered. What happened with them, and far too many others, is dramatized by Jeremy Irons:",
      "\"He says, 'I would feel better if you held me.' I picked him up, and he died in my arms. We buried him in the basement sitting up, because someone told me that was the way to bury a Jew. \" \u2013 Alex Roslan, Poland",
      "Dwork believes whatever the motivation of rescuers was, in the case of the Holocaust, the end often justified the means.",
      "I asked, \"So, there really isn't necessarily a line that connects them all, other than the fact that they must've had good souls?\"",
      "\"Sometimes they didn't even have good souls!\" said Dwork. \"Sometimes greed motivated them. And I say three cheers for greed, because it was thanks to the greed that they put their lives at risk, or put themselves in harm's way.\"",
      "Her latest book, \"Saints and Liars: The Story of Americans Who Saved Refugees from the Nazis\" (W.W. Norton), is about American relief workers who helped save Jewish refugees. Most of the Americans you've likely never heard of. \"Think about it: The best known of the Americans is Varian Fry, and very few people know about him,\" she said.",
      "Varian Fry brings us full circle, for he was the man who helped organize Marc Chagall's escape from France. He was the first American to be given the title of The Righteous Among the Nations. His son, James, accepted the honor on his dad's behalf.",
      "Asked why he thinks his father wasn't recognized more, James Fry replied, \"I think the country wanted to move on, and focus on rebuilding, getting life back to normal. People didn't want to remember, I guess.\"",
      "Varian Fry rarely talked about his time during the war, although Chagall paintings sometimes mysteriously appeared in the Fry household, presumably as a thank-you.",
      "In retrospect, James says his dad suffered from outsized bouts of righteous indignation, to the point he believes his dad's bravery may have sprung in part from his being bi-polar. \"I think he harnessed sort of his manic energy to do something that most people would've thought not worth trying,\" he said.",
      "And it's that \u2013 the not worth trying part \u2013 that haunts any discussion of these Righteous Among the Nations. What would you do?",
      "Nick Davis said, \"I have a wife and two amazing daughters, and I don't know that I would risk their lives for a perfect stranger. Let me correct that: I know I wouldn't risk their lives for a perfect stranger.\"",
      "Bella Meyer said, \"I wish I would have the courage to do even a little ounce of it.\"",
      "We'll never know how many there were \u2013 those hiding Jews in attics or basements or crawlspaces rarely survived their generosity. But those who did, did more than save a life; they created opportunities for life, and art, and beauty for years to come.",
      "Asked what she would say to Varian Fry if she could have a conversation with him now, Chagall's granddaughter replied, \"I would just hug him, and thank him for existing.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-trumps-designs-on-greenland-are-testing-the-u-s-denmark-alliance/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:37:37 -0500",
    "summary": "President's Trump's designs on acquiring the world's largest island \"one way or the other\" have stirred feelings of betrayal among Danes and Greenlanders. Mo Rocca gives us a history lesson about an island that is 80 percent covered in ice.",
    "story": [
      "This past week Greenland was big in the news. Of course, Greenland has always been big. Three times the size of Texas, the world's largest island dominates the arctic space between North America and Europe. Its name notwithstanding, 80 percent of Greenland is covered in ice.",
      "The name Greenland came about as a case of branding, according to Robert Christian Thomsen, a professor of social sciences at Aalborg University in Denmark. Greenland got its name, he says, from Erik the Red, a Viking who came from Iceland and settled there around 985 A.D. Upon returning to Iceland, \"He told the old Norse that lived there, 'There's a magnificent green land to the west of here. You should go, you should come and join us,'\" Thomsen said.",
      "In 1814, Greenland officially became part of the Kingdom of Denmark. So, why all the attention to this mostly desolate landscape?",
      "First, there's security: \"If you look at a map, you'll see that the shortest distance for a missile to travel between Moscow and Washington is immediately over the North Pole and Greenland,\" Thomsen said.",
      "And climate change has made Greenland even more coveted \u2013 more navigable for commercial and military vessels, and easier for mining its rich resources.",
      "\"The receding ice means that there's much more, much better access to oil, to gas, to minerals, including the rare earth elements that are needed for our computers, for our electric cars, for batteries,\" Thomsen said.",
      "American interest in Greenland isn't new. During the 19th century, around the time we bought Alaska from Russia, the U.S. expressed interest in acquiring Greenland. Nothing materialized.",
      "But in 1917 the U.S. did buy territory from Denmark: the three islands in the Caribbean that are today's U.S. Virgin Islands. In return, the United States recognized Danish sovereignty over Greenland.",
      "Then came World War II.",
      "Thomsen said the island was tremendously important to the Allies during the war: \"Denmark is already occupied by the Germans. And so, Greenland is sort of floating out there unprotected. The American administration said, 'We need to occupy Greenland to make sure that the Germans do not do it.'\"",
      "The Allies used the island as a refueling hub for military bombers. After the war, in 1951, the U.S. and Denmark agreed to a more permanent arrangement which, Thomsen said, states that \"The U.S. pretty much has free access [to Greenland]. It can do whatever it wants in terms of establishing military bases, radar, you name it. The U.S. just has to ask politely.\"",
      "But enough about its location and resources. Greenland of course also has people \u2013 a tiny population of about 57,000.",
      "Tillie Martinussen, a native Greenlander and former member of parliament, said growing up in Greenland was wonderful: \"I mean, it's a very, very safe country to grow up in. We're frolicking about in the snow.\"",
      "Martinussen, like almost 90% of the population, is of Inuit descent. Asked what Greenlandic values are, she replied, \"They are we have to take care of each other. We have to stand together. \u00a0Very much community-driven, as opposed to most of the Western countries, which are a lot individually-driven. We live in a society where only two generations ago we're used to people going out hunting to get their food, and we are used to sharing. It's kind of still a state of mind.\"",
      "While polls show most Greenlanders don't want to be American, Martinussen says it's nothing personal: \"I actually love the United States; I love the American people,\" she said. \"Don't get me wrong at all. I mean, one of my dreams was actually going from east to west there in a car.\"",
      "But after President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on Greenland and longtime ally Denmark [\"One way or the other, we're gonna have Greenland\"], that love is being sorely tested.",
      "Martinussen said, \"We have been good allies for 80 years, which makes this treachery feeling so strong in us right now. Children that we have now are going to grow up and being afraid of the United States as the aggressor that we remember.\"",
      "Thomsen said, \"There is a sense, I think, of betrayal. I grew up with \u2013 and most Danes I think grew up with \u2013 the notion that the U.S. is our best friend in the world, you know? So to, all of a sudden, realize that the bad guy, the one who wants to take something away from us and to hurt this state and these people, is not the Russians, is not China, but our best friend.\"",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to fast-track a ban on social media for teenagers under 15.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants his government to fast-track the legal process to ensure that a ban on social media for children under the age of 15 can enter into force in September at the start of the next school year.",
      "In a video released late Saturday by French broadcaster BFM-TV, Macron said he had asked his government to initiate an accelerated procedure so that the proposed legislation can move as quickly as possible and be passed by the Senate in time.",
      "\"The brains of our children and our teenagers are not for sale,\" Macron said. \"The emotions of our children and our teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated. Neither by American platforms, nor by Chinese algorithms.\"",
      "Macron's announcement came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",
      "According to France's health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "Macron's office told The Associated Press that the video was addressed to lawmaker Laure Miller, who is sponsoring the bill that will be examined in a public session on Monday.",
      "\"We are banning social media for under-15s, and we are going to ban mobile phones in our high schools,\" Macron said. \"I believe this is a clear rule. Clear for our teenagers, clear for families, clear for teachers, and we are moving forward.\"",
      "Australia recently implemented the world's first social media ban for teens younger than 16, with its government urging Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, X and Youtube to take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders from their platforms if they don't meet the age requirement. Since then, social media companies have blocked access to about 4.7 million Australian accounts that were identified as belonging to kids under 16, officials said.",
      "The law in Australia provoked fraught debates about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health. It has also prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Peter Malinauskas, the premiere of the state of South Australia, previously told CBS News that officials from North America, Europe and Asia had spoken with him about pushing forward similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is poised to become the second country to institute a social media ban for kids under 16 this year.",

      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "In her new memoir, \"Strangers: A Memoir of Marriage,\" Burden writes in detail about the prenup her lawyer advised against, how her former husband threatened to only give her the bare minimum in child support after giving up custody of their children and how she managed to navigate the painful ordeal while adjusting to her new normal.",
      "As the daughter of Carter Burden, a descendant of the Vanderbilts who built his own broadcasting company, and Amanda Burden, an urban planner who was the daughter of socialite Babe Paley, Belle was independently wealthy when she met Henry Davis, the man she would marry.",

      "Belle Burden and Henry Davis married in 1999, leaving her after an affair in 2020. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "Davis, who Burden refers to in her book as \"James,\" wasn't in a similar position. He was a lawyer at the time, as was Burden, and his family did have money when he was growing up, but, she wrote, \"At some point in the 1970s, his father had a breakdown, was laid off, and stopped working.\"",
      "His parents used savings to cover costs, and when he was in law school, they divorced, and he learned there was no money left. \u00a0Burden said there was one part of the story she never heard fully about his father abandoning the family for a time, \"maybe after an affair,\" before coming back for a number of years before his mother filed for divorce.",
      "While she could never figure out the details, she said the matter of his father and the family's financial struggles stuck with him.",
      "\"He told me how much he wanted to be a husband and father,\" Burden said. \"He told me how much he wanted an honorable life.\"",
      "Three months after their first kiss, he proposed, and, during their engagement, they rented an apartment together and split costs equally. A few months before their 1999 wedding, Burden's mother reminded her she needed to get a prenup written up, something both she and her brother had contractually agreed to in their early 20s.",
      "\"All of my assets were in trust, entirely protected in case of divorce, whether we had a prenup or not. I didn\u2019t think I needed it. But I had committed to having one,\" she wrote.",
      "In the original draft her family lawyer sent, she and James would each keep the assets they brought into the marriage but would split everything earned during the course of the marriage in case of divorce. She recalled James being \"upset\" by the idea, telling her it made him feel \"like an outsider, a threat,\" and she felt guilty for asking him to sign it.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Belle Burden's book was released earlier this month. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "Just weeks before the wedding, the pressure to sign the prenup increased, and James suggested to her that they tweak the agreement so that anything earned during the marriage would not be split if they divorced, but that anything in both of their names would. With him at her side, she called her lawyer, Tom.",
      "\"Tom told me it was a bad idea; it was standard to share in what was earned during a marriage, both by James and by me,\" she wrote. She insisted on doing it James' way, and finally Tom agreed. She never told her family about the change to the standard prenuptial agreement, worried they would \"intervene.\"",
      "In 2001, they bought a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, something that was \"much bigger\" than she thought they needed, but that James loved. She emptied one of her two trusts to purchase it and listed James as a joint owner, \"even though he had not contributed to the purchase.\" She said she was happy to do it.",
      "A few years later, she used her second trust to purchase a summer home in Martha's Vineyard. James had gone to look at it alone, and he'd loved it, so she wired him the funds from the trust, emptying it completely, and, as with the apartment, she made sure James was listed as a joint owner of the property.",
      "In 2002, they welcomed their first child, with their second and third coming in 2004 and 2007. Burden wrote that James was excited about each and involved with her pregnancies, but after their second child was born, he was promoted to president at his investment firm and began pulling away from daily parenting duties.",
      "Burden shares three children with her ex-husband. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "\"We had made an unspoken bargain: he would work all the time and I would take care of the kids all the time,\" she explained. \"I resented this sometimes, usually when I was stressed, when one of the kids was sick, or when they were melting down over something. But most of the time, I liked his fervent commitment to his work.\"",
      "As her children got older, she began taking on some pro bono immigration cases but never went back to paid work. She did receive a job offer in 2012, but James dismissed it immediately when she brought it up, telling her she needed to be available for the kids. At first, she recalled being upset that he didn't even discuss it with her, but the feeling passed quickly, believing he was right, that the family \"needed to prioritize James' career.\" She turned down the offer.",
      "Burden said, as the years went by, she and James discussed getting rid of their prenup \"since it was no longer fair\" to her. She'd used her trusts to purchase their homes, and his career had flourished while she gave hers up to raise their children.",
      "In July 2019, they had a meeting scheduled with their lawyer to do just that, but James suggested just before the meeting that they \"table\" the prenup issue and focus on their wills, telling her that he wanted to leave everything to her directly instead of in trusts for their three children.",

When she confronted James, he admitted everything, and the next morning, he told her he wanted a divorce.",
      "He left the home without saying goodbye to the children. Her son, who was 17 at the time, was staying on Long Island with friends, but their daughters, who were 15 and 12, were sleeping when he left.",
      "In a phone conversation later that day, she said he told her, \"I thought I was happy, but I\u2019m not. I thought I wanted our life, but I don\u2019t\" and \"I feel like a switch has flipped. I\u2019m done.\"",

      "It wasn't until January 2021, when, as part of the divorce proceedings, Burden received documents detailing James' earnings over the years, that she realized just how much wealth her soon-to-be ex-husband had accrued over the years. She also realized how their altered prenup, the one she wanted against her lawyer's advice, put her at a disadvantage.",

Her stepmother, Susan, warned her that James might get \"angry\" over the counterclaim, and Burden admitted that \"it would be easier, safer\" to let the divorce play out and to trust James \"would be fair to me in the end.\"",
      "Still, she questioned why she should trust him and admitted to feeling \"an almost nihilistic desire to set flame to the remaining structures of my former life, to the very safety I clung to, to the fiction that I could depend on anyone other than myself for protection, to the idea that being quiet was the only way to be good.\"",
      "Six months later, a judge dismissed the counterclaim and enforced the prenup, then set a trial date to resolve the issue of child support and their joint property. James, Burden wrote, hadn't brought up her counterclaim in the months after she initially filed it, but after it was dismissed, he was \"inflamed by it.\"",

      "\"He said he would give me only the minimum child support required by law,\" she claimed. \"He said I would have to face the consequences of the prenup, of my failed counterclaim.\"",
      "Soon after, James' lawyer wrote her a letter, assuming that she'd want to buy James out of his interest in their two homes. She couldn't afford that, so she began coming to terms with the idea that she'd have to sell both. It was then, she recalled, that things became \"very dark.\"",
      "She grappled with the idea of her children losing the homes they'd known all their lives and with losing what her family had left to her, as well as her own financial security.",
      "\"There was no reason for it, given James\u2019s resources, given his desire to shed, given his refusal to make a home for the kids,\" she wrote. \"It felt like he was playing a game, or running a deal, one he was going to win at all costs, by a wide margin, regardless of the impact on me and our children.\"",
      "In the end, an hour before their trial was to begin, Burden and James reached a settlement on their own. He negotiated the terms, and she said that she \"had to be calm, deferential, grateful,\" and that if she got her lawyer involved or \"pushed him,\" he would withdraw the offer altogether.",
      "Burden, with stepmother Susan and her former husband, was able to keep both homes she purchased with her trusts. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",

      "She said when she signed the agreement, she tried to let everything go and that she's been mostly successful. These days, she doesn't think about the money or the details of the split, but there are some things about the divorce that chill her.",

      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani ran on a message of making the Big Apple more affordable for everyday Americans, but some of his actions in the first few weeks of his tenure have served to undercut that reality.",
      "In the early days of his time as mayor, Mamdani has already shown a penchant for vehemently defending low-wage, unskilled delivery-app workers in a manner that industry executives and business experts think will hit consumers' pocketbooks. He sued a delivery app startup earlier this month for allegedly violating the city's worker-rights laws, and warned the broader range of delivery app companies operating in the city to abide by ramped up worker rights being imposed at the end of the month, or else.",
      "At a press conference announcing the lawsuit and accompanying demand letters issued to delivery app companies warning them to follow the updated worker protections, Mamdani also accused the delivery-app startup, MotoClick, of stealing workers' tips. Among the reforms Mamdani has signaled he plans to vigorously enforce is a mandated tipping framework that estimates show could push more than half-a-billion in additional costs on consumers annually.",
      "The updated protections will also add more delivery-app companies, such as those that deliver groceries, to the list that must follow the delivery-app worker rights laws, including a mandated minimum wage higher than what some emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in the city make.",

      "\"We know affordability is not just about the cost of goods \u2014 it\u2019s about the dignity of work,\" Mamdani's Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) Sam Levine told companies including DoorDash, GrubHub and Uber. \"Today\u2019s lawsuit against\u00a0Motoclick\u00a0is not just an action against one company,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a warning to every app-based company from this Administration. You cannot treat workers like they are expendable and get away with it. We will seek full back pay and damages. We will seek full accountability.\"",
      "Mamdani pointed to a recent report put out by Levine, which showed disobeying city mandates going into effect later this month, requiring apps to give the opportunity for customers to tip before or at the same time that an order has been placed, significantly impacts the amount of incoming tip revenue. Levine's report that Mamdani touted estimates alternative tipping frameworks, such as only allowing tips upon completion of a delivery, have altered tipping revenue by an estimated $550 million per year.",
      "Mamdani also stood by in tacit agreement during the press conference as delivery-app worker advocates called for an increase to their already mandated minimum wage they have that is approximately $4.50 higher for delivery-app drivers than the city's base minimum wage of $17 per hour. The workers said they wanted a mandate that they get paid $35 per hour, to which Mamdani replied: \"closed mouths don't get fed.\"",
      "Mamdani campaigned on raising the base minimum wage to $30 per hour for all New Yorkers by 2030.",

      "\"The challenges facing delivery workers, small businesses, and consumers are real, and deeply interconnected. That\u2019s why this issue cannot be reduced to a single policy lever or viewed in isolation,\" a spokesperson for the Bronx Chamber of Commerce told Fox News Digital. \"Small businesses across the Bronx and throughout New York City are already under extraordinary pressure. When additional costs are layered on without a full economic analysis, those costs are predictably passed down to consumers or absorbed through reduced hours, reduced staffing, or closures. When businesses close, communities lose jobs, services, and economic anchors, and the ripple effects are significant.\"",
      "The Chamber of Commerce spokesperson added that Mamdani has an opportunity \"to lead by tackling affordability in a holistic way,\" which they said would require \"comprehensive cost analysis and coordinated solutions that support workers while ensuring the small business ecosystem and consumer affordability are not unintentionally harmed.\"",

      "When reached for comment about the discrepancy between Mamdani's message of making New York City more affordable for everyone, versus his push to protect delivery-app worker rights that could impact consumer pricing, a New York City Hall spokesperson argued that \"the insinuation that putting more money in the pockets of delivery workers undercuts affordability is absurd.\"",
      "\"Delivery Workers are important members of our city\u2019s economy, and deserve to be paid fairly \u2013 anything less is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson added. \"As Mayor Mamdani continues to stand up for everyday New Yorkers and actualize his ambitious agenda to make New York City truly livable for families.

    "summary": "Democrats oppose DHS funding after federal agent-involved killing, risking partial government shutdown as Congress struggles with massive $1.2 trillion spending package.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Chad Pergram reports the latest on the Senate standoff over DHS funding.",
      "Funding for the Department of Homeland Security was already a question for some Democrats before the killing of Alex Pretti.",
      "But Saturday\u2019s killing by federal agents gave Democrats who were on the fence about supporting the upcoming government funding plan a reason to solidify their opposition. And the killing only hardened those who were opposed to funding DHS before.",
      "From a political standpoint, Democrats are compelled to fight this. Otherwise, their base will balk. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., endured brickbats from the liberal base last March when he and a group of other Democratic senators helped Republicans clear a filibuster to avoid a shutdown.",
      "Progressives raged at Schumer. And the Senate\u2019s top Democrat suddenly found himself crossways with House Democratic leaders who expected him to mount more of a fight over government funding.",
      "CONGRESS UNVEILS $1.2T SPENDING BILL AS PROGRESSIVE REVOLT BREWS OVER ICE FUNDING",
      "Lawmakers are teetering on the edge of a partial government shutdown with Homeland Security funding at the forefront of a heated debate. (Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "The liberal base certainly got that this fall as Democrats withheld their votes to fund the government and fought over expiring Obamacare subsidies. The government shuttered for 43 days. But Democrats never earned a restoration of Obamacare subsidies. The Senate took a vote related to restoring the subsidies. Nothing happened. The House actually passed a bill re-upping the subsidies for three years. But the issue remains at an impasse.",
      "Despite the fall brawl, Democratic congressional leaders faced a narrow path to walk for this funding round. They still felt pressure from the left to oppose money for DHS, long before the killing of Renee Good and Pretti. But Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not go to the mat to oppose funding this time. They wanted to finesse this, believing that a shutdown was bad politics for them after the fall experience. After all, Democrats never scored precisely what they wanted. By the same token, Schumer and Jeffries didn\u2019t wade deeply into the funding fight, perhaps afraid of breaking a fragile truce on spending bills.",
      "That all changed Saturday. Democrat after Democrat published statements that they wouldn\u2019t vote to fund DHS. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, caucuses with the Democrats. He was one senator instrumental to helping re-open the government last fall. King said he couldn\u2019t support funding this time around.",
      "MORE THAN HALF OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT PUSH AGAINST DHS CHIEF KRISTI NOEM",
      "So unless something changes by 11:59:59 p.m. ET on Friday, Jan. 30, 78% of the federal government will lack money to operate. The six-bill, $1.2 trillion spending package doesn\u2019t only fund the Department of Homeland Security, but it also provides money for the Pentagon, Health and Human Services, Labor & Housing programs, Transportation and Education.",
      "The DHS bill was radioactive in the House. So the House broke that bill off from the rest of the package. The House approved the DHS funding measure 220-207 with seven Democratic yeas. The House approved the remaining bills 341-88.",
      "The House then married the six bills together in one package, sent it to the Senate and left town.",
      "There was some grumbling from senators that this was a \"take it or leave it\" package.",
      "Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, announced he won't support the DHS funding bill following the fatal shooting in Minneapolis and as federal agents enter his home state. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)",
      "And after the shooting, all bets were off. On Saturday, Schumer declared that \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"",
      "Democrats implored Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to break off the DHS funding bill from the rest of the spending package and handle that separately. Otherwise, they would oppose the entire plan.",
      "On Monday, Schumer signaled that \"Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline.\" He also said that \"Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "$174B SPENDING PACKAGE TO AVERT SHUTDOWN CLEARS KEY HURDLE IN SENATE",
      "Well, this is an amalgamated appropriations bill sent over from the House. Not a Kit-Kat bar. You just can\u2019t break off one piece of it.",
      "In short, what Schumer is proposing would spark a government shutdown. It\u2019s not clear that there are the votes to do what Schumer is suggesting. And doubtful that the Senate would have the time. That\u2019s to say nothing of getting the House on the same page before the deadline. Moreover, the House would just have to magically accept the new Senate position. That\u2019s probably not going to happen considering what the House went through just to pass that minibus spending bill.",
      "And we have not even mentioned that most of the money that Democrats are crowing about for DHS is already out the door. In the One Big Beautiful Bill, Republicans approved $75 billion for border security and ICE through 2029. In that measure, Republicans converted \"discretionary spending\" (which Congress controls) into a \"mandatory appropriation\" through 2029. Yes, this tactic agitates Members of the Appropriations Committee. But this has been done before, notably by Democrats when approving Obamacare.",
      "What Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is proposing would, in essence, trigger a shutdown. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "So going after DHS right now would have little impact on the funding for ICE. However, Democrats could demand certain \"guardrails\" and changes in policy for ICE.",
      "From a parliamentary standpoint, ripping the six-bill package apart is a mess. First of all, the Senate must agree on a \"motion to strike\" the DHS section from the six-bill combo package. The Senate would have to vote on this. Or, in the interest of time, do this via unanimous consent. But because the \"motion to strike\" by itself is debatable, the issue could set up a possible filibuster. Sixty votes are needed to cut off debate on just that question alone \u2013 stripping the DHS provision from the rest of the overall bill.",
      "It\u2019s important that a motion to strike the DHS money from the rest of the bill does not mean that the remaining five bills are ready to go. The Senate would have to agree that this is the new bill. Senators would then have to overcome a filibuster once and then vote to pass the bill. Those floor mechanics get you well past the early Saturday morning deadline.",
      "REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: GOP REBELS DEFY TRUMP AS CONGRESSIONAL GRIP CONTINUES TO WEAKEN ACROSS MULTIPLE VOTES",
      "Then the Senate must tangle with passing the standalone DHS funding bill by itself. That certainly isn\u2019t going to be done by Saturday morning.",
      "Moreover, none of these scenarios even addresses the House. If the Senate did approve the revamped five-bill spending package and the solitary DHS bill, the measures must return to the House. The House would have to vote on a \"motion to concur\" on the five-bill minibus. And then separately, on the solo DHS measure. That\u2019s probably untenable in the House. Anything under this plan wouldn\u2019t meet the early Saturday morning deadline. In addition, the House could glue the bills together another way and send it back to the Senate. Or, the House could even move to go to a conference committee and try to blend the bills into one.",
      "There is no easy way out of this at such a late date. And that\u2019s why you likely have a partial government shutdown at 12:00:01 a.m. ET on Saturday.",
      "Despite ICE being funded by One Big Beautiful Bill, disruptions to other services loom ahead. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Even though ICE is funded thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, there\u2019s a big penalty and disruption and other services. TSA agents are unpaid again. That\u2019s a major problem considering what they went through this fall \u2013 and coming on the heels of the monster winter storm which swept across the country in the past few days. Air traffic controllers would again face the lack of a paycheck as part of the transportation spending bill.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Then, there are the politics. Who gets blamed? Republicans are concerned about losing support from voters based on the tactics of ICE. That\u2019s why some Republicans are searching for some changes \u2013 but not ready to nuke the spending bill. Meantime, if the government shuts down thanks to Democrats withholding their votes, that may resonate with progressives. But it may hurt the party if Democrats are viewed as the party responsible for another shutdown.",
      "This is a tough situation all around. And there\u2019s not an obvious off-ramp.",

      "Who is behind Uber's robotaxi",
      "Uber is the name most riders recognize. However, two partners handle the technology behind the scenes. Lucid Group builds the all-electric vehicle. It is based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, which was designed for long-range efficiency and passenger comfort. Nuro provides the self-driving system. Nuro also leads testing and safety validation. Together, the three companies are developing a robotaxi service that will be available only through Uber.",
      "Uber's robotaxi is already driving itself",
      "Autonomous on-road testing began last month in the Bay Area. These tests take place on public streets rather than private test tracks. Nuro runs the testing program using trained safety operators who supervise each trip. The focus is on everyday driving situations such as intersections, lane changes, traffic lights and pedestrians. This stage is critical. It allows engineers to evaluate how the system behaves in real conditions before opening rides to the public.",
      "What makes Uber's robotaxi different",
      "Uber's robotaxi was designed from the start to operate without a driver. It combines electric vehicle engineering with visible autonomy features that riders can understand.",

      "A robotaxi ride that explains itself",
      "One standout feature is transparency. Riders can see how the robotaxi perceives the road and plans its next move. The display shows lane changes, yielding behavior, slowing at traffic lights and the planned drop-off point. This helps riders understand what the vehicle is doing instead of guessing. Inside the cabin, passengers can adjust heated seats, climate controls and music. They can also contact support or request the vehicle to pull over if needed.",

      "Uber plans to deploy 20,000 or more robotaxis over the next six years. These vehicles will operate in dozens of U.S. and international markets. Lucid will integrate all required hardware directly on the production line at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Uber will own and operate the vehicles along with third-party fleet partners. Every robotaxi ride will be booked through the Uber app, just like a standard Uber trip.",
      "How Uber is handling robotaxi safety and regulation",
      "Safety sits at the center of this rollout. Nuro's validation process combines simulation, closed-course testing and supervised on-road driving. The system relies on an end-to-end AI foundation model paired with clear safety logic. The goal is predictable, comfortable driving across a wide range of conditions. Uber and its partners are also working with regulators, policymakers and local governments to ensure the service aligns with public safety standards and city planning goals.",
      "When Uber's driverless rides are expected to launch",
      "Uber says the first autonomous rides will launch in a major U.S. city later in 2026. The service will be available exclusively through the Uber app. Production of the robotaxi is expected to begin later this year, pending final validation.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you use Uber, driverless rides may soon appear as an option. These vehicles could offer quieter trips, more consistent driving and improved availability during peak times. For cities, a shared electric robotaxi fleet could help reduce emissions and congestion. For riders, seeing how the vehicle thinks and reacts may make autonomous travel feel less intimidating.",

      "Tuya Smart just introduced Aura, its first AI-powered companion robot made for pets.",
      "Aura is designed specifically for household cats and dogs, with AI trained to recognize their behaviors, movements and vocal cues. The idea behind Aura is simple. Pets need more than food bowls and cameras. They need attention, interaction and reassurance.",
      "Aura stays active in the home, watches for behavior changes and responds in real time so owners can better understand how their pets are doing. Many pets struggle when left alone for long hours. Small changes often show up first. A dog may stop playing. A cat may hide or groom excessively. These signs can point to stress or anxiety. Aura steps in during those quiet stretches, offering engagement instead of an empty room.",

      "Why emotional intelligence matters for pets",
      "Smart feeders and pet cameras handle the basics. Emotional care is a different story. Pets are social. When routines change, their mood can shift quickly. Aura tracks behavior and listens for changes in sound patterns. It can tell whether a pet feels excited, anxious, lonely, or relaxed. Aura then sends real-time emotional updates to an owner's phone. That makes it easier to spot issues early rather than guessing after the fact.",
      "How Aura interacts with pets at home",
      "Aura acts more like a companion than a device that sits still. Several systems work together throughout the day to keep pets engaged. Key features include:",
      "Laser play and treat dispensing for active interactionSimulated pet sounds with expressive animated eyesVoice interaction, which is designed to feel natural and responsive",

      "Instead of waiting for a button press, Aura looks for opportunities to engage. It turns long, quiet hours into moments of play and stimulation.",
      "Capturing moments that matter",
      "Aura also keeps an eye out for moments worth saving. Using AI pet recognition and intelligent tracking, it captures everyday highlights like playful bursts, calm naps and funny interactions. Aura can automatically turn these clips into short videos. That helps owners stay connected and feel closer to their pets even when they are away. It also makes it easier to capture moments you might never catch on your own and share them with family or post on social media.",

      "How Aura moves and recharges on its own",
      "Movement is a big part of Aura's role in the home. With V-SLAM navigation, binocular vision and AIVI object recognition, Aura moves freely while avoiding obstacles. When the battery runs low, it returns to its feeding and charging dock on its own. That keeps it ready without constant attention from owners.",
      "A bigger ecosystem around pet care",
      "Aura connects to Tuya's broader ecosystem, which opens access to services beyond the home. These include smart pet boarding, health and medical care, behavior training, grooming, customization and community tools. Instead of handling one task, Aura becomes a central hub for pet care that can evolve over time.",
      "More than a pet robot",
      "Aura focuses on pets today, but the technology behind it reaches further. Emotional awareness, proactive assistance and ecosystem integration could also support elder care, home monitoring and family connectivity. Starting with pets gives Tuya a clear emotional use case while setting the stage for future home robotics.",

      "Tuya has not shared a release date or pricing for Aura yet. The company unveiled the robot earlier this month at CES 2026, but details on availability and cost remain unclear. Those specifics are likely to come closer to a wider consumer launch. Even so, Aura signals a shift in how smart home technology shows up for pets. It moves beyond simple monitoring and leans into interaction and emotional awareness. If Aura delivers on its promise, it could help pet owners feel more comfortable leaving their pets home alone while staying connected throughout the day.",

      "The fake Chrome extensions to watch out for",
      "Security researchers from Socket's Threat Research Team identified five malicious Chrome extensions connected to this campaign. The add-ons were marketed as productivity or security tools, but were designed to hijack accounts.",
      "The extensions include:",
      "DataByCloud AccessTool Access 11DataByCloud 1DataByCloud 2Software Access",
      "DataByCloud Access",
      "Tool Access 11",
      "DataByCloud 1",
      "DataByCloud 2",
      "Software Access",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy that the extensions are no longer available on the Chrome Web Store. However, some are still available on third-party software download sites, which continues to pose a risk. If you see any of these names installed in your browser, remove them immediately.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions look legitimate",
      "These malicious add-ons are designed to look legitimate. They use professional names, polished dashboards and business-focused descriptions. Some claim to offer faster access to workplace tools. Others say they restrict user actions to protect company accounts. Privacy policies often promise that no personal data is collected. For people juggling daily work tasks or managing business accounts, the pitch sounds helpful rather than suspicious.",
      "What these extensions actually do",
      "After installation, the extensions operate silently in the background. They steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data that tell websites you are already logged in. When attackers get these cookies, they can access accounts without a password. At the same time, some extensions block access to security pages. Users may be unable to change passwords, disable accounts or review login history. One extension even allows criminals to insert stolen login sessions into another browser. That lets them sign in instantly as the victim.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions are so dangerous",
      "This attack goes beyond stealing credentials. It removes the ability to respond. Security teams may detect unusual activity, but cannot fix it through normal controls. Password changes fail. Account settings disappear. Two-factor authentication tools become unreachable. As a result, attackers can maintain access for long periods without being stopped.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can be useful, but this research shows how easily they can also be abused. These fake Chrome add-ons did not rely on flashy tricks or obvious warnings. They blended in, looked professional and quietly did their damage in the background. The good news is that you do not need to be a tech expert to protect yourself. Taking a few minutes to review your extensions, remove anything unfamiliar and lock down your accounts can make a real difference. Small habits, repeated regularly, go a long way in reducing risk. If there is one takeaway here, it is this: convenience should never come at the cost of security. A clean browser and strong account protections give you back control.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",
      "Researchers, however, have raised questions about how quickly patches reach users and how much visibility Google has into real-world abuse that does not involve Google hardware. They also argue that weaknesses in certification allowed flawed implementations to reach the market at scale, suggesting broader systemic issues.",
      "For now, both Google and the researchers agree on one key point. Users must install manufacturer firmware updates to be protected, and availability may vary by device and brand.",
      "SMART HOME HACKING FEARS: WHAT\u2019S REAL AND WHAT\u2019S HYPE",
      "Unwanted tracking notification showing the victim's own device. (KU Leuven)",
      "How to reduce your risk right now",
      "You cannot disable Fast Pair entirely, but you can lower your exposure.",
      "If you use a Bluetooth accessory that supports Google Fast Pair, including wireless earbuds, headphones or speakers, you may be affected. The researchers created a public lookup tool that lets you search for your specific device model and see whether it is vulnerable. Checking your device is a simple first step before deciding what actions to take. Visit whisperpair.eu/vulnerable-devices to see if your device is on the list.",
      "Install the official app from your headphone or speaker manufacturer. Check for firmware updates and apply them promptly.",
      "Pair new devices in private spaces. Avoid pairing in airports, caf\u00e9s or gyms where strangers are nearby.",
      "Unexpected audio interruptions, strange sounds or dropped connections are warning signs.\u00a0 A factory reset can remove unauthorized pairings, but it does not fix the underlying vulnerability. A firmware update is still required.",
      "Bluetooth only needs to be on during active use. Turning off Bluetooth when not in use limits exposure, but it does not eliminate the underlying risk if the device remains unpatched.",
      "Always factory reset used headphones or speakers before pairing them. This removes hidden links and account associations.",
      "Investigate Find Hub or Apple tracking alerts, even if they appear to reference your own device.",
      "Install operating system updates promptly. Platform patches can block exploit paths even when accessories lag behind.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "WhisperPair shows how small shortcuts can lead to large privacy failures. Headphones feel harmless. Yet, they contain microphones, radios and software that need care and updates. Ignoring them leaves a blind spot that attackers are happy to exploit. Staying secure now means paying attention to the devices you once took for granted.",

      "Designed to break down safely",
      "Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "AI assistants are supposed to make life easier. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can help you write emails, summarize documents and answer questions using information from your own account. But security researchers are now warning that a single bad link could quietly turn that convenience into a privacy risk.",
      "A newly discovered attack method shows how attackers could hijack a Copilot session and siphon data without you seeing anything suspicious on screen.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. They help detect phishing links, malicious scripts and suspicious behavior tied to browser activity. Since Reprompt-style attacks start with a single click, having real-time protection can stop you before damage happens, especially when attacks look legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Check your Microsoft account activity for unfamiliar logins, locations, or actions. Review what services Copilot can access, and revoke anything you no longer need. These checks don't take long, but they can reveal issues early, before attackers have time to do serious damage. Here's how:",
      "Go to account.microsoft.com, and sign in to your Microsoft account.",
      "Select Security, then choose View my sign-in activity and verify your identity if prompted.",
      "Review each login for unfamiliar locations, devices or failed sign-in attempts.",
      "If you see anything suspicious, select This wasn't me or Secure your account, then change your password immediately and enable two-step verification.",
      "Visit account.microsoft.com/devices, and remove any devices you no longer recognize or use.",
      "In Microsoft Edge, open Settings > Appearance > Copilot and Sidebar > Copilot, and turn off Allow Microsoft to access page content if you want to limit Copilot's access.",
      "Review apps connected to your Microsoft account and revoke permissions you no longer need.",
      "A single Copilot link can carry hidden instructions that run the moment you click, without any warning or pop-ups.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Avoid giving AI assistants broad authority like \"handle whatever is needed.\" Wide permissions make it easier for hidden instructions to influence outcomes. Keep requests narrow and task-focused. The less freedom an AI has, the harder it is for malicious prompts to steer it silently.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Reprompt doesn't mean Copilot is unsafe to use, but it does show how much trust these tools require. When an AI assistant can think, remember and act for you, even a single bad click can matter. Keeping your system updated and being selective about what you click remain just as important in the age of AI as it was before.",

      "Why ice storms are especially disruptive",
      "Ice storms cause more damage than most people expect. Unlike snow, ice sticks to everything and adds significant weight. Ice builds up on trees and power lines, causing branches to snap and lines to fall. Utility crews often cannot begin repairs until conditions improve, which delays restoration.

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "If your information was exposed in this breach or any similar ransomware incident, there are concrete steps you can take to reduce the fallout.",
      "If the company offers free credit monitoring or identity protection, enroll in it. These services can alert you early if someone tries to open accounts or misuse your identity. If nothing is offered, consider signing up for a reputable identity theft protection service on your own.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "The less of your information that's floating around data broker sites, the harder it is for criminals to target you. Data removal services can help reduce your digital footprint over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "In the Gulshan attack, hackers spent days inside internal systems, stealing personal data before deploying ransomware that locked down files. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

      "Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A California startup wants to flip that idea on its head.",
      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",
      "The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your personal space.",

      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",

      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",

      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",

      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",

      "The companies confirmed the partnership in a joint statement, signaling a major shift in how Apple plans to deliver AI features across the iPhone, iPad and Mac.",

      "Apple and Google have entered a multiyear AI partnership that will shape the future of Apple Intelligence and Siri. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",

      "Google\u2019s Gemini models will help power Apple\u2019s next-generation AI features while Apple keeps control of on-device processing and privacy. (REUTERS/Norbert von der Groeben)",
      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "The deal signals a strategic shift as Apple accelerates its AI roadmap to deliver smarter, more personalized experiences across its devices. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems. In short, users get better AI without giving up Apple's privacy stance, at least in theory.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward. If Apple delivers on its promises, this deal could finally close the AI gap that has frustrated users and investors alike. The real test will come when those features land on your devices.",

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OKIf they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third dayThe alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",

      "If they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third day",
      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The viral \"Are You Dead?\" app alerts an emergency contact if a user fails to check in every two days. (Photo by Stefan Sauer/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",
      "Planned updates include:",

      "Adding direct messaging to emergency contacts",
      "Making the app more friendly for older users",
      "Reconsidering the app's name",
      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "\"Are You Dead?\" succeeds because it addresses a fear many people rarely say out loud. As more people live alone, the worry is not only about loneliness but also about invisibility. A simple tap every two days becomes a quiet signal that someone still knows you are here. The app may evolve, change its name or add features. The problem it highlights is not going away.",

      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning about a growing cyber threat that turns everyday QR codes into spying tools.",
      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",

      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "A 2020 plan by the Trump administration, known as \"Peace to Prosperity,\" envisioned Israeli annexation of parts of Judea and Samaria but was shelved in favor of the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel\u2019s relations with four Arab countries. In July 2024, the Knesset plenum overwhelmingly rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state, and in July 2025, approved a declaration calling on the government to apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria as well as the Jordan Valley, something Vice President JD Vance described as a \"very stupid political stunt,\" when asked his thoughts on the vote.",

      "According to polls, Oren said, most Palestinians oppose a two-state solution and support the Oct. 7 attacks.",

      "\"None of this means it can happen soon, or perhaps at all. If it ever does, it will take longer and look different from earlier efforts. It is not a copy-and-paste of ideas from the Oslo era. But that credible pathway to a Palestinian state \u2014 one that would live peacefully alongside a secure Israel \u2014 difficult as it is, remains relevant,\" he added.",
      "Shapiro noted that even Israel\u2019s current government \u2014 the most right-wing in the country\u2019s history and one that includes multiple proponents of annexation \u2014 has stopped short of applying sovereignty across the West Bank, a sign, he said, that the political and diplomatic costs remain too high.",

      "Shapiro said that preserving the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state on some portion of the territory \u2014 even if it appears distant and would require major changes in Palestinian leadership and society \u2014 has remained relevant, even under Israeli governments that profess to oppose any two-state outcome.",

      "China\u2019s sudden removal of senior military leaders, including allegations that a top general leaked sensitive information to the United States, is raising new questions about internal turmoil inside the Chinese Communist Party and the readiness of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Experts told Fox News Digital that while many details remain unclear, the scope of the apparent purge points to mounting instability under Chinese President Xi Jinping, with potential implications for regional security and rising tensions around Taiwan.",
      "Beijing has not publicly confirmed espionage allegations, but reports published in Western media describe an extraordinary shakeup within China\u2019s military leadership. Analysts caution that the lack of transparency makes definitive conclusions difficult, yet say the pattern of removals itself signals a system under strain.",

      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the developments appear driven by political control rather than an imminent move toward conflict.",
      "\"These unprecedented purges reflect Xi\u2019s clear focus on control and cohesion \u2014 ensuring the People\u2019s Liberation Army is politically reliable, centralized and obedient before it can be tasked with high-risk operations,\" Singleton told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"This does not mean conflict is imminent, but it does show how seriously Xi treats the prospect of having to use the military in the coming years.\"",
      "Singleton said some observers have compared the developments to past authoritarian crackdowns, but argued a different historical parallel is more instructive.",
      "\"Some analysts are comparing these developments to Stalin-era purges in the late 1930s. There certainly are echoes, but I think the closer analogy is Moscow in 1979 \u2014 when Soviet political leaders pushed for the invasion of Afghanistan despite strong military warnings that it would be unsustainable and devolve into a costly guerrilla war.\"",
      "He warned that China may now be facing a similar disconnect between political leadership and military reality.",
      "\"Xi\u2019s purges may reflect a similar dynamic: political urgency to speed up invasion planning over Taiwan colliding with a military that senior Chinese officers know isn\u2019t ready yet.\"",

      "China expert Gordon Chang, told Fox News Digital the uncertainty surrounding the purge highlights the depth of instability inside China\u2019s system.",
      "\"There\u2019s no way to make sense of this right now,\" Chang said. \"All we can say is that the situation is fluid, that the regime is in turmoil, and probably the People\u2019s Liberation Army is not ready to engage in major operations because dozens of senior officers have been either arrested or removed.\"",
      "\"This is an extraordinary situation,\" he added. \"And this means that China, the country itself, not just the regime, but the country itself is unstable.\"",
      "Chang also addressed reports alleging that a senior Chinese general was accused of providing sensitive nuclear-related material to the United States, claims that have not been officially substantiated by Beijing.",
      "\"The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ministry of National Defense has accused General Zhang Xiaoxiao of providing core technical material on China\u2019s nuclear weapons to the United States,\" Chang said.",
      "\"That is really extraordinary. It also doesn\u2019t sound right, because General Zhang just would not have that many opportunities to pass that type of material to the U.S.\"",
      "Chang emphasized that his assessment was speculative. \"This is just a guess, this is speculation,\" he said, adding that such accusations may serve as justification for harsh internal punishment rather than reflect confirmed espionage.",
      "He also pointed to past intelligence failures to underscore his skepticism. \"We know that the CIA has not had a good track record in China,\" Chang said, noting that about 30 CIA assets were executed after being uncovered several years ago.",
      "\"It would be stunning that the CIA has been able to reconstitute itself and get that type of material from one of the most senior figures in the Chinese regime,\" he said. \"At this point I have to say that trust but verify.\"",

      "\"We are seeing a whole class of leadership being junked,\" he said, noting that the detained general was the most senior uniformed officer in China and second only to Xi Jinping within the Communist Party\u2019s Central Military Commission. \"To arrest and detain him is extraordinary by itself.\"",
      "Singleton said that while purges may weaken China\u2019s military in the short term, they could create greater risk over time.",
      "\"Purges can degrade near-term readiness, but over the long-term they increase political control over the military and reduce dissent, easing the path for riskier decisions down the line,\" he said.",
      "Turning to Taiwan, Chang said a deliberate invasion remains unlikely given the current turmoil and the complexity of such an operation.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Family members of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in October sued the U.S. government Tuesday, accusing it of wrongful death and extrajudicial killings.",
      "The lawsuit is the first of its kind to be filed against the Trump administration in federal court over its military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "Chad Joseph, 26, and Rishi Samaroo, 41, were killed in the U.S. military strike Oct. 14 while they were on a boat traveling from Venezuela to Trinidad, their family members allege in the lawsuit. The lawsuit says Joseph and Samaroo \u201chad been fishing in waters off the Venezuelan coast and working on farms in Venezuela.\u201d It says they were returning to their homes in Las Cuevas in Trinidad and Tobago when their boat was struck.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Donald Trump said the strike killed all six men on the boat. Trump described them as \u201csix male narcoterrorists\u201d and said that the boat was \u201caffiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization\u201d and that it \u201cwas trafficking narcotics.\u201d The strike was the administration\u2019s fifth in a campaign that has struck three dozen boats and killed at least 125 people, according to the Defense Department, since it began in early September.",
      "In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the Pentagon said in a statement, \"Per longstanding department policy, we don't comment on ongoing litigation.\"",
      "NBC News asked the White House for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The families were not notified that their loved ones had been killed, but both held memorial services after they learned of the Oct. 14 strike and after Joseph and Samaroo were not heard from again, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Joseph\u2019s mother and Samaroo\u2019s sister are suing the U.S. government on behalf of the two men\u2019s surviving family members. The lawsuit was filed by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union; the Center for Constitutional Rights; Jonathan Hafetz, a professor at Seton Hall Law School; and the ACLU of Massachusetts.",
      "It says the Oct. 14 airstrike violated two federal statutes: the Death on the High Seas Act, which allows family members to sue over wrongful deaths that occur more than 3 nautical miles from the U.S., and the Alien Tort Statute, which allows foreign nationals to sue in federal court over violations of international law.",
      "The Trump administration has told members of Congress that the U.S. is in a non-international armed conflict with drug cartels, citing that as justification for using lethal military force against alleged drug boats.",
      "The lawsuit challenges that justification. It says that there is no armed conflict and that therefore the laws of war do not apply.",
      "\u201cThese premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThus, they were simply murders, ordered by individuals at the highest levels of government and obeyed by military officers in the chain of command.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit quotes the Trinidadian government as saying that \u201cthe government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities\u201d and that it had \u201cno information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms.\u201d",
      "Joseph\u2019s mother and Samaroo\u2019s sister say in the lawsuit that the two men were the primary breadwinners for their families and were simply returning home from working in Venezuela when they were killed.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Joseph lived in Las Cuevas, Trinidad, with his common-law wife and their three minor children, but he often traveled the 20 nautical miles to Venezuela for work. He would sometimes stay in Venezuela for weeks or even months, and during this trip he had been working there since April, the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says that in the weeks before he was killed, Joseph had struggled to find a boat in Venezuela to take him back to Trinidad. It says he became increasingly fearful of making the trip home after the Trump administration began its boat strikes campaign.",
      "The lawsuit says that Joseph called his wife and mother daily and that his last call to them was Oct. 12 to tell them he had found a ride back home, but he never returned.",
      "\u201cChad was a loving and caring son who was always there for me, for his wife and children, and for our whole family. I miss him terribly. We all do,\u201d Joseph\u2019s mother, Lenore Burnley, said in a statement. \u201cWe know this lawsuit won\u2019t bring Chad back to us, but we\u2019re trusting God to carry us through this, and we hope that speaking out will help get us some truth and closure.\u201d",
      "Samaroo worked in construction before he spent 15 years in prison for his participation in a homicide, and he also frequently traveled to Venezuela for work in construction and farming, according to the lawsuit. He shared photos of the farm he was working on with his sister before he died, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cRishi used to call our family almost every day and then one day he disappeared, and we never heard from him again,\u201d Sallycar Korasingh, Rishi Samaroo\u2019s sister, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cRishi was a hardworking man who paid his debt to society and was just trying to get back on his feet again and to make a decent living in Venezuela to help provide for his family,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the U.S. government believed Rishi had done anything wrong, it should have arrested, charged, and detained him, not murdered him. They must be held accountable.\u201d"

      "Patel said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that he wanted to know whether any Minnesota residents had put federal agents \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d with activities such as sharing agents\u2019 license plate numbers and locations.",

      "For months, digital tools have been at the center of how people have pushed back against immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota and across the country. The administration\u2019s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials criticized ICEBlock, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple removed the app from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit from the app\u2019s developer alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it.",

On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got 20 million views, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby\u2019s claims.",
      "Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.",
      "\u201cAs soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat \u2014 being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country \u2014 if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.\u201d",
      "The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is a go-to resource for people concerned about privacy.  It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share sensitive military information last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.",
      "In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a standard part of toolkits \u2014 along with walkie-talkies and whistles \u2014 used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with more than 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.",
      "Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.",
      "The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.",
      "\u201cThe ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,\u201d Abdo said in an email.",
      "\u201cUnless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI would \u201cbalance\u201d the rights guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.",
      "\u201cNow, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,\u201d he said. The Second Amendment could be at issue because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.",
      "Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to \u201cbalance\u201d the First Amendment against its other interests.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official\u2019s desire to suppress speech they dislike,\u201d he said in his email.",
      "He added: \u201cThere is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn\u2019t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm\u2019s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.\u201d",
      "Patel also said the FBI had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are \u201cnot happening organically\u201d but did not immediately provide evidence."

      "PARK CITY, Utah \u2014 The news began to hit the Sundance Film Festival as people were stepping out of dark movie theaters onto snowy sidewalks or waking up after a long night of partying in the bars and lounges on Main Street.",
      "\u201cIf you all have not heard what\u2019s going on in Minnesota this morning, someone else was murdered by ICE,\u201d director Ava DuVernay said, referring to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti as she began to ask a question while seated in the audience at a panel on freedom of expression Saturday afternoon.",
      "About two hours later, Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., identified himself on X as the person who was \u201cpunched in the face\u201d at a party hosted by the talent agency CAA on Friday by a man who allegedly told him President Donald Trump was going to deport him.",
      "The political temperature during the early days of the 2026 festival was wide-ranging. While some filmmakers and stars wore \u201cBe Good\u201d and \u201cICE OUT\u201d pins, many of the film premieres and brand-sponsored lounges remained largely apolitical zones.",
      "But by Saturday afternoon, as attendees hopped around Park City, many were also watching videos of the killing of Pretti, a Minnesota nurse, on their cellphones, and a sense of cognitive dissonance began to permeate the festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be somewhere like this \u2026 wear nice outfits and talk about film, when something so ugly is happening right next to us,\u201d actor Jenna Ortega told reporters ahead of the premiere of her new movie, \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d on Saturday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sitting here talking about movies while an illegal army is being mounted against U.S. citizens,\u201d Edward Norton, who co-stars in \u201cThe Invite,\u201d told The Hollywood Reporter.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, much of Hollywood was vocally critical of the president, but this time, the entertainment industry's response has been more muted, with some \u2014 including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence \u2014 saying they felt their prior activism made little impact.",
      "There is a history of political activists taking advantage of the spotlight that Sundance can help them shine on an issue: During the 2024 festival, the group Arabs in Utah shut down Main Street to draw attention to the conflict in Gaza. In 2017, 8,000 people showed up to a women\u2019s march led by comedian Chelsea Handler and sponsored by groups including Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019S List to protest Trump's first inauguration.",
      "This year, the streets were not as populated by protesters. A small crowd of people in Park City took to Main Street on Sunday \u2014 where many of the festival activations take place \u2014 holding anti-ICE signs. Later in the evening, roughly 100 people gathered on Main Street again for a 10-minute \u201cSundancers Melt Ice\u201d rally, this time turning on the lights in their phones as part of another solidarity rally against ICE. \"Lord of the Rings\" star Elijah Wood was among the attendees, according to Deadline. (NBC News has reached out to Wood's representative for comment).",
      "The conversations around politics were largely unfolding at panels, such as the American Civil Liberties Union event attended by DuVernay, and as the stars were promoting their films on red carpets ahead of their premieres.",
      "\u201cI wanted to take a moment to acknowledge everything that is happening in Minnesota,\u201d filmmaker Kogonada told the audience at the screening of his film, \u201cZi.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a believer in what [Roger] Ebert says that cinema is an empathizing machine. In the darkest time, you hope that art doesn\u2019t feel indulgent but that it deepens our sense of humanity. I feel like more than ever it is important to do that to counter what is happening around the world.\u201d",
      "On Friday, actor Kerry Washington spoke at a panel titled \u201cDemocracy On the Screen \u2014 And On The Line,\u201d hosted by Elevate Studios and the Impact Lounge. That same day, the think tank African American Policy Forum hosted a panel titled \u201cThe Story of Us \u2014 The New McCarthyism: Why Authoritarians Fear Storytellers,\u201d which included perspectives from DuVernay, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen and Tony-winning actor Kara Young.",
      "\u201cICE OUT\u201d pins were spotted across Park City over the weekend, worn by stars such as Natalie Portman, Olivia Wilde and Zoey Deutch.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately,\u201d Portman, Ortega\u2019s co-star in \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d told Variety on Saturday. \u201cBut also, there\u2019s a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They\u2019re showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It\u2019s a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we\u2019re so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm,\u201d she told Variety. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. People are being murdered. And, I don\u2019t want to normalize seeing people being murdered on the internet. ... It\u2019s hideous. And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimize this unbelievably criminal organization, then that\u2019s what we should be doing.\u201d"

      "\"Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing and you\u2019re panicking. Right on cue, you\u2019re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me. Years of \u2018investigations\u2019 have found nothing. Get your goons out of Minnesota,\" she wrote.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NBC News also reached out to the offices of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.",
      "Trump has attacked Omar, the first Somali-American elected to Congress, and the larger Somali-American community for weeks.  As his administration faces growing outrage over its handling of immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area, he and his allies have drawn renewed attention to fraud allegations involving Somali-run day care centers.",
      "Trump reacted to the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis man on Saturday in part by pointing to Omar.",
      "\"Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account?\" he said on Truth Social. \"And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota?\" Trump said U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement is in the state to investigate \"massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing, and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats\u2019 Open Border Policy. We want the money back, and we want it back, NOW.\"",
      "Omar has disputed conservatives' claims, amplified by Trump, about her net worth.",
      "In a video on social media in September, she said: \"Last year, some GOP crazies said I was worth $83 million. Now they\u2019re saying I\u2019m worth over $30 million. The value range listed for the assets reflects the full cost assessment of the businesses, in which my husband is one of several partners, and does not reflect his individual share. PS: Keep wishing millions into existence so I could pay off these student loans.\"",
      "Omar referred to her 2024 financial disclosure report, which all members of the House are required to file, which showed a Rose Lake Capital LLC listed as having a value of $5 million to $25 million. That was listed as \u201cpartnership income,\u201d and it said \u201cnone\u201d for income for Omar. It also listed ESTCRU LLC, which had a value of $1 million to $5 million. The actual income listed for Omar was between $5,000 and $15,000.",
      "The Trump administration has faced overwhelming criticism for how it has handled Minnesota, including the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and, a few weeks ago, Renee Nicole Good.",
      "Omar is the latest Minnesota Democrat to face Justice Department scrutiny. NBC News reported last week last week that the Justice Department subpoenaed Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Jacob Frey and other state leaders as part of an investigation into whether Minnesota officials conspired to block federal immigration operations. Walz and Frey denied wrongdoing. Walz wrote on X that the probe is \"political theater\" and a \"partisan distraction.\" Frey accused the administration of \"weaponiz[ing] its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs.\"",
      "The Minnesota investigations follow a slew of probes of other frequent Trump targets, most of them Democrats."

      "At the core of the debate is that Pretti \u2014 who was permitted to carry a gun in public in Minnesota \u2014 had a concealed firearm on his person that eyewitness videos show federal agents apparently discovering and removing during the altercation that led to his death. Videos do not appear to show Pretti holding the weapon during that confrontation.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sought to justify the killing by asserting at a news conference that Pretti \u201cattacked those officers, had a weapon on him, and multiple dozens of rounds of ammunition, wishing to inflict harm on these officers coming, brandishing like that and impeding their work that they were doing.\u201d No evidence has been provided to back up this account.",

      "Charlie Kirk, the late co-founder of the young conservative group Turning Point USA who was killed by an assassin\u2019s bullet last year, explained his view in similar terms in 2023: \u201cThe Second Amendment is not about hunting.

The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government.\u201d",
      "Even Noem has articulated that point of view in the past, telling an NRA conference in 2023 that \u201cJoe Biden and the liberals want our guns\u201d because \u201cit will make it easier for them to infringe on all of our other rights.\u201d Additionally, the first law Noem signed when she was governor of South Dakota allowed residents of that state to carry concealed weapons without a permit.",
      "Conversely, Democrats have fought for just as long \u2014 in state legislatures, Congress and federal courts \u2014 to impose restrictions on firearms, who can own them and where they can be carried. These limitations, major gun-control groups and many Democratic lawmakers contend, protect the public. In 2020, liberals excoriated conservatives for celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who shot and killed two people during demonstrations against police violence in Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges against him.",

      "Until recently, that wasn\u2019t the case. But beginning in January, the monthly cost of her Affordable Care Act insurance jumped by about $300 \u2014 making it too expensive for them to afford. Bivona and her husband dropped down to a bronze plan, cutting their bill by more than half but leaving them with an $18,000 annual deductible.",
      "\u201cWe would have to take out a loan,\u201d said Bivona, a 37-year-old musician in Arizona. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of money, maybe a couple of thousand dollars in savings.\u201d",
      "More enrollees are making the same calculation this year: lower premiums now, far higher bills later if they need care.",
      "Once a safety net for healthier adults, bronze plans are becoming the default choice for a growing share of ACA enrollees in 2026, according to state officials.",
      "The shift marks a sharp break from past years, when most people gravitated toward silver plans that balance higher monthly premiums with lower deductibles. Now, many people are opting for the cheapest option available \u2014 not because they want to, but because it\u2019s all they can afford.",
      "\u201cPeople are feeling very price sensitive,\u201d said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state\u2019s ACA marketplace. \u201cThe expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits are putting a lot of people in a position where they\u2019re kind of barely able to hang on in terms of affording coverage. And that\u2019s where we see bronze plans picking up more.\u201d",
      "ACA plans are sold in four main tiers \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum \u2014 which work on a sliding scale: lower monthly premiums come with higher out-of-pocket costs, while higher premiums mean lower deductibles and copays. (Catastrophic plans, which are limited mostly to people under 30, make up a small share of ACA enrollment.)",
      "Bronze plans cover ACA benefits, including annual physicals, well-woman visits, cancer screenings and prescription drugs. But as the lowest tier, they often require people to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before most other coverage kicks in.",
      "The average annual deductible for a bronze ACA plan in 2026 is roughly $7,500 for an individual, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the bronze plan was that it would appeal to younger, healthier people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, director of the program on the ACA at KFF. \u201cYou could get a lower premium, you would potentially have a higher out-of-pocket cost, but only if you had a significant health care expense.\u201d",
      "Bivona and her husband fit that profile. Both are young and generally healthy, and she mostly uses her insurance for medications and the occasional doctor\u2019s appointment.",
      "This year, though, the decision wasn\u2019t about what plan made the most sense \u2014 it was about what they could afford.",

      "Health policy experts warn that a broad move toward bronze plans could lead more people to delay care, skip treatment or take on debt to pay for medical expenses \u2014 even though they technically have health insurance. The consequences could be especially severe for people with chronic conditions who are forced into worse coverage.",
      "\u201cIf a person suffers from chronic disease or experiences a health emergency, these high-deductible plans push people into bankruptcy,\u201d said Larry Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cAlso, with high deductibles, many people will hesitate to go for diagnosis and treatment. These delays can make patients sicker or even cause deaths.\u201d",
      "The change in plan selections stems from the expiration of the enhanced ACA subsidies at the end of last year, which pushed premiums higher and forced many people to prioritize monthly costs over more comprehensive coverage.",
      "Initial federal open enrollment data shows Obamacare sign-ups are down more than 800,000 from last year. The federal data hasn\u2019t yet broken down which plans people selected, leaving data from states \u2014 which do release plan selections \u2014 as the clearest picture of how coverage choices are changing.",
      "In Rhode Island, the move toward bronze plans has been especially pronounced among new enrollees, state officials said.",
      "As of early January, 38% of new enrollees had selected bronze plans for 2026, up from 15% two years earlier, while silver fell from 53% to 35% and gold dropped from 31% to 25%.",
      "\u201cBronze plan selection is up significantly and silver and gold selection is down significantly for new customers,\u201d Christina Spaight O\u2019Reilly, communications director for Rhode Island\u2019s ACA marketplace, wrote in an email.",
      "In California, more than a third of new ACA enrollees have chosen bronze plans for 2026, up from about 1 in 5 last year, state officials said. Nearly three-quarters of renewing customers who switched plan tiers also moved to bronze coverage.",
      "Officials in Kentucky, Idaho, Massachusetts, New York and Virginia also reported an increase in plan switching, with many enrollees moving to cheaper options. Data for Arizona, where Bivona lives, isn\u2019t yet available because it\u2019s federal.",
      "Still, Cox of KFF said, it\u2019s better to remain insured than to go without coverage altogether.",
      "Even without the cash to meet a high deductible, she said, the coverage can still protect people from catastrophic medical bills, such as cancer treatment or serious injuries from a car accident.",
      "\u201cThe people switching to a bronze plan this year may start to feel like they might as well be uninsured,\u201d Cox said."

    "story": [
      "For more than a decade, Oren and Tal Alexander built a luxury real estate empire, selling ultra-luxury properties across the country. But prosecutors allege that behind the scenes, the brothers and their sibling, Alon Alexander, used their influence to sexually abuse dozens of women.",
      "As their federal sex trafficking trial begins in New York, prosecutors and defense attorneys are preparing to present sharply conflicting narratives about the lives, relationships and alleged crimes of the three men.",
      "At least eight accusers are expected to testify, including a woman who was 16 at the time of her alleged assault.",
      "The brothers face sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison if convicted. All three have pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Here is what we know about the brothers and the sex trafficking case.",
      "What are they accused of?",
      "The brothers are accused in a 12-count superseding indictment of conspiring over more than a decade to drug, sexually assault and rape dozens of women, sometimes involving multiple perpetrators. Prosecutors allege the assaults were at times planned in advance, with women flown to vacation destinations under the guise of exclusive travel opportunities.",
      "Defense lawyers acknowledge that their clients had sexual encounters with some of the women involved but maintain the interactions were consensual.",
      "The brothers, who have been the subject of numerous civil lawsuits, have been held without bail since their arrests in December 2024 in Miami, where they lived. They have denied all allegations of misconduct. Many of the lawsuits are still pending.",
      "Defense attorneys have tried to have the charges dismissed, arguing that prosecutors have repeatedly altered the indictment and added new counts without giving the defense sufficient time to investigate.",
      "The most recent superseding indictment added a new charge of sexual abuse by physical incapacitation against Oren Alexander and his twin, Alon Alexander. According to prosecutors, the alleged assault of a woman who was \u201cphysically incapable of declining participation\u201d occurred around January 2012 aboard a Bahamian-flagged cruise ship that departed from and returned to the United States.",
      "During pretrial hearings, defense attorney Teny Geragos also accused prosecutors of failing to turn over evidence, including videos and photographs from witnesses and alleged co-conspirators, in a timely manner.",
      "Prosecutors said multiple FBI agents are assigned to the case and that they are producing evidence as quickly as possible. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni expressed frustration with both sides at times, noting that the Justice Department should be able to prioritize resources for the case.",
      "At one point, Caproni became exasperated during a dispute over a jury questionnaire and whether people would understand the definition of sexual assault, remarking, \u201cI think most people feel that if a guy puts his hand on a girl where she doesn\u2019t want it, that\u2019s sexual assault.\u201d",
      "Much of the pretrial litigation has also focused on whether certain accusers may testify under pseudonyms to protect their identities.",
      "Who are the Alexander brothers?",
      "Oren and Alon Alexander are 38-year-old twins, and Tal Alexander is their 39-year-old brother. Tal and Oren Alexander co-founded the real estate company Official, specializing in luxury properties in New York, Miami and Los Angeles.",
      "Alon Alexander went to law school and worked as an executive at the family\u2019s private security company.",
      "Their parents, Shlomi and Orly Alexander, have defended them, previously stating that they believe their sons are \u201cinnocent and hope that they are judged solely on the evidence presented in court, free from speculation or public narrative.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur family has been living with this ordeal since allegations first appeared in civil lawsuits and were widely publicized long before any criminal charges were filed, and the toll has been deeply painful,\u201d they said.",
      "Legal analysts have said the case presents significant challenges for prosecutors. NBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos noted that allegations of sex trafficking carry a higher burden of proof than allegations of sexual assault.",
      "\u201cAs sexual assault cases, these might be difficult for the prosecution,\u201d Cevallos said. \u201cAs sex trafficking cases, however, they are even more difficult. This case raises a thorny legal question: Is this the kind of conduct that we think of when we think of sex trafficking?\u201d",
      "He added that jurors might dismiss accusers based on their proximity to wealth and glamour. \u201cJurors should not look with skepticism at victims just because they were models living in a world of fine Champagne and yachts and international travel,\u201d Cevallos said. \u201cBut the prosecution has to be concerned that they might.\u201d"

    "summary": "Used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, the earliest known hand-held wooden tools have been uncovered by researchers in Greece.",
    "story": [
      "The earliest known hand-held wooden tools, used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, have been uncovered by researchers at an archeological site in Greece.",
      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "His post went viral and caught the attention of many, including \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show.\u201d In a clip shared Jan. 21 on the show\u2019s social media, Kortuem was invited to sit down and share his story with host Drew Barrymore before he got a surprise message from Williams.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to say thank you for watching our show and sharing your kind words you had for it,\u201d the actor said via video message. Williams added that it means a lot that the show could play a \u201csmall part in a positive thing about your life.\u201d",
      "Williams, who portrays NHL hockey player Shane in the series, also thanked Kortuem for his bravery \u201cand sounding like a really cool guy.\u201d",
      "After the message aired, a shocked Kortuem said, \u201cWow, that\u2019s incredible...I\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d",

      "Episode 5, when Scott Hunter called Kip onto the ice, Kortuem said, changed everything for him.",

      "He shared that one person already revealed to him that his post gave them the courage to have a conversation with their family \u201cand they accepted me,\u201d he said the person told him.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about giving that kid hope that doesn\u2019t think he can go on any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving that kid who\u2019s playing hockey in Fargo right now, where his teammates might be bullying him, or that collegiate athlete that thinks that they can\u2019t be gay and play this sport.

      "Here are the ones that stood out the most from this year's field. Winners will be announced at the 98th Academy Awards on March 15.",
      "Snub: 'Wicked: For Good' and Its Two Stars",
      "Apparently the Academy was done with \"Wicked\" for good after the first film of the blockbuster franchise because the sequel did not receive any nominations.",
      "Cynthia Erivo was denied a best actress nomination, while Ariana Grande was left out of the supporting actress category.",
      "As Turner Classic Movies host and Oscars expert Dave Karger noted on TODAY, \"Wicked: For Good\" also did not receive nominations in categories like costume design and production design, which it won just a year ago for the original film.",
      "Surprise: Delroy Lindo in \u2018Sinners\u2019",
      "Lindo's emotional monologue as veteran Mississippi bluesman Delta Slim is a highlight of the Michael B. Jordan-led film, and it earned Lindo the first nomination of his 50-year career.",
      "Lindo, 73, snagged a nomination for best supporting actor, riding the wave of 16 nominations for \"Sinners,\" a new Academy Award record.",
      "From his '90s performances in \"Malcolm X\" and \"Clockers\" to his portrayal of a Vietnam War vet in Spike Lee's \"Da 5 Bloods\" in 2020, the nod has been a long time coming for Lindo.",
      "Snub: Paul Mescal in \u2018Hamnet\u2019",
      "One man's surprise is another man's snub. We're pretty sure Shakespeare said that.",
      "Mescal was left out of the best supporting actor category for his affecting portrayal of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s a shame because that\u2019s a great performance, but that goes to show you how great Delroy Lindo is and also how 'Sinners' did,\" Karger said on TODAY.",
      "Mescal is a previous Oscar nominee for \"Aftersun,\" so he's already been on the Academy Award radar. The good news is he's only 29, so there's plenty of time to stack up more nominations.",
      "Surprise: Kate Hudson in 'Song Sung Blue'",
      "This marks Hudson's first nomination since her unforgettable performance as band groupie Penny Lane in \"Almost Famous\" more than 25 years ago.",
      "She was nominated for actress in a leading role after playing half of a husband-wife Neil Diamond tribute duo alongside Hugh Jackman in \"Song Sung Blue.\"",
      "Hudson, 46, becomes one of the rare actors to earn another nomination after such a long gap following the first one.",
      "Snub: Chase Infiniti in 'One Battle After Another'",
      "Infiniti made a memorable debut in a film that's considered a strong contender for best picture, but it was not enough to earn her a lead actress nomination.",
      "She was one of the few stars of \"One Battle After Another\" who didn't grab a nomination. Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, Sean Penn and director Paul Thomas Anderson were all nominated.",
      "Regardless, Infiniti has set the bar high considering \"One Battle After Another\" is the first movie she has ever done.",
      "She was nominated for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture \u2014 musical or comedy at the Golden Globes, which was won by Rose Byrne.",
      "Snub: 'Avatar: Fire and Ash'",
      "The hopes of the third installment of the \"Avatar\" series were reduced to rubble when it did not earn a best picture nomination.",
      "The first two films in the series were nominated for best picture in 2010 and 2023, respectively. Though the latest sequel has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, it was not enough to put the new story of the Na'vi in the Oscars' marquee category.",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is still up for two awards, however: costume design and visual effects.",
      "Surprise: 'F1'",
      "This year's Peak Dad Movie earned a surprising best picture nomination in a field mixed with other blockbusters like \"Sinners\" and \"Marty Supreme\" and smaller films like \"Train Dreams\" and \"The Secret Agent.\"",
      "None of the actors in \"F1\" received a nomination in any of the major categories.",
      "The Brad Pitt movie about an aging Formula One driver getting one last shot on the track didn't get the same critical reception as some of the other nominees, but its heart-pumping racing scenes were considered some of the best action on screen in 2025."

      "Kim Kardashian then went on to cite her love of country music, particularly Shania Twain, Carrie Underwood and LeAnn Rimes.",
      "Kim Kardashian's comments about Swift come 16 years after Swift's feud with Kanye West, whom Kardashian was married to from 2014 to 2022, began. \"The College Dropout\" rapper, now known as Ye, famously interrupted Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs.",
      "Though West later apologized, he got into another spat with Swift when he released his 2016 song \"Famous.\"  The two had a disagreement over whether or not Swift approved a vulgar lyric about herself in the song. To back up her then-husband, Kardashian released a video of a phone call between West and Swift that seemingly backed up his claims. The ensuing fallout led Swift to stay out of the public eye for a year. She suddenly returned to the scene with the release of  \"Reputation\" in 2017, with songs like \"Look What You Made Me Do.\"",
      "However, in 2020, a 25-minute version of the phone call was leaked, which painted a different picture.",
      "Swift addressed the phone call in a 2023 interview with Time magazine. She called it \u201ca fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.\u201d",
      "Swift again seemingly referenced their feud in her 2024 song \"thanK you aIMee,\" stylized with \"KIM\" spelled out in capital letters. The song's lyrics are about a mean girl at school named Aimee.",
      "\"All that time you were throwin\u2019 punches, I was buildin\u2019 somethin\u2019/ And I can\u2019t forgive the way you made me feel/ Screamed \u201cF--- you, Aimee\u201d to the night sky, as the blood was gushin\u2019,\" Swift sings in the chorus.",
      "Later, seemingly directly addressing the song's subject, Swift sings, \"I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve changed much/ And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues / And one day, your kid comes home singin'/ A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.\u201d"

      "\u201cFor too long, we in the West have been very predictable, and that has also been easy for someone like Vladimir Putin to then anticipate what our next moves will be,\u201d van Weel, a former assistant secretary general at NATO, told NBC News in an interview last week. Trump\u2019s unpredictability, he says, might \u201chelp.\u201d",

      "After American special forces captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, the Kremlin demanded their release and condemned what it said was an unacceptable attack on Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "But Venezuela matters to Moscow for reasons that go far beyond Maduro.",
      "For Putin, the relationship has been a way to show that Russia is still a global power, not just a country boxed in by Europe.  And under Putin\u2019s rule, Moscow has built deep energy and media ties in Caracas that helped it gain a rare foothold in America\u2019s backyard.",
      "Putin\u2019s aim has been \u201cto get out of this idea that Russia is just a regional power, trying to reinvigorate that kind of global, or larger global reach that the Soviet Union had,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council.",

      "Iran looms",

      "Trump has been contemplating military action against Tehran after its massive crackdown on opposition to the clerical regime, killing thousands of activists in the streets.",
      "Trump\u2019s plans on Iran matter to Putin because Tehran and the Kremlin have especially close ties that stretch back to the Soviet era. Iran sends drones to Russia that have been used in the war in Ukraine, while Moscow has supplied Iran with many of the weapons it has used to crush protests.",
      "\u201cPutin has a personal stake in ensuring that Iran does not fall,\u201d said Nicole Grajewski, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Paris-based think tank. \u201cIt would have a major impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran for Russia is on its southern periphery,\u201d she said in an interview. Putin deeply dislikes uprisings that overthrow leaders, she added.",

      "While India did not endorse Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it became a major buyer of Russian oil, which was discounted on global markets because of international sanctions.",
      "Trump has retaliated to India\u2019s moves with secondary sanctions and threats of steep tariffs, among them a proposed 25% levy aimed at countries buying Russian crude.",
      "That squeezes Moscow, but it also hurts New Delhi.",
      "\u201cPutin probably loves the fact that Indians think of this 25% tariff as a U.S. sanction on India,\u201d said Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cSo Russia uses this to say, \u2018Look, the U.S. and Europe are not your friends. They are sanctioning you. They are not reliable.\u2019\u201d",

      "Trump has offered Putin possible wins on the world stage, for example with an invitation to the Board of Peace. Putin is not the only autocrat to have been invited to join the organization inaugurated Thursday in the Swiss city of Davos, but he is possibly its most controversial: Britain and France cited the Russian leader\u2019s participation in the organization as one of the reasons for not joining last week, among other concerns.",
      "\u201cPutin certainly is not a person to ask any questions about peace,\u201d Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview this week.",
      "Aside from invading Ukraine, Putin has crushed free speech and political dissent within Russia.  The West, led by the U.S., should be exerting more pressure on Russia, Valtonen added.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cI am a little bit fearful also of a future in which we try to rehabilitate Russia and Putin to the world community, especially if there were significant trade deals or the lifting of economic sanctions towards Russia because, unfortunately, Russia\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t begin or it doesn\u2019t end in Ukraine,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked for comment on Monday, the White House directed NBC News to an earlier Trump statement about Putin joining the board \u201cWe want everybody. We want all nations. We want all nations where people have control, power,\u201d he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cThat way we\u2019re not ever going to have a problem.\u201d",
      "But Putin himself may have mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s apparently friendly invitation to join what has been described as an alternative to the United Nations since Russia has a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council. In contrast, the charter of the Board of Peace spells out that one person is fundamentally in charge: Trump, as chairman with a veto."

      "While the deal marks a major victory for the country\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, it has been a brutal blow to the fighters, who are mainly ethnic Kurds.",
      "Many Kurds have been left shell-shocked by the fighting with Syrian forces, the rapid shift in the balance of power and the loss of territory, with some saying they felt bereft after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces\u2019 (SDF) had made sweeping contributions in the fight against ISIS.",
      "\u201cEveryone has abandoned us,\u201d Saleh al-Ali, a resident of Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in the Ayn al-Arab district in northern Syria, told NBC News this week.",
      "Al-Ali, who said he works at a poultry farm in the Hasakah countryside, said he had traveled with his wife, their three young daughters and his ailing mother to the area about a week ago when clashes broke out between Syrian government forces and the SDF. The family tried to return to Kobani, but the roads were cut off, forcing them to flee for safety toward Qamishli.",
      "\u201cWe used to feel safe with the American military presence in northeast Syria,\u201d said al-Ali, 41. \u201cWe believed they were our guarantee and would never abandon us \u2014 especially after we sacrificed tens of thousands of our young people fighting alongside them against ISIS and helping rebuild what ISIS had destroyed.\u201d",
      "Syria\u2019s new leadership has struggled to consolidate authority in the war-ravaged country since the toppling of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in December 2024, led by al-Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. While al-Sharaa has vowed to build a more unified and representative Syria, his rule has struggled with deep divisions and deadly sectarian clashes across the country.",
      "In a recent push, Syrian forces gained control over the Deir al-Zour and Raqqa provinces, plus parts of Hasakah province, with the SDF further announcing its withdrawal from al-Hol camp, where thousands of people with alleged links to ISIS are held, as Syrian government forces advanced into Hasakah."

      "Major Western allies chose to skip the ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with some voicing concerns that the body, which Trump plans to chair personally, could replace the United Nations.",
      "Trump, who has derided the U.N. for \"empty words\" that \u201cdon\u2019t solve war,\u201d said Thursday that the two bodies will work alongside each other, after having suggested earlier in the week that the board \"might\" replace it.",
      "With many allies absent, Trump was flanked at the event by leaders and representatives from Argentina, Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Qatar, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Morocco, Paraguay and Pakistan.",

      "In a message addressed to Carney on Truth Social late Thursday, Trump announced \"the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada\u2019s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "What is the Board of Peace?",
      "Trump first proposed the Board of Peace as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but it has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.",
      "In November, the U.N. Security Council approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan that included establishing a security force in Gaza.",
      "The current charter for the board, as confirmed by NBC News, makes no direct mention of Gaza and proposes a broad mandate for a new international organization that \u201cseeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.\u201d",

      "Who is part of the Board of Peace?",

      "Trump said his board would work alongside the U.N., which he said has \"got tremendous potential.\" The two bodies together \"can be something very, very unique for the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Rubio thanked the world leaders present and expressed hope that those who might have reservations will ultimately join.",
      "\"Others will join,\" he said. \"Many want to be a part of this effort, because it is going to be a successful effort.\"",
      "Rubio said the body would be about \"action\" and not just \"strongly worded statements\" the world is used to from global leaders.",
      "\"We often find ourselves at events where people are reading these scripted statements, these strongly worded letters that they put out, but no action. Nothing happens,\" he said.",
      "Who isn't joining?",
      "The U.K., France, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia are among the countries to indicate they would not immediately be joining the body.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said this week that the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper cited concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's possible participation.",
      "In an interview with the BBC on Thursday morning, she said, \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we are still not seeing any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"",

      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

      "The Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, was under investigation and accused of serious \u201cviolations of discipline and law.\u201d",
      "Liu Zhenli, another People\u2019s Liberation Army general and a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the Joint Staff Department, was also put under investigation, the ministry said.",
      "The statement gave no details about the allegations or the charges they faced. An editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that that had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. The page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",
      "Zhang was previously considered \u201cuntouchable,\u201d according to Alessandro Arduino, an expert in Chinese security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a reminder coming directly from President Xi Jinping that political loyalty stands well before combat readiness,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cPolitical disloyalty is a cardinal sin inside the party. And the message is clear: It\u2019s a political accusation. I think the message is extremely clear: No one is safe.\u201d",
      "Xi could have let Zhang, 75, retire to save face, he said, adding that that was \u201cvery important in China.\u201d Instead, Xi had allowed \u201ca huge political accusation\u201d to be leveled against his longtime ally, Arduino said.",
      "China\u2019s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge in recent years, in which People\u2019s Liberation Army generals, admirals, government ministers and other officials have been removed from their posts.",
      "Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has launched a variety of anti-corruption drives through various government departments.",
      "More recently the focus has been on the armed forces. In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But some analysts see the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran of China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, as the most significant ouster yet, one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "\u201cThis is really almost Shakespearean,\" said Jonathan Czin, a former senior CIA analyst who focused on China and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.",
      "He added, \"This is somebody that Xi has had a decadeslong relationship with.\u201d",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing Xi to consolidate power but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",
      "Xi has long harbored ambitions of reuniting Taiwan, the self-ruled territory of 23 million people, with China, and his military regularly launches live-fire drills around the island, featuring aircraft and warships.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Officials in Taipei are closely watching what they have called \u201cabnormal\u201d changes to China\u2019s military leadership and will use a range of methods to decipher Beijing\u2019s intentions, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Monday.",
      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",
      "Arduino of the Royal United Services Institute echoed that view, saying Zhang was one of the oldest high-ranking commanders who fought in the war against Vietnam, \u201cso he knows very well what it means to wage a war, compared to the majority of the PLA that are just training to be combat ready.\u201d",
      "His successor \u201cwill show what is going to look like a PLA that is first and foremost politically aligned with the party and, by definition, with President Xi himself,\u201d he said.",

      "Stay present for each move at a time, over and over. That\u2019s how Alex Honnold describes the challenge of ascending one of the world's tallest buildings without any ropes or nets.",
      "\u201cI kind of lost track of space and time to some extent,\u201d Honnold, the American rock climber, told NBC News' \"TODAY\" show in an interview after he climbed the famous Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt feels infinite,\u201d he said of the tower, which is 1,667 feet tall. \u201cWhen you look up, all you can see is building as far as you go, and so it just keeps going forever.\u201d",
      "Honnold gained world-wide fame when he ascended Yosemite National Park\u2019s 3,000-foot El Capitan without safety equipment or rope in 2017.",
      "He said that far from strain as he got closer to the top of the Taipei skyscraper, climbing the final section felt like a \u201cvictory lap.\u201d",
      "It gets a little easier toward the very top, he said, \u201cwhere you can really savor the view and appreciate the position.\u201d",
      "And what a view it was.",
      "Taipei 101 towers over the capital of Taiwan, its steel-and-glass stature having become synonymous with the city.",
      "It was the tallest building in the world from 2004 to 2010, a title currently held by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.",
      "Thousands of nervous fans and members of the media were watching Honnold\u2019s \u201cfree solo\u201d climb and cheering him on late Saturday as his red-shirt silhouette got smaller and smaller on his way up.",
      "Some fans cheered him on from inside the building, holding up motivational banners in the windows to keep Honnold going. He had to postpone his climb Saturday because of rainy conditions.",
      "\u201cSick,\u201d Honnold said as he stood at the top spire of the building and waved his arms to those watching below. The event was livestreamed on Netflix with a 10-second delay so the public could closely follow his daring leaps and no-hands holds. The live broadcast of a potentially life-threatening stunt has drawn both excitement and concerns over its ethical implications.",
      "It took Honnold just over 1\u00bd hours to complete his 101-story climb. Reaching the summit of the building and standing at the top was not scary, he said.",
      "\u201cThat was a lot less scary to stand on the top of the building than it is to climb the side of the building,\u201d he said. He even had time to take a historic selfie at the summit.",
      "Honnold had the extra challenge of windy conditions on the corner he was climbing.",
      "He also had to scale the building\u2019s overhanging structures that resemble \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d on his way up. \u201cBecause it overhangs, it\u2019s more physically demanding. It\u2019s just a little bit tiring. And it\u2019s just, yes, the hardest moves on the climb,\u201d Honnold said."

      "The report comes as Trump struggles to bring an end to a war he repeatedly said he could end on the first day of his second term, or even before he took office.

      "The trilateral meeting was \u201ca step\u201d toward ending the war, Zelenskyy said, adding: \u201cWe are not standing still.\u201d",
      "But Ushakov reiterated after the meeting at the Kremlin that Putin\u2019s territorial demands remain the same, and that without resolving the territorial issue, \u201cthere is no hope of achieving a long-term settlement.\u201d",
      "Asked if Russia wants full control over the Donbas, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cRussia\u2019s position is well known \u2014 Ukraine and the Ukrainian Armed Forces must leave the territory of Donbas and withdraw from there. This is a very important condition. There are also other nuances that remain on the negotiating agenda.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously pushed of the idea of a free economic zone in the Donbas.",
      "Asked if the trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi could lead to a trilateral meeting between Putin, Zelenskyy and himself, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One late Thursday: \"Anytime we meet is good. If you don\u2019t meet, nothing is going to happen.\"",
      "He said he expects Putin to make concessions, because \"everybody\u2019s making concessions to get it done.\" Both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders want a deal, Trump added.",
      "Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian delegation will feature his top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, and his new Chief of Staff Kyrylo Budanov.",

      "Ushakov said Friday's three-way talks will focus on \u201csecurity issues,\u201d and said the Russian delegation there will thus be led by  by the chief of military intelligence, Adm. Igor Kostyukov. Putin\u2019s economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev will separately meet with Witkoff, he said.",

      "Tehran on Friday dismissed as \"completely false\" Trump's repeated suggestion that his threats had halted the planned executions of more than 800 protesters. Trump had said that such killings would be a trigger for him to launch military action.",
      "\"I said, 'If you hang those people, you\u2019re going to be hit harder than you\u2019ve ever been hit,'\" he told reporters on Air Force One as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"And an hour before this horrible\" event, they canceled it, he said. \"That was a good sign.\"",
