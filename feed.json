      "\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to sing it forever. I think it\u2019s Bellini\u2019s best work,\u201d Oropesa said. \u201cI find `Puritani\u2019 is one of the exceptions to the bel canto generalization of: it\u2019s boring, it\u2019s slow, it\u2019s all about the singers, the text is terrible, the stories are stupid.\u201d",
      "Oropesa was a winner at the 2005 Met National Council Auditions, joined the company\u2019s young artists program and made her Met debut a year later in Mozart\u2019s \u201cIdomeneo.\u201d Among her first larger roles was in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Rondine\u201d on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2008, when she sang the character named Lisette under the baton of Marco Armiliato, also this season\u2019s \u201cPuritani\u201d conductor.",

      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",

Beneath a photo of him holding his bride, Samantha Leonard, 28, he wrote the caption, \u201ctougher than the rest,\u201d a reference to the Bruce Springsteen song of the same name. In the next slide of the two-frame carousel, Bryan shared a short clip of him covering the song.",
      "It is unclear when the couple started dating or got engaged. Rumors of their relationship hit social media in August, when Leonard posted a picture of the pair embracing on a boat on her official Instagram account.",
      "Bryan shared a tribute to Leonard on his Instagram account a few months later, in October, writing, \u201cToday is your birthday and I love you, Samantha Marie. To the only woman who can hike six miles in Chanel flats, skydive over the alps and catch a bigger fish than me all in the same day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHope your day was as graceful as you are.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",
      "France today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.",

      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "U.S. health officials have made unprecedented changes to childhood vaccine recommendations, alarming pediatricians and other medical experts",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials made broad changes to childhood vaccine recommendations Monday, alarming pediatricians and other medical experts who say they will sow confusion and undermine children's health.",
      "The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases, down from 18 a year ago.",
      "The changes comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the changes:",
      "Once broadly recommended, the federal government now only recommends protection against these diseases for certain children at high risk or based on individual doctor advice in what\u2019s called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",

      "\u2014 Hib, or Haemophilus influenzae type B, bacteria that despite the name isn't related to flu",
      "\u2014 PCV or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "However, many European countries recommend some of the vaccines the U.S. removed from its list.",
      "The nation's large doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they will continue to recommend the vaccines that the Trump administration has now demoted. They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own child vaccine recommendations. Also, states, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",
      "If the changes mean fewer children are vaccinated, outbreaks that have historically been prevented by high vaccination rates could spread more widely, leading to more disease and more missed school and work.",
      "The Trump administration said coverage will continue for families that still want the shots. Health insurers generally find vaccination a good deal, as shots are cheaper than hospitalizations, and many had previously said they'd planned to cover what was recommended last year through 2026.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday closed out the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year by denouncing today's consumerist and anti-foreigner sentiment, capping a Jubilee that saw some 33 million pilgrims flock to Rome and a historic transition from one American pontiff to another.",
      "With cardinals and diplomats looking on, Leo kneeled down in prayer on the stone floor at the threshold of the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. He then stood up and pulled the two doors shut, symbolically concluding the rarest of Jubilees: one that was opened by a feeble Pope Francis in December 2024, continued during his funeral and the conclave, and then was closed by Francis' successor a year later.",
      "Only once before, in 1700, has a Holy Year been opened by one pope and closed by another.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony, at the start of Mass celebrating the feast of Epiphany, capped a dizzying year of special audiences, Masses and meetings that dominated Leo\u2019s first months as pontiff and in many ways put his own agenda on hold.",
      "As if to signal his pontificate now can begin in earnest, Leo has summoned the world\u2019s cardinals to the Vatican for two days of meetings starting Wednesday to discuss governing the 1.4-billion strong Catholic Church. On the agenda is the issue of the liturgy, suggesting Leo is diving head-first into the divisions within the church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass.",
      "In his homily Tuesday, Leo said the Jubilee year had invited all Christians to reflect on the Biblical teachings to welcome the stranger and resist \u201cthe flattery and seduction of those in power.\u201d",
      "\u201cAround us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us ask ourselves: has the Jubilee taught us to flee from this type of efficiency that reduces everything to a product and human beings to consumers? After this year, will we be better able to recognize a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbor in the foreigner, and fellow travelers in those who are different?\u201d",
      "He echoed the theme in a special Epiphany prayer delivered from the basilica loggia to a rain-soaked piazza below. As thousands of people huddled under colorful umbrellas and ponchos, Leo recalled that traditionally Jubilees have included appeals for peace and \u201ca redistribution of the land and its resources\u201d to those in need.",
      "\u201cIn the place of inequality, may there be fairness, and may the industry of war be replaced by the craft of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "For the Vatican, a Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receive indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins if they pass through the Holy Door.",
      "For Rome, it\u2019s a chance to take advantage of public funds, in this case some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion), to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards.",

      "\u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said Monday that Greenland should be part of the United States in spite of a warning by Frederiksen that a U.S. takeover of Greenland would amount to the end of NATO.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear for months now that the United States should be the nation that has Greenland as part of our overall security apparatus,\u201d Miller said during an interview with CNN Monday afternoon.",
      "His comments came after the Danish leader, together with Greenland\u2019s prime minister and other European leaders, firmly rejected Trump\u2019s renewed call for the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island to come under U.S. control in the aftermath of the weekend U.S. military operation in Venezuela.",

But U.S. President Donald Trump delivered them a heavy blow by allowing Maduro\u2019s vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, to assume control.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog said Wednesday it is scrapping the safety screening for two reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear power plant in central Japan after the plant's operator was found to have fabricated data about earthquake risks, in a setback to Japan's attempts to accelerate reactor restarts to boost nuclear energy use.",
      "Chubu Electric Power Co. had applied for safety screening to resume operations at the No. 3 and 4 reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear power plant in 2014 and 2015. Two other reactors at the plant are being decommissioned, and a fifth is idle.",
      "The plant, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Tokyo, is located on a coastal area known for potential risks from so-called Nankai Trough megaquakes.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said it started an internal investigation in February after receiving a tip from a whistleblower that the utility had for years provided fabricated data that underestimated potential seismic risks.",
      "The regulator suspended the screening for the reactors after it confirmed the falsification and the utility acknowledged the fabrication in mid-December, said Shinsuke Yamanaka, the watchdog's chair. The NRA is also considering inspecting the utility headquarters.",
      "\u201cEnsuring safety is the first and foremost responsibility for nuclear plant operators and (data fabrication) is an act of betrayal to their task and one that destroys nuclear safety,\" Yamanaka said.",
      "The scandal surfaced Monday when Chubu Electric President Kingo Hayashi acknowledged that workers at the utility used inappropriate seismic data with an alleged intention to underestimate seismic risks and apologized. He pledged to establish an independent panel for investigation.",

      "As Iran is gripped by new protests, many people there are focused on the U.S. raid in Venezuela and wonder whether the same could occur in Tehran",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran faces a new round of protests challenging the country's theocracy, but it seems like the only thing people there want to talk about is half a world away: Venezuela.",
      "Since the U.S. military seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend, Iranian state media headlines and officials have condemned the operation. In the streets and even in some official conversations, however, there's a growing question over whether a similar mission could target the Islamic Republic's top officials including the supreme leader, 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The paranoia feeds into wider worries among Iranians. Many fear that close U.S. ally Israel will target Iran again as it did during the 12-day war it launched against Tehran in June. Israel killed a slew of top military officials and nuclear scientists, and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. Khamenei is believed to have gone into hiding for his protection.",
      "\u201cGod bless our leader, we should be careful too,\" said Saeed Seyyedi, a 57-year-old teacher in Tehran, worried the U.S. could act as it did in Venezuela.",
      "\"The U.S. has always been after plots against Iran, especially when issues like oil, Israel are part of the case. In addition, it can be complicated when it is mixed with the Russia-Ukraine war, the Lebanese (group) Hezbollah and drug accusations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. long has accused the Iranian-backed Hezbollah of running drug-smuggling operations to fund its operations, including in Latin America, which the group denies.",
      "Immediately after Maduro\u2019s seizure, an analyst on Iranian state television claimed, without offering evidence, that the U.S. and Israel had plans during the war last year to kidnap Iranian officials with a team of dual-national Iranians. Even for conspiracy-minded Iranian television, airing such a claim is unusual.",
      "Then on Sunday night, the prominent Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Javedan warned an audience at prayers in Tehran University that Khamenei's life was in danger.",
      "\u201cSomeone said he had a bad dream that the leader\u2019s life is in danger,\" Javedan said, without elaborating. \"Please pray.\u201d",
      "However, Iran is roughly twice the size of Venezuela and has what analysts consider to be a much stronger military and robust security forces. The memory of Operation Eagle Claw, a failed U.S. special forces mission to rescue hostages held after the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran, also haunts Washington.",
      "Then there's the political situation in Iran, with its theocracy protected by hard-liners within the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, who answer only to Khamenei. They could launch assassinations, cyberattacks and assaults on shipping in the Mideast, warned Farzin Nadimi, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who studies Iran\u2019s military.",
      "And crucially, Iran also still has fissile nuclear material.",
      "\u201cIn the grand-strategy scheme of things, they need to think about the day after,\u201d Nadimi said of anyone considering a Venezuela-style raid. \u201cIran is a much more complex political situation. They have to calculate the costs and benefits.\u201d",

      "Uganda is preparing for a election in an atmosphere of political violence",
      "WAKISO, Uganda -- The Ugandan presidential candidate known as Bobi Wine wears a flak jacket and helmet while campaigning to protect himself from gunfire. But the safety gear offers no protection from the stinging clouds of tear gas that often follow him on the campaign trail.",
      "Wine is challenging President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986 by repeatedly rewriting the rules to stay in power. Term and age limits have been scrapped, rivals jailed or sidelined, and state security forces are a constant presence at opposition rallies as Museveni seeks a seventh term in elections on Jan. 15.",
      "Wine, a musician-turned-politician whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, faced similar setbacks in 2021, when he first ran for president. He was often roughed up by the police, clothes ripped from his body, and dozens of his supporters were jailed.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, he charged that this time \u201cthe military has largely taken over the election\u201d and that at least three of his supporters have been killed in violent campaign events.",
      "\u201cIt has been very violent. There\u2019s been a lot of impunity to the extent that we are denied the right to use the public roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hounded by security and followed by over 40 police and military cars. Everywhere I go to campaign, (the) day before, the military comes, beats up people, intimidates them, warns them against attending the rallies I address.\u201d",
      "The human rights group Amnesty International says the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings and other acts of violence amount to \u201ca brutal campaign of repression\u201d ahead of the vote.",
      "In a New Year's Eve address, the president said he recommended that the security forces use more tear gas to break up crowds of what he called \u201cthe criminal opposition.\"",
      "\u201cUsing tear gas for rioters is both legal and non-lethal,\u201d Museveni said in a televised speech. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t kill. It is much better than using live bullets.\u201d",
      "Security forces, notably the military, have repeatedly broken up Wine's campaign rallies, sending his supporters scampering into ditches and swamps.",
      "Critics note that Museveni, in contrast, campaigns without disruption and can go wherever he wants. Some charge that the election is simply a ritual to keep Museveni in power, not a fair exercise that could possibly lead to a change of government in the east African nation of 45 million.",
      "Wine, the most prominent of seven opposition candidates, has urged supporters to show courage before the security forces, although he has not called outright for protests. He said he wants his supporters to cast \u201cprotest votes\u201d in large numbers against Museveni's party on election day.",
      "In his interview with the AP, Wine cited at least three deaths at his rallies, including a man shot by the military and another run over by a military truck. The offenses can go unpunished because the electoral authorities, the police and the army \u201cserve the sitting government,\u201d he said. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said he was not aware of the alleged incidents.",
      "Museveni is the third-longest-serving leader in Africa. Now he seeks to extend his rule into a fifth decade.",
      "He first took power by force as the leader of a guerrilla army that said it wanted to restore democracy after a period of civil war and the cruel dictatorship of Idi Amin.",
      "Decades ago, Museveni criticized African leaders who overstayed their time in power. Years later, Ugandan lawmakers did the same thing for him when they jettisoned the last constitutional obstacle \u2014 age limits \u2014 for a possible life presidency.",
      "His son, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has asserted his wish to succeed his father, raising fears of hereditary rule as Museveni has no recognizable successor in the upper ranks of the ruling party, the National Resistance Movement.",

      "Besigye was Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition leader before the rise of Wine, 43, who presents a different challenge for Museveni as the face of youthful hope for change. Wine has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as a serious challenger for power.",
      "Yet Museveni dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and questions his patriotism. \u201cMr. Kyagulanyi and his evil foreigners that back him fail to understand that Uganda is a land of spiritual and political martyrs,\u201d Museveni said in his New Year\u2019s Eve address.",

      "Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy have conducted a sit-in at Tehran's Grand Bazaar",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Protesters angry over Iran's ailing economy conducted a sit-in Tuesday at Tehran's Grand Bazaar, witnesses said, with security forces ultimately firing tear gas and dispersing demonstrators as the rest of the market shut down.",
      "The protest at the Grand Bazaar, the beating heart for centuries of both Iran's economic and political life, represents the latest signal that the demonstrations likely are to continue as the country's rial currency fell to a record low Tuesday. Already, violence surrounding the protests has killed at least 35 people with authorities detaining more than 1,200 others, activists abroad say.",
      "Meanwhile, the situation is likely to worsen as Iran's Central Bank drastically reduced the subsidized exchange rates for dollars it offers to importers and producers in the country. That likely will see merchants pass on price hikes in the coming days for goods directly onto consumers, whose life savings already have dwindled over years of international sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, while ordering a government investigation into one incident involving the protests, otherwise signaled Tuesday the crisis may be rapidly moving beyond the control of officials.",
      "\u201cWe should not expect the government to handle all of this alone,\" Pezeshkian said in a televised speech. \"The government simply does not have that capacity.\u201d",
      "In the Grand Bazaar, a labyrinth-like warren of covered passages and alleyways, demonstrators sat down in one passage in front of security forces as other shops nearby shut down on Tuesday, online videos showed and witnesses said. Other demonstrations similarly have seen people sit down in front of police after a photo circulated earlier of a man seen sitting alone in front of security forces.",
      "Authorities later fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. Iranian state-run media did not immediately acknowledge the incident, which has been common in the days since the demonstrations began on Dec. 28.",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after a 12-day war with Israel in June, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "On Tuesday, $1 traded at 1.46 million rials, a new low, with no signs of slowing. Prior to Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials.",
      "More pain may be coming for Iranian consumers. Iran\u2019s Central Bank in recent days greatly reduced a preferential, subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate. Iran\u2019s government offer that rate to importers and producers to try to ensure the flow of food, medicine and other essential goods despite international sanctions over its nuclear program and other issues.",
      "However, many of those firms took advantage of the difference in rates, pocketing ever-greater profits as normal Iranians watched their savings rapidly lose value against the dollar. That's led to the Central Bank drastically reducing that rate.",
      "The currency and rate depreciation has directly impacted what's available in stores \u2014 and at what price. The average bottle of cooking oil just doubled in price, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Many have complained about shelves being empty in stores, likely as suppliers and merchants fear selling cooking oil at a loss. Cheese and chicken prices also spiked, while imported rice hasn't been available in some shops.",
      "Pezeshkian in his speech blamed inflation, sanctions and other woes for causing the depreciation \u2014 and warned tougher times may be coming.",

      "While it remains unclear how and if Trump will intervene, his comments sparked an immediate, angry response, with officials within the theocracy threatening to target American troops in the Mideast. The comments took on new importance after the U.S. military on Saturday captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.",

      "Warner Bros",
      "NEW YORK -- Warner Bros. again rejected a takeover bid from Paramount and told shareholders Wednesday to stick with a rival offer from Netflix.",
      "Warner\u2019s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed Skydance-owned Paramount\u2019s overtures \u2014 and urged shareholders just weeks ago to back its the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount\u2019s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.",
      "\u201cParamount\u2019s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,\" Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. In contrast, he added, the company's agreement with Netflix \u201cwill offer superior value at greater levels of certainty.\u201d",
      "Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's hostile bid is still on the table. Warner shareholders currently have until Jan. 21 to \u201ctender\u201d their shares.",
      "Late last month, Paramount announced an \u201cirrevocable personal guarantee\u201d from Oracle founder Larry Ellison \u2014 who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison \u2014 to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company\u2019s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching Netflix's breakup fee.",
      "In its Wednesday letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. Warner said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and also pointed to operating restrictions that it said were imposed by Paramount's offer and could \u201champer WBD\u2019s ability to perform\u201d throughout a transaction.",

But Paramount wants the entire company \u2014 which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.",

      "A merger with either company could take over a year to close \u2014 and will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny along the way.

Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger. And politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.",

The group said its concerns were \u201cno less serious\u201d for Paramount's bid \u2014 warning of consequences of further consolidation overall, which it said could result in job losses and less diversity in filmmaking.",

      "The plan includes three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity.",
      "Denmark\u2019s Joint Arctic Command is headquartered in Nuuk, and tasked with the \u201csurveillance, assertion of sovereignty and military defense of Greenland and the Faroe Islands,\u201d according to its website. It has smaller satellite stations across the island.",
      "The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite Danish naval unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance and enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness, is also stationed in Greenland.",
      "Greenland is also a rich source of the so-called rare earth minerals that are a key component of cellphones, computers, batteries and other high-tech gadgets that are expected to power the world\u2019s economy in the coming decades.",
      "That has attracted the interest of the U.S. and other Western powers as they try to ease China\u2019s dominance of the market for these critical minerals.",
      "Development of Greenland\u2019s mineral resources is challenging because of the island\u2019s harsh climate, while strict environmental controls have proved an additional hurdle for potential investors.",

      "News organizations got a rare \u201cthank you\u201d from the Trump administration for not putting its military action in Venezuela in jeopardy by reporting on it before it happened",
      "In the wake of last weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela, the news media got something it has seldom heard from the Trump administration: a \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited news organizations that had learned in advance about Saturday's strike that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with not putting the mission in jeopardy by publicly reporting on it before it happened.",
      "Rubio's acknowledgment was particularly noteworthy because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cited a mistrust of journalists' ability to responsibly handle sensitive information as one of the chief reasons for imposing restrictive new press rules on Pentagon reporters. Most mainstream news organizations have left posts in the Pentagon rather than agree to Hegseth's policy.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Rubio said the Republican administration withheld information about the mission from Congress ahead of time because \u201cit will leak. It's as simple as that.\u201d But the primary reason was operational security, he said.",
      "\u201cFrankly, a number of media outlets had gotten leaks that this was coming and held it for that very reason,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd we thank them for doing that or lives could have been lost. American lives.\u201d",
      "Semafor, citing \u201cpeople familiar with communications between the administration and news organizations,\u201d reported that The New York Times and The Washington Post had both learned of the raid in advance but held off reporting on it to avoid endangering U.S. military personnel. Representatives for both outlets declined to comment to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Withholding information on a planned mission for that reason is routine for news organizations, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at the Post who now teaches at the University of Maryland. Even after the fact, the Post has asked government authorities about whether revealing certain details could endanger people, she said.",
      "When The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in a text chain last spring where Hegseth revealed information about a military attack in Yemen, the journalist did not report on the events until well after U.S. personnel was out of danger and the information had been thoroughly checked out.",
      "Most Americans learned of the Venezuela attack in the predawn hours of Saturday when President Donald Trump announced it on his Truth Social platform upon completion.",
      "While The Associated Press did not have advance word that the operation would happen, its journalists in Venezuela heard and observed explosions taking place there, and that was reported on the news wire more than two hours before Trump's announcement. The U.S. involvement was not made clear until Trump's post, however.",
      "Hegseth, in defending rules that restrict reporters' movements and reporting in the Pentagon, told Fox News last year that \u201cwe have expectations that you're not soliciting classified or sensitive information.\u201d The Times last month filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rules.",

      "Decisions on whether to report information that could put lives or a mission in danger often involve high-level discussions between editors and government officials. But Priest stressed that in a country with freedom of the press, the ultimate decision on whether to report the information lies with the news organization.",
      "Generations ago, President John F. Kennedy persuaded editors at the Times not to report when it learned in advance of a U.S.-backed attack by Cuban exiles on Fidel Castro\u2019s forces at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The mission proved a monumental failure, and a Times editor, Bill Keller, later said that Kennedy expressed regret that the newspaper had not reported on what it had known because it could have prevented a fiasco.",
      "Many mainstream journalists covering the military and national security have extensive experience dealing with sensitive issues, Priest said. But there's a difference, she said, between reporting information that could put someone in danger and that which could prove embarrassing to an administration.",
      "\u201cThe reporters are not going to be deterred by a ridiculously broad censorship edict by the Trump administration,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey're going to dig in and work even harder. Their mission is not to curry favor with the Trump administration. It's to report information to the public.\u201d",

      "A year after devastating fires in the L",
      "LOS ANGELES -- On the first anniversary of the most destructive wildfires in the L.A. area, the scant home construction projects stand out among the still mostly flattened landscapes.",
      "Fewer than a dozen homes have been rebuilt in Los Angeles County since Jan. 7, 2025, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted, killing 31 people and destroying about 13,000 homes and other residential properties.",
      "For those who had insurance, it\u2019s often not enough to cover the costs of construction. Relief organizations are stepping in to help, but progress is slow.",
      "Among the exceptions is Ted Koerner, whose Altadena home was reduced to ash and two chimneys. With his insurance payout tied up, the 67-year-old liquidated about 80% of his retirement holdings, secured contractors quickly, and moved decisively through the rebuilding process.",
      "Shortly before Thanksgiving, Koerner was among the first to finish a rebuild in the aftermath of the fires, which were fueled by drought and hurricane-force winds.",
      "But most do not have options like Koerner.",
      "The streets of the coastal community of Pacific Palisades and Altadena, a community in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, remain lined with dirt lots. In the seaside city of Malibu, foundations and concrete piles rising out of the sand are all that\u2019s left of beachfront homes that once butted against crashing ocean waves.",
      "Neighborhoods are pitch black at night, with few streetlamps replaced. Even many homes that survived are not inhabited as families struggle to clear them of the fire\u2019s toxic contaminants.",
      "Koerner was driven in part by fear that his beloved golden retriever, Daisy Mae, now 13 years old, might not live long enough to move into a new home, given the many months it can take to build even under the best circumstances.",
      "He also did not have to wait for his insurance payout to start construction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we were going to get it done before all of a sudden my dog starts having labored breathing or something else happens,\u201d Koerner said.",
      "Once construction began, his home was completed in just over four months.",
      "Daisy Mae is back lying in her favorite spot in the yard under a 175-year-old Heritage Oak. Koerner said he enjoys his morning coffee while watching her and it brings tears to his eyes.",
      "\u201cWe made it,\u201d he said.",
      "About 900 homes are under construction, potentially on pace to be completed later this year.",
      "Still, many homeowners are stuck as they figure out whether they can pay for the rebuilding process.",
      "Scores of residents have left their communities for good. More than 600 properties where a single-family home was destroyed in the wildfires have been sold, according to real estate data tracker Cotality.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge gaps between the money insurance is paying out, to the extent we have insurance, and what it will actually cost to rebuild and/or remediate our homes,\u201d said Joy Chen, executive director of the Eaton Fire Survivors Network, a group of 10,000 fire survivors mostly from Altadena.",
      "By December, less than 20% of people who experienced total home loss had closed out their insurance claims, according to a survey by the nonprofit Department of Angels.",

They reported high rates of dissatisfaction with both, citing burdensome requirements, lowball estimates, and dealing with multiple adjusters.",
      "In November, Los Angeles County opened a civil investigation into State Farm\u2019s practices and potential violations of the state\u2019s Unfair Competition law. Chen said the group has seen a flurry of substantial payouts since then.",

      "She is still weighing how she\u2019ll cover the remaining costs and says she wonders: \u201cDo I empty out my 401(k) and start counting every penny in a penny jar around the apartment?\u201d",
      "Rogers \u2014 now executive director of the Pacific Palisades Long Term Recovery Group \u2014 estimates there are hundreds like her in Pacific Palisades who are \u201cstuck dealing with FEMA and SBA and figuring out if we could piecemeal something together to build our homes.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what people talk about, but it is incredibly apparent and very real,\u201d said Rogers, who still finds herself crying at unexpected moments.",
      "That so few homes have been rebuilt a year after the wildfires echoes the recovery pattern of a December 2021 blaze that erupted south of Boulder, Colorado, destroying more than 1,000 homes.",
      "\u201cAt the one-year mark, many lots had been cleared of debris and many residents had applied for building permits, said Andrew Rumbach, co-lead of the Climate and Communities Program at Urban Institute. \u201cAround the 18-month mark is when you start to see really significant progress in terms of going from handfuls to hundreds\u201d of homes rebuilt.",
      "Time will bring the scope of problems into focus.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to start to see some real inequality start to emerge where certain neighborhoods, certain types of people, certain types of properties are just lagging way far behind, and that becomes the really important question in the second year of a recovery: Who\u2019s doing well and who is really struggling and why?\u201d Rumbach said.",
      "That\u2019s a key concern in Altadena, which for decades drew aspiring Black homeowners who otherwise faced redlining and other forms of racial discrimination when they sought to buy a home in other L.A.-area communities. In 2024, 81% of Black households in Altadena owned their homes, nearly twice the national Black homeownership rate.",
      "But recent research by UCLA\u2019s Latino Policy & Politics Institute found that, as of August, 7 in 10 Altadena homeowners whose property was severely damaged in last year\u2019s wildfire had not begun taking steps to rebuild or sell their home. Among these, Black homeowners were 73% more likely than others to have taken no action.",
      "Al and Charlotte Bailey have been living in an RV parked on the empty lot where their home once stood.",
      "The Baileys are paying for their rebuild with funds from their insurance payout and a loan. They\u2019re also hoping to receive money from Southern California Edison. Several lawsuits claim its equipmentsparked the wildfire in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe had been here for 41 years and raised our family here, and in one night it was all gone,\u201d said Al Bailey, 77. \u201cWe decided that, whatever it\u2019s going to cost, this is our community.\"",

      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, Venezuela's interim president, has risen to prominence through strategic moves and political savvy",
      "MIAMI -- In 2017, as political outsider Donald Trump headed to Washington, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez spotted an opening.",
      "Then Venezuela's foreign minister, Rodr\u00edguez directed Citgo \u2014 a subsidiary of the state oil company \u2014 to make a $500,000 donation to the president's inauguration. With the socialist administration of Nicolas Maduro struggling to feed Venezuela, Rodr\u00edguez gambled on a deal that would have opened the door to American investment. Around the same time, she saw that Trump's ex-campaign manager was hired as a lobbyist for Citgo, courted Republicans in Congress and tried to secure a meeting with the head of Exxon.",
      "The charm offensive flopped. Within weeks of taking office, Trump, urged by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, made restoring Venezuela's democracy his driving focus in response to Maduro's crackdown on opponents. But the outreach did bear fruit for Rodr\u00edguez, making her a prominent face in U.S. business and political circles and paving the way for her own rise.",
      "\u201cShe's an ideologue, but a practical one,\u201d said Lee McClenny, a retired foreign service officer who was the top U.S. diplomat in Caracas during the period of Rodr\u00edguez's outreach. \"She knew that Venezuela needed to find a way to resuscitate a moribund oil economy and seemed willing to work with the Trump administration to do that.\"",
      "Nearly a decade later, as Venezuela\u2019s interim president, Rodr\u00edguez's message \u2014 that Venezuela is open for business \u2014 seems to have persuaded Trump. In the days since Maduro's stunning capture Saturday, he's alternately praised Rodr\u00edguez as a \u201cgracious\u201d American partner while threatening a similar fate as her former boss if she doesn't keep the ruling party in check and provide the U.S. with \u201ctotal access\u201d to the country's vast oil reserves. One thing neither has mentioned is elections, something the constitution mandates must take place within 30 days of the presidency being permanently vacated.",
      "This account of Rodr\u00edguez's political rise is drawn from interviews with 10 former U.S. and Venezuelan officials as well as businessmen from both countries who've had extensive dealings with Rodr\u00edguez and in some cases have known her since childhood. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from someone who they almost universally described as bookishly smart, sometimes charming but above all a cutthroat operator who doesn't tolerate dissent. Rodr\u00edguez didn't respond to AP requests for an interview.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez entered the leftist movement started by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez late \u2014 and on the coattails of her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who as head of the National Assembly swore her in as interim president Monday.",
      "Tragedy during their childhood fed a hardened leftist outlook that would stick with the siblings throughout their lives. In 1976 \u2014 when, amid the Cold War, U.S. oil companies, American political spin doctors and Pentagon advisers exerted great influence in Venezuela \u2014 a little-known urban guerrilla group kidnapped a Midwestern businessman. Rodriguez's father, a socialist leader, was picked up for questioning and died in custody.",
      "McClenny remembers Rodr\u00edguez bringing up the murder in their meetings and bitterly blaming the U.S. for being left fatherless at the age of 7. The crime would radicalize another leftist of the era: Maduro.",
      "Years later, while Jorge Rodr\u00edguez was a top electoral official under Ch\u00e1vez, he secured for his sister a position in the president's office.",
      "But she advanced slowly at first and clashed with colleagues who viewed her as a haughty know-it-all.",
      "In 2006, on a whirlwind international tour, Ch\u00e1vez booted her from the presidential plane and ordered her to fly home from Moscow on her own, according to two former officials who were on the trip. Ch\u00e1vez was upset because the delegation\u2019s schedule of meetings had fallen apart and that triggered a feud with Rodriguez, who was responsible for the agenda.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to watch how Ch\u00e1vez talked about her,\u201d said one of the former officials. \u201cHe would never say a bad thing about women but the whole flight home he kept saying she was conceited, arrogant, incompetent.\u201d",
      "Days later, she was fired and never occupied another high-profile role with Ch\u00e1vez.",

      "Years later, in 2013, Maduro revived Rodr\u00edguez's career after Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer and he took over.",
      "A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodr\u00edguez speaks English and spent large amounts of time in the United States. That gave her an edge in the internal power struggles among Chavismo \u2014 the movement started by Ch\u00e1vez, whose many factions include democratic socialists, military hardliners who Ch\u00e1vez led in a 1992 coup attempt and corrupt actors, some with ties to drug trafficking.",
      "Her more worldly outlook, and refined tastes, also made Rodr\u00edguez a favorite of the so-called \u201cboligarchs\u201d \u2014 a new elite that made fortunes during Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian revolution. One of those insiders, media tycoon Raul Gorr\u00edn, worked hand-in-glove with Rodr\u00edguez's back-channel efforts to mend relations with the first Trump administration and helped organize a secret visit by Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican, to Caracas in April 2018 for a meeting with Maduro. A few months later, U.S. federal prosecutors unsealed the first of two money laundering indictments against Gorrin.",
      "After Maduro promoted Rodr\u00edguez to vice president in 2018, she gained control over large swaths of Venezuela's oil economy. To help manage the petro-state, she brought in foreign advisers with experience in global markets. Among them were two former finance ministers in Ecuador who helped run a dollarized, export-driven economy under fellow leftist Rafael Correa. Another key associate is French lawyer David Syed, who for years has been trying to renegotiate Venezuela\u2019s foreign debt in the face of crippling U.S. sanctions that make it impossible for Wall Street investors to get repaid.",
      "\u201cShe sacrificed her personal life for her political career,\u201d said one former friend.",
      "As she amassed more power, she crushed internal rivals. Among them: once powerful Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami, who was jailed in 2024 as part of an anti-corruption crackdown spearheaded by Rodr\u00edguez.",
      "In her de-facto role as Venezuela's chief operating officer, Rodr\u00edguez proved a more flexible, trustworthy partner than Maduro. Some have likened her to a sort of Venezuelan Deng Xiaoping \u2014 the architect of modern China.",
      "Hans Humes, chief executive of Greylock Capital Management, said that experience will serve her well as she tries to jump-start the economy, unite Chavismo and shield Venezuela from stricter terms dictated by Trump. Imposing an opposition-led government right now, he said, could trigger bloodshed of the sort that ripped apart Iraq after U.S. forces toppled Saddam Hussein and formed a provisional government including many leaders who had been exiled for years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how expats who have been outside of the country for too long think things should be the way it was before they left,\u201d said Humes, who has met with Maduro as well as Rodr\u00edguez on several occasions. \u201cYou need people who know how to work with how things are not how they were.\u201d",
      "Where Rodr\u00edguez's more pragmatic leadership style leaves Venezuela's democracy is uncertain.",
      "Trump, in remarks after Maduro's capture, said Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado lacks the \u201crespect\u201d to govern Venezuela despite her handpicked candidate winning what the U.S. and other governments consider a landslide victory in 2024 presidential elections stolen by Maduro.",
      "Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela during the first Trump administration, said it is impossible for the president to fulfill his goal of banishing criminal gangs, drug traffickers and Middle Eastern terrorists from the Western Hemisphere with the various factions of Chavismo sharing power.",
      "\u201cNothing that Trump has said suggests his administration is contemplating a quick transition away from Delcy. No one is talking about elections,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cIf they think Delcy is running things, they are completely wrong.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A massive 243-kilogram (535-pound) bluefin tuna sold for a record 510 million yen ($3.2 million) at the first auction of 2026 at Tokyo's Toyosu fish market.",
      "The top bidder for the prized tuna at the predawn auction on Monday was Kiyomura Corp., whose owner Kiyoshi Kimura runs the popular Sushi Zanmai chain. Kimura, who has won the annual action many times in the past, broke the previous record of 334 million yen ($2.1 million) he set in 2019.",
      "Kimura later told reporters he was hoping to pay a bit less for it, but \u201cthe price shot up before you knew it.\u201d",
      "The auction started when the bell rang, and the floor was filled with torpedo-shaped fish with their tails cut off so bidders could examine meat details such as color, texture and fattiness while walking around the rows of tuna.",
      "The pricey fish was caught off the coast of Oma in northern Japan, a region widely regarded for producing some of the country\u2019s finest tuna, and costs 2.1 million yen ($13,360) per kilogram ($6,060 per pound).",

      "This single fine is close to the normal total of $8 million to $10 million in all fines that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration hands out each year. But Third Coast has a stake in some 1,900 miles of pipelines, and in September, the Houston-based company announced that it had secured a nearly $1 billion loan.",
      "Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said this spill \u201cresulted from a company-wide systemic failure, indicating the operator\u2019s fundamental inability to implement pipeline safety regulations,\u201d so the record fine is appropriate and welcome.",

Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines.\u201d",
      "The NTSB said the leak off the coast of Louisiana was the result of underwater landslides, caused by hazards such as hurricanes, that Third Coast, the pipeline owner, failed to address despite the threats being well known in the industry.",

We will address these concerns with the agency moving forward,\" the company spokesperson said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

    "story": [
      "Once known for its rice fields and folk songs, Bac Ninh has become one of Vietnam\u2019s busiest factory zones",
      "BAC NINH, Vietnam -- The transformation of Vietnam's Bac Ninh is evident in the signs above its shops and the spicy Chinese and Korean dishes on its tables.",
      "Once known for its rice fields and the love duets of its centuries-old Quan Ho folk songs, the city just north of Hanoi has become one of Vietnam's busiest factory zones, reflecting a surge of investment, hastened by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes, that are reshaping the region.",
      "The economy has profited from friction between Washington and Beijing as factories shifted out of China, joining earlier waves of foreign investment by the Japanese and South Koreans that have made Vietnam a global manufacturing hub. But rising labor costs, worker shortages and inadequate infrastructure are exposing the limits to its rapid rise.",
      "With rivals like Indonesia and the Philippines competing hard for new projects, Vietnam is trying to climb into higher-value manufacturing and expand export markets to maintain that momentum. That effort is evident in Bac Ninh.",
      "Traditionally a center for artisans, Bac Ninh\u2019s first boom began around 2008 when Samsung built its first phone factory there, turning Vietnam into its largest offshore manufacturing base.",
      "Now, Chinese companies are pouring in as they diversify their factory locations to skirt U.S. tariffs and other trade restrictions. After Hanoi and Beijing normalized ties in the 1990s, inflows of Chinese investment began to pick up as Chinese firms in places like Bac Ninh tapped Vietnam\u2019s electronics supply chain, labor force and supportive local governments, often aided by Chinese-speaking intermediaries who smooth paperwork and logistics.",
      "But Vietnam is too small to replace China, whose economy is 40 times larger, as the world's factory floor. To try to keep up, its leaders are building new infrastructure, including a highway to the Chinese border that has cut travel time by more than an hour. A railway will connect Hanoi to Haiphong \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s largest seaport \u2014 and then the border town of Lao Cai.",
      "On Dec. 19, Bac Ninh broke ground on the expansion of an industrial zone for high-tech manufacturing, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and clean energy. It's part of a synchronized nationwide push in which Vietnam launched 234 major projects worth more than $129 billion just weeks before a pivotal National Party Congress in January, when leaders will decide the country\u2019s political leadership and economic direction.",
      "In Bac Ninh's downtown, a convenience store bears the name Tmall, after Alibaba\u2019s flagship online marketplace. Signs in Chinese advertise services for investors. Chinese\u2013Vietnamese language schools have opened to help locals and Chinese to learn each others' languages.",
      "But as Chinese companies compete for the best labor and other resources, costs are rising for the \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategy of moving factories out of China to other locations, for example, Apple's shift into India.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming difficult to recruit workers,\u201d said Peng, who works at a telecoms equipment company that moved from China\u2019s southern technology hub of Shenzhen. He gave only one name because he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Labor costs have jumped 10%\u201315% since 2024, he said, \"And we expect them to keep rising.\u201d",
      "Vietnam still need technology, equipment and expertise from China, which had created \"the best manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jacob Rothman, co-founder and CEO of China-based Velong Enterprises, which makes grill tools and kitchen gadgets and has shifted some production to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Supply chains and manufacturers in China have benefited from decades of government support, large-scale investment and its huge population, Rothman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate that overnight.\u201d",
      "Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at U.S.-based SEKO Logistics, said while factories making footwear, furniture and technology are still relocating to Vietnam, it lags China in infrastructure and logistics capabilities.",
      "Some of those limits are surfacing in boomtowns like Bac Ninh, where firms are trying to lure workers with higher wages and bonuses, a box of instant noodles on their first day and bus fares if they commute from another city, according to state media.",

      "Few countries have benefitted more from Trump's trade war than Vietnam, whose biggest export market is still the U.S. In 2024, Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion surplus with the U.S., the third largest behind China and Mexico. That irked Trump, who threatened a 46% import tax on Vietnamese goods before settling on 20%.",
      "The two countries are still working toward a deal to keep most tariffs at 20%. Vietnam has offered broad preferential access for U.S. products, the White House said in October. So far, it has largely absorbed the tariffs, running a trade surplus of $121.6 billion in January-November 2025.",
      "The agreement in October by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to a year-long trade truce and lower average tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to about 47% helped ease some concerns. But persisting uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions means companies aren\u2019t just trying to shift factories out of China but to spread them across several countries, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.",
      "Even with lower U.S. tariffs on China, the calculus still favors moving to Southeast Asia where manufacturing inefficiencies add only about 10% in cost. But while large corporations can shift production easily, smaller firms may struggle to fit a new factory with expensive equipment.",
      "\u201c(The) race to move outside of China is still happening, and it's accelerating,\u201d Rothman said.",
      "Vietnam is still attracting ample foreign investment. Cumulative foreign investment topped $28.5 billion as of September, up 15% from last year. But scrutiny of Vietnam's role as a hub for tariff-dodging transshipments has some manufacturers hedging their bets.",
      "One of SEKO Logistics' customers has shifted some of its furniture making to India, not wanting to \u201cput all their eggs in Vietnam,\u201d Bourke said.",
      "Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which missed the early gains Vietnam captured, are promoting themselves as alternative manufacturing bases. In the Philippines, a new law allows foreign investors to lease private land for up to 99 years to attract long-term commercial and industrial investment.",
      "Vietnam has a goal of becoming rich by 2045. It aims to become Asia's next \u201ctiger economy,\u201d following export powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan by shifting from low-cost assembly work to manufacture higher-value products like electronics and clean energy equipment.",
      "It's offering incentives like tax breaks on imported machinery and discounted rents to help factory suppliers upgrade and modernize. About a third still use non-automated equipment and only about 10% use robots on their production lines.",
      "The country also is trying to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market by expanding exports to the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India. Overseas trade offices have been asked to share market intelligence and promote products made in Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam knows that rising costs and tougher competition will test how far it \u2014 and places like Bac Ninh \u2014 can climb. Announcing hundreds of projects in December, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh framed the stakes: Vietnam must \u201creach far into the ocean, delve deep underground and soar high into space.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe's crisis mirrors a wider African pattern. Road accidents here kill about 300,000 people annually, about a quarter of the global toll. The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",
      "Road traffic deaths in Africa are also rising quicker than in any other region, with fatalities jumping 17% between 2010 and 2021, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s latest Africa road safety report released in mid-2024.",
      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",
      "\u201cDrivers are not licensed to be killers, they are licensed to practice road safety and safeguard lives on the road but sadly that is not the case,\u201d said police spokesperson Paul Nyathi.",
      "For instructors like Muvhevhi, survival has become the lesson.",

      "Venezuela\u2019s oil industry is in disrepair after years of neglect and international sanctions. Some oil industry analysts believe that Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day and return the nation to historic production levels relatively quickly, others see a much longer road ahead.",
      "\u201cWhile the Trump administration has suggested large U.S. oil companies will go into Venezuela and spend billions to fix infrastructure, we believe political and other risks along with current relatively low oil prices could prevent this from happening anytime soon,\u201d wrote Neal Dingmann of William Blair.

I\u2019ve been a part of a bunch of different conferences, and it\u2019s hard to argue that anybody is doing it better right now than the Big Ten. There\u2019s some quality from top to bottom.\u201d",
      "Added Cignetti: \u201cOregon is a great football team. But the Big Ten is a great conference, a lot of good teams top to bottom. And that\u2019s a great thing about the playoffs. You give 12 teams a chance to win it all, and at the end of the day there\u2019s one standing.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is under fire for generating sexualized images of women and children without consent",
      "LONDON -- Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is facing a backlash from governments around the world after a recent surge in sexualized images of women and children generated without consent by the artificial intelligence-powered tool.",
      "On Tuesday, Britain's top technology official demanded that Musk's social media platform X take urgent action while a Polish lawmaker cited it as a reason to enact digital safety laws.",
      "The European Union's executive arm has denounced Grok while officials and regulators in France, India, Malaysia and Brazil have condemned the platform and called for investigations.",
      "Rising alarm from disparate nations points to the nightmarish potential of nudification apps that use artificial intelligence to generate sexually explicit deepfake images.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look:",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. As of Tuesday, Grok users could still generate images of women using requests such as, \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",

      "\u201cWe cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls.\"",

      "\u201cWe are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "The watchdog said it contacted both X and xAI to understand what steps it has taken to comply with British regulations.",
      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",
      "A Polish lawmaker used Grok on Tuesday as a reason for national digital safety legislation that would beef up protections for minors and make it easier for authorities to remove content.",

      "The ministry accused Grok of \u201cgross misuse\u201d of AI and serious failures of its safeguards and enforcement by allowing the generation and sharing of \u201dobscene images or videos of women in derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them.\"",
      "The ministry warned failure to comply by the 72-hour deadline would expose the company to bigger legal problems, but the deadline passed with no public update from India.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- In a vision of the near future shared at CES, a girl slides into the back seat of her parents' car and the cabin instantly comes alive. The vehicle recognizes her, knows it\u2019s her birthday and cues up her favorite song without a word spoken.",
      "\u201cThink of the car as having a soul and being an extension of your family,\u201d Sri Subramanian, Nvidia's global head of generative AI for automotive, said Tuesday.",
      "Subramanian's example, shared with a CES audience on the show's opening day in Las Vegas, illustrates the growing sophistication of AI-powered in-cabin systems and the expanding scope of personal data that smart vehicles may collect, retain and use to shape the driving experience.",
      "Across the show floor, the car emerged less as a machine and more as a companion as automakers and tech companies showcased vehicles that can adapt to drivers and passengers in real time \u2014 from tracking heart rates and emotions to alerting if a baby or young child is accidentally left in the car.",
      "Bosch debuted its new AI vehicle extension that aims to turn the cabin into a \u201cproactive companion.\u201d Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, announced Alpamayo, its new vehicle AI initiative designed to help autonomous cars think through complex driving decisions. CEO Jensen Huang called it a \u201cChatGPT moment for physical AI.\u201d",

      "Unlike smartphones or online platforms, cars have only recently become major repositories of personal data, Brookman said. As a result, the industry is still trying to establish the \u201crules of the road\u201d for what automakers and tech companies are allowed to do with driver data.",
      "That uncertainty is compounded by the uniquely personal nature of cars, Brookman said. Many people see their vehicles as an extension of themselves \u2014 or even their homes \u2014 which he said can make the presence of cameras, microphones and other monitoring tools feel especially invasive.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",
      "What's more, Trump Mobile initially hailed T1 as a device that would be \u201cproudly designed and built in the United States for customers who expect the best.\"",
      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

      "The Trump Organization didn't respond to inquiries from The Associated Press about the delays or when the device is now expected to be shipped. The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",

      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, were accused of having posted numerous comments falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron \u2019s wife was born a man and likening their 24-year age gap to pedophilia. Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.",

      "Artificial intelligence will be anchored in nearly everything, again, as the tech industry explores offerings consumers will want to buy. AI industry heavyweight Jensen Huang will be taking the stage to showcase Nvidia's latest productivity solutions, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will keynote to \u201cshare her vision for delivering future AI solutions.\u201d Expect AI to come up in other keynotes, like from Lenovo's CEO, Yuanqing Yang.",

Extended reality, basically a virtual training ground for robots and other physical AI, is also in the buzz around CES.",

And at this show, for the first time, we have a Korean company showing the first ever small-scale nuclear-powered energy creation device. We expect more and more of these people rushing to fill this gap because we need the energy, we need it clean and we need a kind of all-of-the-above solution.",

      "SPRING CITY, Pa. -- Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don\u2019t want to live next to them, or even near them.",
      "Communities across the United States are reading about \u2014 and learning from \u2014 each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.",
      "In many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don\u2019t have zoning.",

Economists forecast growth slowed but remained solid in the final three months of 2025.",

      "\u201cBoeing\u2019s lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\u201d Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummalo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court. \u201cBecause he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing\u2019s attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\u201d",
      "Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane was able to land safely.",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot (61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter) piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",

      "New guidelines for healthy eating say Americans should eat more whole foods and protein, fewer highly processed foods and less added sugar",
      "Americans should eat more whole foods and protein, fewer highly processed foods and less added sugar, according to the latest edition of federal nutrition advice released Wednesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins issued the 2025-2030 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which offer updated recommendations for a healthy diet and provide the foundation for federal nutrition programs and policies. They come as Kennedy has for months stressed overhauling the U.S. food supply as part of his Make America Healthy Again agenda.",
      "\u201cOur message is clear: Eat real food,\u201d Kennedy told reporters at a White House briefing.",
      "The guidelines emphasize consumption of fresh vegetables, whole grains and dairy products, long advised as part of a healthy eating plan. Officials released a new graphic depicting an inverted version of the long-abandoned food pyramid, with protein, dairy, healthy fats and fruits and vegetables at the top and whole grains at the bottom.",
      "But they also take a new stance on \u201chighly processed\u201d foods, and refined carbohydrates, urging consumers to avoid \u201cpackaged, prepared, ready-to-eat or other foods that are salty or sweet, such as chips, cookies and candy.\" That's a different term for ultraprocessed foods, the super-tasty, energy-dense products that make up more than half of the calories in the U.S. diet and have been linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.",
      "The new guidance backs away from revoking long-standing advice to limit saturated fats, despite signals from Kennedy and Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary that the administration would push for more consumption of animal fats to end the \u201cwar\u201d on saturated fats.",
      "Instead, the document suggests that Americans should choose whole-food sources of saturated fat \u2014 such as meat, whole-fat dairy or avocados \u2014 while continuing to limit saturated fat consumption to no more than 10% of daily calories. The guidance says \u201cother options can include butter or beef tallow,\u201d despite previous recommendations to avoid those fats.",
      "The dietary guidelines, required by law to be updated every five years, provide a template for a healthy diet. But in a country where more than half of adults have a diet-related chronic disease, few Americans actually follow the guidance, research shows.",
      "The new recommendations drew praise from some prominent nutrition and medical experts.",
      "\"There should be broad agreement that eating more whole foods and reducing highly processed carbohydrates is a major advance in how we approach diet and health,\u201d said Dr. David Kessler, a former FDA commissioner who has written books about diet and nutrition and has sent a petition to the FDA to remove key ingredients in ultraprocessed foods.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health,\u201d said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.",
      "Other experts expressed relief after worrying that the guidelines would go against decades of nutrition evidence linking saturated fat to higher LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol and heart disease.",
      "\u201cI guess whoever is writing these had to admit that the science hasn't changed,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a nutritionist and food policy expert who advised previous editions of the guidelines. \u201cThey haven't changed in any fundamental way except for the emphasis on eating whole foods.\u201d",
      "The new document is just 10 pages, upholding Kennedy's pledge to create a simple, understandable guideline. Previous editions of the dietary guidelines have grown over the years, from a 19-page pamphlet in 1980 to the 164-page document issued in 2020, which included a four-page executive summary.",
      "The guidance will have the most profound effect on the federally funded National School Lunch Program, which is required to follow the guidelines to feed nearly 30 million U.S. children on a typical school day.",
      "The Agriculture Department will have to translate the recommendations into specific requirements for school meals, a process that can take years, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association. The latest school nutrition standards were proposed in 2023 but won't be fully implemented until 2027, she noted.",
      "The new guidelines skip the advice of a 20-member panel of nutrition experts, who met for nearly two years to review the latest scientific evidence on diet and health.",
      "That panel didn\u2019t make recommendations about ultraprocessed food. Although a host of studies have showed links between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes, the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research reviewed and the certainty that those foods, and not other factors, were the cause of the problems.",

      "Not all highly processed foods are unhealthy, said Dr. David Ludwig, an endocrinologist and researcher at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "\u201cI think the focus should be on highly processed carbohydrates,\u201d he said, noting that processing of protein or fats can be benign or even helpful.",
      "The guidelines made a few other notable changes, including a call to potentially double protein consumption.",
      "The previous recommended dietary allowance called for 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight \u2014 about 54 grams daily for a 150-pound person. The new recommendation is 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. An average American man consumes about 100 grams of protein per day, or about twice the previously recommended limit.",
      "Makary said the new advice supersedes protein guidance that was based on the \u201cbare minimum\u201d required for health.",
      "Ludwig also noted that the earlier recommendation was the minimum amount needed to prevent protein deficiency and higher amounts of protein might be beneficial.",
      "\u201cI think a moderate increase in protein to help displace the processed carbohydrates makes sense,\u201d he said.",
      "Officials with the American Heart Association, however, called for more research on protein consumption and the best sources of protein for optimal health.",
      "\u201cPending that research, we encourage consumers to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk,\u201d the group said in a statement.",
      "The guidelines advise avoiding or sharply limiting added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners, saying \u201cno amount\u201d is considered part of a healthy diet.",
      "No one meal should contain more than 10 grams of added sugars, or about 2 teaspoons, the new guidelines say.",
      "Previous federal guidelines recommended limiting added sugars to less than 10% of daily calories for people older than 2, but to aim for less. That's about 12 teaspoons a day in a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Children younger than 2 should have no added sugars at all, the older guidance said.",
      "In general, most Americans consume about 17 teaspoons of added sugars per day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidelines roll back previous recommendations to limit alcohol to 1 drink or less per day for women and 2 drinks or less per day for men.",
      "Instead, the guidance advises Americans to \u201cconsume less alcohol for better health.\" They also say that alcohol should be avoided by pregnant women, people recovering from alcohol use disorder and those who are unable to control the amount they drink.",

      "\u201cAmerican dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, \u201cwill never be questioned again.\u201d",
      "In the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders\u2019 messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time.\u201d said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.",
      "In the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland \u2014 where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons \u2014 and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to \u201cget their act together\u201d fighting drug cartels.",
      "Trump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is \u201cgoing down\u201d now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia \u2014 the epicenter of global cocaine production \u2014 \"sounds good to me.\"",
      "The Republican president has also said his administration will \u201crun\u201d Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not \u201cdo what\u2019s right.\u201d He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure \u2014 the oil infrastructure \u2014 and start making money for the country,\u201d Trump said over the weekend.",
      "The Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump\u2011aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non\u2011aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. \u201cabsolutely\u201d needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.",
      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.",
      "In the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Now, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.",

But for about 200 years it was either in the hands of private owners or the town.",
      "\u201cWhen you think about the importance of not just our history but those cultural and traditional areas where we practice all the things we believe in, they should be in the hands of the tribe they belong to,\" said Michell Hicks, principal chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision that we\u2019re very thankful to the town of Franklin for understanding.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- On the first anniversary of the most destructive wildfires in the L.A. area, the scant home construction projects stand out among the still mostly flattened landscapes.",
      "Fewer than a dozen homes have been rebuilt in Los Angeles County since Jan. 7, 2025, when the Palisades and Eaton fires erupted, killing 31 people and destroying about 13,000 homes and other residential properties.",
      "For those who had insurance, it\u2019s often not enough to cover the costs of construction. Relief organizations are stepping in to help, but progress is slow.",
      "Among the exceptions is Ted Koerner, whose Altadena home was reduced to ash and two chimneys. With his insurance payout tied up, the 67-year-old liquidated about 80% of his retirement holdings, secured contractors quickly, and moved decisively through the rebuilding process.",
      "Shortly before Thanksgiving, Koerner was among the first to finish a rebuild in the aftermath of the fires, which were fueled by drought and hurricane-force winds.",
      "But most do not have options like Koerner.",
      "The streets of the coastal community of Pacific Palisades and Altadena, a community in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, remain lined with dirt lots. In the seaside city of Malibu, foundations and concrete piles rising out of the sand are all that\u2019s left of beachfront homes that once butted against crashing ocean waves.",
      "Neighborhoods are pitch black at night, with few streetlamps replaced. Even many homes that survived are not inhabited as families struggle to clear them of the fire\u2019s toxic contaminants.",
      "Koerner was driven in part by fear that his beloved golden retriever, Daisy Mae, now 13 years old, might not live long enough to move into a new home, given the many months it can take to build even under the best circumstances.",
      "He also did not have to wait for his insurance payout to start construction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we were going to get it done before all of a sudden my dog starts having labored breathing or something else happens,\u201d Koerner said.",
      "Once construction began, his home was completed in just over four months.",
      "Daisy Mae is back lying in her favorite spot in the yard under a 175-year-old Heritage Oak. Koerner said he enjoys his morning coffee while watching her and it brings tears to his eyes.",
      "\u201cWe made it,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. military operation in Venezuela can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine\u2019s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.",
      "The ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria\u2019s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year\u2019s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.",
      "But President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.",
      "In addition, Trump\u2019s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.",
      "Putin himself hasn\u2019t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law \u2014 but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.",
      "\u201cEven though Trump\u2019s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency -- he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country\u2019s national interests,\u201d Medvedev said.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.",
      "Since 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can\u2019t be allowed.",
      "Putin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO\u2019s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine\u2019s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.",
      "\u201cWe have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,\u201d Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. \u201cAre we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it\u2019s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.\u201d",
      "Long before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.",
      "Fiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.",
      "Russia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow\u2019s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, \u201chinted ... many times\u201d to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.",
      "She said Trump's administration wasn\u2019t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a \u201chint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal\u201d offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that \u201cnobody\u2019s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.\u201d",
      "Hill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in \u201crestraining\u201d Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.",

      "\u201cMy worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "Before the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela \u2014 statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis \u2014 when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.",
      "Russian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.",
      "Russia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.",
      "Military experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.",
      "The U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the \u201cmight- makes-right\u201d doctrine, backing Moscow\u2019s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.",
      "After its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has \u201cnothing to formally reproach our country for,\u201d Medvedev noted.",
      "Hill noted that Maduro\u2019s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia\u2019s action in Ukraine because \u201cwe\u2019ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over \u2014 or at least decapitated the government of another country \u2014 using fiction.\u201d",
      "An indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.",

      "Russian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.",

      "Opposition supporters have long hoped their leaders could replace Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as Venezuela's president",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s opposition supporters have long hoped for the day when Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is no longer in power \u2014 a dream that was fulfilled when the U.S. military whisked the authoritarian leader away. But while Maduro is in jail in New York on drug trafficking charges, the leaders of his repressive administration remain in charge.",
      "The nation's opposition \u2014 backed by consecutive Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S. \u2014 for years vowed to immediately replace Maduro with one of their own and restore democracy to the oil-rich country. But U.S. President Donald Trump delivered them a heavy blow by allowing Maduro\u2019s vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, to assume control.",
      "Meanwhile, most opposition leaders, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, are in exile or prison.",
      "\u201cThey were clearly unimpressed by the sort of ethereal magical realism of the opposition, about how if they just gave Maduro a push, it would just be this instant move toward democracy,\u201d David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for three decades, said of the Trump administration.",
      "The U.S. seized Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores in a military operation Saturday, removing them both from their home on a military base in Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas. Hours later, Trump said the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela and expressed skepticism that Machado could ever be its leader.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the support within, or the respect within, the country,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice woman, but she doesn\u2019t have the respect.\u201d",
      "Ironically, Machado's unending praise for the American president, including dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump and her backing of U.S. campaigns to deport Venezuelan migrants and attack alleged drug traffickers in international waters, has lost her some support at home.",
      "Machado rose to become Maduro's strongest opponent in recent years, but his government barred her from running for office to prevent her from challenging \u2014 and likely beating \u2014 him in the 2024 presidential election. She chose retired ambassador Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia to represent her on the ballot.",
      "Officials loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner mere hours after the polls closed, but Machado's well-organized campaign stunned the nation by collecting detailed tally sheets showing Gonz\u00e1lez had defeated Maduro by a 2-to-1 margin.",
      "The U.S. and other nations recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate winner.",
      "However, Venezuelans identify Machado, not Gonz\u00e1lez, as the winner, and the charismatic opposition leader has remained the voice of the campaign, pushing for international support and insisting her movement will replace Maduro.",
      "In her first televised interview since Maduro's capture, Machado effusively praised Trump and failed to acknowledge his snub of her opposition movement in the latest transition of power.",
      "\u201cI spoke with President Trump on Oct. 10, the same day the prize was announced, not since then,\u201d she told Fox News on Monday. \u201cWhat he has done as I said is historic, and it\u2019s a huge step toward a democratic transition.\u201d",

Instead, the vice president \u2014 which is not an elected position \u2014 takes over for up to 90 days, with a provision to extend to six months if approved by the National Assembly, which is controlled by the ruling party.",
      "In its ruling, Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day limit, leading to speculation that Rodr\u00edguez could try to cling to power as she seeks to unite ruling party factions and shield it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.",
      "Machado on Monday criticized Rodr\u00edguez as \u201cone the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking \u2026 certainly not an individual that can be trusted by international investors.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat the opposition did in the 2024 election was to unite with a desire to transform the situation in Venezuela through democratic means, and that is embodied by Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and, obviously, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia,\u201d he said. \u201cTo disregard that is to belittle, almost to humiliate, Venezuelans.\u201d",

      "Offshore wind developers and states are suing the Trump administration over its order to suspend work on five large-scale projects under construction off the East Coast for at least 90 days",
      "Offshore wind developers and states are suing the Trump administration over its order to suspend work for at least 90 days on five large-scale projects under construction off the East Coast.",
      "The Norwegian company Equinor and the Danish energy company Orsted are the latest to challenge the suspension order, with the limited liability companies for their projects filing civil suits late Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Connecticut and Rhode Island filed their own request at that federal court on Monday seeking a preliminary injunction.",
      "The administration announced Dec. 22 it was suspending leases for five offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.",
      "President Donald Trump has been hostile to renewable energy technologies that produce electricity cleanly, particularly offshore wind, and has instead prioritized oil, coal and natural gas that emit carbon pollution when burned.",
      "Interior Department spokesperson Matt Middleton said Wednesday that Trump has directed the agency to manage public lands and waters for multiple uses, energy development, conservation and national defense. Middleton said the pause on large-scale offshore wind construction is a \u201cdecisive step to protect America\u2019s security, prevent conflicts with military readiness and maritime operations and ensure responsible stewardship of our oceans.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America\u2019s future,\u201d Middleton said in a statement.",
      "Equinor owns the Empire Wind project and Orsted owns Sunrise Wind, major offshore wind farms in New York. Empire Wind LLC requested expedited consideration by the court, saying the project faces \u201clikely termination\u201d if construction can\u2019t resume by Jan. 16. It said the order is disrupting a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with constrained availability, resulting in delay costs and causing an existential threat to the project financing.",
      "Orsted is also asking a judge to vacate and set aside the order. The company says it has spent billions of dollars on Sunrise Wind, relying on validly issued permits from the federal government. It said in the filing that its team met weekly with the Coast Guard throughout 2025, and this week, with representatives from other agencies frequently attending, and no one raised national security concerns.",
      "The administration's order paused the leases for these two projects, as well as for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.",
      "Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and unconstitutional.",

      "Iowa was the first state to apply for an exemption from certain spending rules after Education Secretary Linda McMahon invited states to request the flexibility last year. Such waivers have been offered for years but are finding new interest as Trump officials leverage all available tools to remove the federal government from local education.",
      "McMahon formally approved Iowa's plan Wednesday at an event in the state. Indiana and Kansas have also applied to be exempted from certain parts of federal education law, and leaders of other states have expressed interest.",
      "McMahon told The Associated Press that the new flexibility will free up time and money now devoted to ensuring compliance with federal rules. With fewer strings attached, states can pool their federal dollars toward priorities of their choosing, including literacy or teacher training, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are eliminating that sort of, not bottleneck, but that additional compliance for the states, and that's just going to be incredibly helpful to the state,\u201d McMahon said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to have go through the Department of Education, and it\u2019s going to flow directly more to the states,\" McMahon said.",
      "Iowa\u2019s newly approved waiver applies primarily to education money used by the state\u2019s education agency, not the larger sums of money that flow to the state\u2019s more than 300 public school districts.",
      "Under the arrangement, federal money from four programs \u2014 aimed at teacher training, English learners, after-school programs and academic enrichment \u2014 will be pooled into a single pot with fewer limits on how it is spent. Iowa\u2019s plan will merge about $9.5 million over the course of the waiver, which runs through September 2028. How much goes toward one purpose versus another is up to state officials.",

      "Known as block grants, that funding model is a longtime dream of conservatives who say money from the federal government comes with too many strings attached.",
      "Opponents say block grants would allow states to redirect money away from the students who most need the federal aid, including low-income students and English learners, and toward Republican priorities.

The early proposal requested flexibility for programs including Title I, which sends more than $100 million to Iowa schools with large shares of low-income students.",

    "story": [
      "Countless young dancers have followed in the footsteps of Carmen de Lavallade, the Grande Dame of American dance who's among those receiving Kennedy Center honors in Washington tonight. She's been shattering barriers almost all her life, as Rita Braver now shows us:",
      "The elegant 86-year-old in pink putting young members of the Dance Theatre of Harlem through their paces (\"Lighten up!\") just happens to be one of the pioneers of American Modern Dance: Carmen de Lavallade.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it always that you have hoped that audiences would get from seeing you dance over the years?\"",
      "\"The connection,\" she replied. \"Because I don't feel that I'm there just dancing for myself, you know? I'm dancing for the audience.\"",
      "The remarkable journey of this California bricklayer's daughter is being saluted this weekend with a Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "It's a story that begins when even getting dance lessons was a challenge, as she described in her 2014 one-woman show: \"In those days, there were very few people who would take you if you were colored,\" she recalled. \"And if you did get into a dance studio, the white students would walk out.\"",
      "But her talent triumphed. While still in high school, de Lavallade won a place in a prestigious L.A. dance company. And she didn't go alone. She was joined by a high school friend who turned out to be a pretty good dancer himself: Alvin Ailey.",
      "De Lavallade introduced Ailey to the world of dance, and they were partners for years.",
      "In 1954 they were invited to perform in \"House of Flowers,\" an all-black Broadway show. But it was a cast member from Trinidad who won her heart: Geoffrey Holder. They were married within three months.",
      "Braver asked, \"What was it about him that attracted you?\"",
      "\"I must say that he allowed me to be who I am. We didn't get in each other's way.\"",
      "Holder became a Tony Award-winning director (for \"The Wiz\") who often created both dances and costumes for his wife. The mementos of their life together are stored in a cavernous Harlem warehouse. \"I lived with this all my life,\" de Lavallade mused.",
      "Since Holder's death in 2014, de Lavallade  and her son, Leo, have been cataloging every piece -- letters, photos, costumes and clothes -- and recalling the stories that go with them, some of them bittersweet.",
      "In 1961 de Lavallade, by then an international sensation, was to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "But she was not allowed to perform with the white dancer she was working with at the time.",
      "Braver asked, \"How did you feel when you were told that?\"",
      "\"You know, I wasn't surprised,\" she replied. \"It's not like today where, you know, you can get up and do all your protesting. It wasn't like that. You said, 'OK, move on.'\"",
      "And move on she did. She was one of the first black dancers at the Metropolitan Opera, where she also became a choreographer.\u00a0 And she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Drama, where she taught actors how to move.",
      "She is still performing. But she has never forgotten the lessons of history and the injustice she and other Black artists have faced",
      "And so, de Lavallade became one of the Kennedy Center Honorees who announced she would boycott the now-canceled White House reception after President Trump seemed to equate White nationalists who marched in Charlottesville with protesters who opposed them.",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "Trump, first lady pull out of Kennedy Center Honors to avoid \"political distraction\" (CBS News, 08/19/17)",
      "\"I'm not political,\" she said. \"I have my own way of being political. That's the first time I've ever felt that I ... I just can't.\"",
      "Braver said, \"Some people would say, 'Well, even so, he's our president, and it's just fitting to go.'\"",
      "To which de Lavallade responded, \"I am 86 now. I have all these years, I have done what anybody asked me to, and this is the first time in my life I've ever said no. And I think at this time, it's my privilege.\"",
      "But Carmen de Lavallade will be there at tonight's Kennedy Center gala savoring her award for a life well-danced:",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",

    "summary": "FDA-approved semaglutide drug is the first GLP-1 pill for weight loss available in the U.S., according to drugmaker Novo Nordisk.",
    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, saying the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and said action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for more details on what steps Mr. Trump plans to take to limit investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research from the U.S. Government Accountability Office shows. The GAO found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory\u00a0for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-airlines-pilot-jet-panel-blew-out-sues-boeing/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",

    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Wednesday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who is attending the Goldman Sachs Energy Conference in Miami, a Department of Energy spokesperson said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",
      "Customers eligible for automatic payments are those who signed up for Prime through what the FTC calls a \"challenged enrollment flow,\" including pages such as Amazon's shipping selection page and its single-page checkout. Consumers who used three or fewer Prime benefits within a 12-month period are also due for refunds without submitting a claim.",
      "Prime benefits include services such as free two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming and Amazon Music.",
      "If you signed up for Prime through a \"challenged enrollment flow\" between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, and you used Prime benefits between three and 10 times in a 12-month period, you may need to file a claim to get money under the settlement.",
      "Eligible customers who need to file a claim will receive an email or a mailed notice, according to the settlement website.",
      "How much money will Amazon customers receive?",
      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",
      "However, some customers may see smaller amounts if, for instance, they signed up for a trial membership that charged less than the regular Prime fee, the site notes.",
      "When will you get the Amazon Prime refund?",
      "Customers will be contacted by email or mail (postmarked by January 23) to inform them if they are eligible, according to the settlement site.",
      "Consumers will then have 180 days to submit a claim, and Amazon will review each claim within 30 days of receiving it. Payments should \"follow shortly after approval of your claims form,\" the site adds.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is counting on U.S. oil companies to revive Venezuela's creaky energy production and tap its massive reserves.",
    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving Venezuela's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "Energy industry stocks and oil prices are rising after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife in a military operation on Saturday.",
      "In Wall Street trading on Monday, shares in Chevron \u2014 the only U.S. oil company\u00a0operating in Venezuela\u00a0\u2014 jumped $7.95, or 5.1%, on the day to close at $163.85. Exxon Mobil's stock increased 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.6%",
      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",
      "\"Crucially, we already expect lower oil prices to drive a modest decline in domestic U.S. oil production into 2027, and so the broader backdrop is hardly conducive to large-scale investments in new high-cost wells in Venezuela,\" he said in a client note.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 22:55:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Businesses",
      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax.

      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",

The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Steep U.S. import duties targeting 13 Italian pasta makers will be sharply reduced, Italy's foreign ministry said on Jan. 1.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The final results of Commerce's review will be announced in March, after which the duties will go into effect.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina.

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee held a hearing on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota\u200b, with testimony from state lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota, with testimony from state lawmakers who alleged officials resisted efforts to address systemic financial impropriety.",
      "\"Minnesota social services, which are funded by you, the American taxpayer, are being ripped off,\" Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican and chairman of the committee, said as he kicked off the hearing. \"The breadth and depth of this fraud is breathtaking, and I fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The panel heard from four witnesses: GOP state Reps. Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick, along with Brendan Ballou, a former prosecutor for the Justice Department who is appearing as the Democrats' witness.",
      "Asked how fraud became so widespread in Minnesota, Hudson said that \"when people recognized that the system wasn't working and they raised those concerns, those concerns were ignored and a culture suppressing raising those concerns was fostered by the Walz administration,\" referring to Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in what federal prosecutors described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\" The issue saw a resurgence late last year, and it hasn't gone away. Republicans have cited the scandal to put pressure on Walz, who announced this week that he was ending his bid for a third term.",
      "In December, Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases. Comer has invited the Minnesota governor and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify before the committee next month, and has said the committee would subpoena them if they don't appear voluntarily.",
      "\"Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota's Democrat leadership have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in these crimes,\" the chairman said. \"We must expose this theft of taxpayer dollars and hold everybody accountable who let it happen.\"",
      "The fraud hearing",
      "The three Republican state lawmakers testified about their concerns regarding the treatment of rampant fraud in Minnesota, while outlining the work they've undertaken in the state to bring it to light.",
      "Robbins said, as chair of a fraud prevention committee in the Minnesota House, she's been \"working to uncover the massive fraud under Tim Walz, propose solutions and hold state agencies accountable.\" She alleged that Walz and his administration \"have willfully turned a blind eye to crime in the face of countless whistleblower and auditor reports.\"",
      "\"The time for accountability and justice is here,\" Robbins said.",
      "Robbins outlined that the committee has identified fraud in multiple Medicaid programs, including autism centers, sober homes, non-emergency medical transportation, integrated community supports and housing stabilization. And she said her committee held a hearing last month on \"credible allegations of fraud in two new areas,\" pointing to adult day services and assisted living.",
      "Robbins also testified that her committee has evidence that, as far back as 2012, money has been sent back to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab. The Treasury Department said last month that it would\u00a0investigate\u00a0whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia.",
      "Robbins claimed that there is \"a network of people who have been politically supporting the Democrats, who have also been contributing to them, and who have been involved in multiple schemes.\"",
      "Hudson argued that the \"recent national conversation about fraud in Minnesota has been fraught with distractions, diverting from critical concerns regarding process, policy and oversight, to sideshow concerns about personalities and partisan politics.\" He said he hoped to provide a \"clear picture of a culture which has developed over many years.\"",
      "\"The full scope of the problem is not just criminal fraud, but a culture of profiting from government programs in perpetuity,\" Hudson said. \"Not as a safety net, but as an industry.\"",
      "During questioning, Comer asked Hudson: \"Why would Gov. Walz let $9 billion in fraud occur?\"",
      "\"In my opinion, because it was politically beneficial to Democrats. Again, the Somali community is a huge constituency group, and we've had some tight races in Minnesota, and it makes a difference for them,\" Hudson said.",
      "Rarick testified about whistleblowers who she said face a \"constant fear of retaliation\" that has \"intensified under an avalanche of fraud in Minnesota.\" She alleged that the Walz administration \"seriously retaliated against whistleblowers.\"",
      "Ballou, the former DOJ prosecutor and the minority's witness, said he's fearful of \"selective interest in fraud in America,\" saying \"at the same time that these crimes are rightly being investigated by state and federal authorities, the larger infrastructure for prosecuting fraud and white-collar crime is being dismantled.\"",
      "Democrats on the committee acknowledged concerns about fraud, but underlined that the response should not punish communities unjustly, while pointing to what they said was hypocrisy from their GOP colleagues when it comes to taking fraud allegations seriously.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the panel's top Democrat, acknowledged the dangers and prevalence of fraud in his opening statement, but said that \"what we should not do is use fraud as an excuse to rip away aid from innocent people who follow the rules and need help in our society.\"",
      "Garcia cited the administration's plans to\u00a0halt billions of dollars in federal funding\u00a0for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud.",
      "\"Republicans want to cut benefits and attack states with Democratic governors,\" Garcia said. \"And when it's done \u2014 particularly in places like Minnesota \u2014 it has unleashed bigotry and hate.\"",
      "What to know about Minnesota fraud",
      "Federal law enforcement officials say a litany of social service programs in Minnesota were targeted by fraudsters, including child nutrition, autism services and housing stabilization programs, in what one prosecutor described as \"industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Some 92 people have faced federal charges so far, with 62 convicted.",
      "The scandal began with allegations that people bilked nearly $250 million from a program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children during the pandemic. Dozens of people have been convicted or pleaded guilty to collecting reimbursements for meals that weren't actually served.",
      "Prosecutors have also charged over a dozen people with submitting phony reimbursements to a now-defunct program that helped seniors and people with disabilities find housing \u2014 including two Pennsylvanians who allegedly traveled to Minnesota in what officials described as \"fraud tourism.\" And a program that funds therapy for children with autism was allegedly hit with fraud.",
      "And a conservative YouTuber alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any services. Some of the day care centers and state regulators have pushed back on those allegations.",
      "Walz has faced criticism for his handling of the fraud schemes, with watchdog agencies and Republican lawmakers arguing the state government missed warning signs and moved too slowly to shut down fraudulent payments.",
      "The governor has long defended his handling of the crisis, arguing he has moved quickly to halt fraud and refer people for criminal prosecution.",
      "Walz cited the fraud earlier this week in his decision to\u00a0end his gubernatorial bid, acknowledging that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity.\" He added that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "President Trump has focused on the fact that most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing backlash from local officials like Walz, who called the president's comments \"vile, racist lies and slander.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "Maduro has rejected U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and accuses the U.S. of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the U.S. has a three-phase plan for Venezuela, with an initial emphasis on stabilizing the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the Trump administration has \"tremendous leverage\" over Venezuela because of the U.S. \"quarantine\" of sanctioned oil, and said the U.S. will control how money from sales of Venezuelan oil is disbursed.",
      "Rubio told reporters after briefing senators on the administration's involvement in Venezuela that the U.S. has a \"three-fold process\" that involves stabilization of the country, recovery and transition following the ouster of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We don't want it descending into chaos,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration's \"quarantine\" of sanctioned Venezuelan oil gives the U.S. the \"strongest leverage possible.\" He said the Trump administration is going to first be taking between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold \"at market rates.\" Crude oil prices have hovered around $60 a barrel in recent days.",
      "\"That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime, so we have a lot of leverage to move on the stabilization front,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the barrels will arrive in the U.S. \"very soon.\"",
      "\"The United States government has already begun marketing Venezuelan crude oil in the global marketplace for the benefit of the United States, engaged the world's leading commodity marketers, key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude product sales,\" she said.",
      "Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company, confirmed that it is in negotiations with the U.S. for the sale of oil \"within the framework of the existing trade relations between the two countries.\"",
      "\"This process is being carried out under similar schemes to those in place with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency, and benefit for both parties,\" the firm said in a statement. \"PDVSA reaffirms its commitment to continue building alliances that promote national development for the benefit of the Venezuelan people and that contribute to global energy stability.\"",
      "The second phase of the administration's plan, recovery, involves ensuring American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market \"in a way that's fair,\" as well as national reconciliation and amnesty for opposition forces, Rubio said. The third phase will then be transition, though the secretary of state did not provide details as to what they may entail.",
      "\"We feel like we're moving forward here in a very positive way,\" Rubio said.",
      "He said U.S. sanctions on Venezuela oil provide \"tremendous leverage,\" as the South American country's interim leaders \"cannot move any oil\" unless allowed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do,\" he said. \"Obviously this will be a process of transition. In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country.\"",
      "Senior administration officials, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been dispatched to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers about its plans for Venezuela after Maduro was deposed in an overnight operation\u00a0early Saturday.",
      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were brought to the U.S. to face drug-trafficking and weapons offenses. They pleaded not guilty Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said in announcing Maduro's ouster that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, but did not provide details as to the extent of a U.S. commitment. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president under Maduro, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deal for 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil Tuesday night and said it would be controlled \"by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\"",
      "He said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would organize the process of transferring the oil from Venezuela to the U.S. Wright said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuelan oil sales \"indefinitely.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and the second in the Caribbean Sea \u2014 that are linked to Venezuela. With the latest seizures, the U.S. has now detained four tankers tied to the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump has said U.S. energy companies would play a central role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry,\u00a0experts told CBS News it would take years for foreign oil companies to build out operations.",

Shirley alleged in the video that nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any child care services.",
      "The video has been praised by Bondi, as well as Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk.",
      "The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families has since cast doubt on the accuracy of the video, saying that a review by the state's Office of Inspector General found that nine of the centers were \"operating as expected.\"",
      "A separate CBS analysis, meanwhile, found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "One of the Minneapolis day care centers featured in Shirley's video is now closed, according to state records. Quality Learning Center closed Tuesday, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services' licensing records. CBS station WCCO is investigating the reason for the closure, which is not yet publicly known. The center's last licensing review in June found operational violations but noted no evidence of fraud.",
      "Though most of the centers have active licenses, the daycare fraud allegations have taken a toll on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who announced this week he is dropping out of the 2026 gubernatorial race amid rising tensions over his handling of the matter.",
      "The allegations surrounding the daycare facilities are among several fraud cases to hit the state. Federal prosecutors have separately alleged Minnesota is also facing a $9 billion COVID-era fraud scandal \u2014 a figure that state officials have disputed.",
      "The COVID fraud scheme has centered on a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future, and has led to charges against more than 75 defendants.",
      "The group, which works with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools, was accused of sending fake meal-count sheets and invoices.",
      "In response to the fraud allegations, the Trump administration has begun to halt some federal funding to Minnesota. In late December, the Department of Health and Human Services said it has frozen federal child care funding for the state.",
      "An HHS official\u00a0also said it was freezing billions in social services funding for five states led by Democrats, including Minnesota. The administration is withholding $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants.",

    "summary": "The new dietary recommendations are a part of President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top administration officials on Wednesday announced new dietary guidelines for Americans, recommending against highly processed foods and emphasizing protein and healthy fats.",
      "Kennedy called it \"the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history,\" saying that following the recommendations will boost Americans' overall health and decrease U.S. spending on health care. The new dietary recommendations are a part of the president's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",
      "\"Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy, made possible by President Trump's leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,\" Kennedy said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the updates will \"ensure that Americans have the most accurate, data-driven information supported by science and hard facts, not special interests or partisan ideology.\"",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the U.S. is \"in the middle of the worst chronic health crisis in our nation's history.\" She said over 40% of children in the U.S. are experiencing at least one chronic health condition, and she said the vast majority of health care spending goes toward treating people with chronic diseases.",
      "Rollins said the new guidelines will encourage households and schools to prioritize \"more protein, more dairy, more healthy fats, more whole grains, more fruits and vegetables.\"",
      "\"For decades, decades, under both Republicans and Democrats, federal incentives have promoted low-quality, highly processed foods and pharmaceutical interventions instead of prevention,\" Rollins said. \"... Thankfully, the solution is simple and should be noncontroversial \u2014 eat real food.\"",
      "It's not yet clear how the guidelines will be implemented in schools, prisons and other government facilities.",
      "\"There is a lot of work to do,\" Rollins said. \"Nothing changes overnight.\"",
      "Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said the new dietary guidelines, if followed, could allow Americans to work a year longer and \"jazz up\" the American economy because of that.",
      "Instead of providing specific limit guidelines on alcohol, as past guidelines did, the new language says to decrease alcohol consumption.",
      "\"Alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together,\" Oz said Wednesday. \"In the best case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol. But it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize and there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.\"",
      "\"The implication is, don't have it for breakfast,\" Oz added.",
      "The dietary guidelines come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is overseen by Kennedy's health department, has scaled back recommended childhood immunizations. That decision was met with concern by those in the medical community who fear fewer vaccinations will lead to more illnesses and deaths.",
      "\"We want to maximize the uptake of the vaccines by making sure that Americans know that we are making recommendations that are science-based, that are common sense, that are grounded in science,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week that it will no longer recommend vaccinating children against against hepatitis A,\u00a0hepatitis B\u00a0and rotavirus, despite the CDC's own publications saying the vaccinations have prevented more than 90,000 deaths and almost 2 million hospitalizations across the last three decades.",

      "\"It won't happen under my watch,\" Paul said on \"CBS Mornings\" about military action in Greenland. \"I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\"",
      "The Kentucky senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long opposed offensive U.S. military action overseas. He voted to advance a war powers resolution, which would have limited the president's authority to continue a military campaign in Venezuela, but Senate Republicans blocked the measure. The Trump administration did not seek congressional approval before launching last week's strikes. The Senate is expected to bring up a war powers resolution again this week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of President Trump's interest in Greenland that he and his team are \"discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\"",
      "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. A lawmaker and a source familiar with the discussions said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of Congress at briefing Tuesday that Mr. Trump would buy Greenland and not take it by force.",
      "Paul did not raise an objection to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "\"Half of the United States came to us through the Louisiana Purchase,\" Paul noted. \"Alaska came to us through a purchase. But you didn't get to those purchases like any deal or diplomacy by insulting your opponent. You get there by actually trying to please and get your opponent to agree to this, because it would have to be done voluntarily.\"",
      "Paul said that this type of action in Greenland would have to be initiated by a vote from its more than 50,000 citizens declaring their independence from Denmark, adding, \"I think the people of Greenland are inclined to do\" this.",
      "That would also have to be followed by \"some sort of offer of something that makes it better to be a part of the United States,\" he continued.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the strikes in Venezuela, Paul suggested it marked the beginning of the \"Don-roe doctrine,\" leading to questions about expansion extending to other territories, including Greenland and Canada.",

      "Mr. Trump has referred to Canada the \"51st state\" and imposed punishing tariffs against the U.S.' northern neighbor, raising tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Paul said he's been consistent about his opposition to military action overseas, and he stressed the importance of maintaining Congress' constitutional authority to declare war.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to identify herself as a U.S. attorney despite a different judge finding her appointment as the top federal prosecutor in eastern Virginia was invalid.",
      "U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits in Richmond, gave Halligan seven days to provide the basis for her use of the title and ordered her to explain why her identification as U.S. attorney \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\"",
      "Novak also instructed Halligan to lay out the reasons why the court \"should not strike Ms. Halligan's identification as United States attorney\" from an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in early December. Halligan's name is listed on the indictment and her title as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in November that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies. Because of the finding, Currie ordered criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed. The Justice Department appealed the decision, but it has not asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to freeze Currie's ruling while it considers the appeal.",
      "As a result, Novak said the decision \"remains binding precedent in this district and is not subject to being ignored.\"",
      "Shortly after Currie's ruling, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia received orders to keep Halligan's title of U.S. attorney on all pleadings, claiming that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had approved it, according to an email reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In the email, prosecutors were told to list her as both United States Attorney and Special United States Attorney, with the word \"Attorney\" misspelled in the first title. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order in October that purported to retroactively appoint Halligan as special attorney, effective Sept. 22.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team in a civil case arising from former special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in January 2021. She then joined Mr. Trump at the White House after he won a second term in November 2024.",
      "Halligan was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September after Erik Siebert, who was the top prosecutor for the region, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and sought to have their respective indictments dismissed on numerous grounds, including the validity of Halligan's appointment.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. Their tenure can then be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "But Currie found that Halligan's appointment was not consistent with that framework because the 120-day clock started running when Siebert was appointed in January. When that timeframe expired, Attorney General Pam Bondi's authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney did too, the judge found.",
      "Currie found that Halligan had been serving unlawfully since Sept. 22 and concluded that \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment\" had to be set aside.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power in a network exclusive interview with CBS News \u2014 and made the case for why her political coalition should lead the country.",
    "story": [
      "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado hailed President Trump for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power and argued her coalition has a mandate to lead the country moving forward \u2014 even as Mr. Trump leaves doubts about whether Machado could take power herself.",
      "Machado spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in a network exclusive on Tuesday, just three days after the U.S. military executed a daring mission to capture Maduro, ending the authoritarian president's nearly 13-year reign over Venezuela.",
      "Machado has aligned herself with Mr. Trump in recent months, backing his administration's months-long pressure campaign against Maduro's regime and dedicating her Nobel Peace Prize to him. When Mr. Trump ordered last weekend's surprise operation to pluck Maduro from Caracas and fly him to New York on drug charges, Machado vocally celebrated the move.",
      "Since then, Machado has called for her ally Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 whom the U.S. recognizes as the winner of the country's 2024 election \u2014 to take over Venezuela as soon as possible, replacing the Maduro operatives who are still running the country.",
      "But Mr. Trump has declined to back Machado's movement. He said Saturday that it would be \"very tough\" for her to run Venezuela and doubted she has enough support within the country, saying: \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.\"",
      "Pressed on why she believes Mr. Trump said that about her, Machado suggested there could be lingering worries about Venezuela's stability. She told CBS News that Venezuela \"has been taken over by a criminal narcoterrorist system\" backed by guerrilla groups and U.S. adversaries like Iran and Cuba, and \"there is fear that these groups will resist a peaceful transition.\"",
      "However, Machado said she believes \"a wide majority of the military and police in Venezuela also support an orderly transition to democracy.\"",
      "She continued: \"I believe we have a united country.\"",
      "Asked if she believes she is the right person to lead Venezuela in the first chapter of its post-Maduro future, Machado told CBS News \"the people of Venezuela have already chosen,\" and her coalition is \"ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated.\"",
      "She pointed to the country's heavily contested 2024 election, when Gonz\u00e1lez faced off against Maduro because the government banned Machado \u2014 who won the opposition's primary \u2014 from running herself. Maduro's government declared him the winner, but those results were rejected by much of the international community and are widely seen as tainted by pervasive fraud.",
      "Machado \u2014 who told CBS News she has not spoken with Mr. Trump this year \u2014 said Venezuelans are \"very grateful\" to Mr. Trump. She called Maduro's arrest a \"major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela.\"",
      "She acknowledged that the country is not there yet. She alleged that Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, played a key role in Maduro's corruption, was \"one of the main architects\" of Venezuela's security state and served as the \"main link\" between the South American country and Russia and Iran.",
      "\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.",
      "Asked if she has a message for Mr. Trump, she said: \"Trust the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "\"We've come a long way,\" she said, pointing to what she called a \"landslide\" win in 2024 despite widespread allegations of fraud. \"So imagine if there had been free and fair elections.\"",
      "She predicted that Venezuela \"will be not only a security ally to the United States, but a country of prosperity,\" allowing millions of Venezuelans who have left the country due to economic deprivation and political threats to return home. And she said she supports U.S. oil companies returning to Venezuela, backing a recent push by Mr. Trump.",
      "She also predicted that the remnants of Maduro's government and any violent groups in the country will be \"neutralized.\"",
      "\"I dare to say there is no other society in this hemisphere as cohesive and united as Venezuelan society,\" she said. \"More than 90% of our population wants the same. We want to live with respect, with dignity, with justice and opportunities.\"",

      "A former legislator, Machado won a primary race to run against Maduro in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election. The government then banned her from running, but retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez stepped in as a replacement. The U.S. and other governments recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner after the Maduro government was accused of rigging the vote tallies.",

    "summary": "After the U.S. deposed Maduro, Trump and top officials did not rule out efforts at overthrow or annexation in other countries. Here's what they've said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:21:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Two U.S. intelligence officials said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing Soviet-era defense systems and armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces planned to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans told CBS News Monday.",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News Tuesday that Russia had sent a submarine and other Russian naval vessels to escort the tanker Marinera, which sails under a Russian flag. The Wall Street Journal was first to\u00a0report\u00a0on the escort.",
      "It is unclear where the U.S. plans stood now that Russian naval assets had been dispatched. It is not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning had said Monday the interdiction mission could come as early as this week, but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The webpage, featured under the official whitehouse.gov domain, says Democrats framed \"the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new webpage under the official whitehouse.gov domain, rolled out five years after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, rewrites the history of the attack on the Capitol that took place as Congress was affirming Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The website expresses views long promoted by President Trump that the Jan. 6 attack was a \"peaceful march,\" blames Capitol Police for \"escalating tensions,\" and repeats Mr. Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "\"The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as 'insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump\u2014despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government,\" the new webpage says.",
      "White House spokesperson Steven Cheung posted a link to it on social media and wrote \"Want to know the TRUTH? Get all the facts here.\" The White House's official X account also posted a link to it, writing \"Now see the REAL Jan. 6 story.\"",
      "Thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol that day and breached the building after smashing through windows on the first floor. They vandalized the Capitol, forced the evacuation of lawmakers and their staff and assaulted police officers on site with flagpoles, bear spray and other objects. More than 150 officers were injured. Five police officers who served at the Capitol died in the days and weeks afterward.",
      "One woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by Capitol Police as a crowd tried to enter the House chamber, while three others died amid the chaos.",
      "On the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term, he pardoned more than 1,500 people who were convicted or charged in the attack, among them, individuals convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "The new webpage puts forth a different view of the president's clemency, declaring Mr. Trump pardoned \"January 6 defendants who were unfairly targeted, overcharged, and used as political examples. They were not protected by the leaders who failed them. They were punished to cover incompetence.\"",
      "It's a version of history that Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, disputed on the Senate floor Tuesday, as he stood by a Jan. 6 plaque commemorating the officers who protected the Capitol and Congress on Jan. 6. \"We let bad people go,\" he said, noting that some of the pardoned rioters have been arrested again.",
      "The White House webpage claims that when the crowd arrived at the Capitol that day, \"Capitol Police aggressively fire tear gas, flash bangs, and rubber munitions into crowds of peaceful protesters, injuring many and deliberately escalating tensions.\" It goes on to claim, \"Video evidence shows officers inexplicably removing barricades, opening Capitol doors, and even waving attendees inside the building\u2014actions that facilitated entry\u2014while simultaneously deploying violent force against others. These inconsistent and provocative tactics turned a peaceful demonstration into chaos.\"",
      "The site does not include accounts by some police officers in congressional testimony that conflict with the White House version. One officer described it as \"a war scene.\"",
      "The webpage also claims former Vice President Mike Pence could have rejected the electoral votes but chose \"not to exercise that power in an act of cowardice and sabotage,\" even though the vice president's role in certifying Biden's victory was ceremonial. Pence's former chief of staff, Marc Short, appeared to take issue with the White House characterization, re-posting it on X with the comment, \"And I guess yall would have been okay if Kamala had refused to certify the 2024 results?\"",
      "Some Capitol rioters chanted outside the chamber \"hang Mike Pence\" as they attempted to stop the proceedings.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mr. Trump was impeached by the House for inciting the riot, but he was acquitted by the Senate. He was later indicted by a federal grand jury for attempting to overthrow the election.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. He never stood trial on the charges, which were eventually dropped when he returned to office last year.",
      "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also targeted on Jan. 6 by rioters, who broke into her office and chanted \"Where's Nancy?\" as her staff hid. Her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, captured footage of the then-Speaker saying during the riot that she takes \"full responsibility\" for not being better prepared for security failures.",
      "The new webpage prominently puts the blame on Pelosi for \"security lapses\" that \"invited the chaos [Democrats] later exploited to seize and consolidate power. \"",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, was asked about the website's claims that the Capitol police response escalated tensions. She told reporters \"I disagree with that completely.\"",
      "\"I was there that day. I was on the floor,\" Collins said. \"I heard the rioters going past the chamber chanting 'hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence.' I saw him being rushed out, they clearly put him in danger. And I thought the Capitol Police were heroic.\"",

      "\"President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it's vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,\" Leavitt said. \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief's disposal.\"",

      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",

      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",

      "Amid an ongoing fraud scandal in Minnesota and a nationwide immigration crackdown, President Trump has recently taken aim at Somali immigrants, describing them in disparaging terms and saying they're \"ripping off our country.\" Asked about Mr. Trump's comments and whether legal Somali immigrants should be worried, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS News in an exclusive interview, \"I'm focused on policing the streets, not policing President Trump's words.\"",
      "Noem has deployed 2,000 agents to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul to conduct immigration raids and assist in the widening fraud investigation.",
      "Asked how she justified the expense to the taxpayers of sending that many agents in, Noem said, \"The American taxpayer is grateful that that resource allocation has been put here. We've never seen this kind of fraudulence and abuse of programs before in recent history.\"",
      "Over the past three years, prosecutors in the area have charged more than 90 people with fraud,\u00a078 of whom were arrested in connection with a fraud scheme involving a nonprofit called\u00a0Feeding Our Future, which was supposed to help feed vulnerable children during the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority of those charged in that scheme are Somali Americans, although the program's leader, Aimee Bock, who was\u00a0convicted earlier this year, is not.",
      "The ongoing fraud scandal prompted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to drop his reelection bid this week.",
      "Last month, a viral video from conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota were receiving public funds are not actually providing any service, prompting calls for further investigations. Nine of those child care centers were \"operating as expected\" when state investigators conducted on-site checks last week, officials said on Friday. One of the centers had been closed since 2022. A CBS News review of those centers found dozens of citations related to safety, cleanliness, equipment and staff training, among other violations, but there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "But Mr. Trump has continued to lash out at the Somali community, and has called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The president's words, and the show of force behind them, have shaken the Somali community.",
      "Youth counselor Mohamed Jama told CBS News he was recently interrogated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.",
      "\"The line has been blurred. You could be a citizen and still get detained,\" Jama, who is an American citizen, said.",
      "The vast majority of Somali Americans in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, and Noem said agents are not targeting any one community.",
      "Asked what Noem's message to Jama would be, she told CBS News, \"Every individual that we have focused on the last year, as far as the Department of Homeland Security, has been someone who has broken our laws.\"",
      "She insisted people like Jama have nothing to worry about.",
      "\"Law-abiding citizens of this country should be grateful that we are here today and that we're making their streets safer,\" Noem said.",

    "story": [
      "Former Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne tribal chief who became a prominent American politician, has died. He was 92.",
      "His daughter Shanan Campbell confirmed to CBS News that her father died Tuesday at his home on a ranch in southwestern Colorado surrounded by family members.",
      "Campbell served in Colorado's congressional delegation across three different decades. He started out as a member of the Democratic Party and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1980s. In the mid-1990s, three years after his election to the U.S. Senate, he decided to leave the Democrats and switch to the Republican Party. He served two terms as senator and then retired in the 2000s because of what he said were concerns about his health.",
      "\"I thought it was a heart attack. It wasn't,\" Campbell said at the time. \"But when I was lying on that table in the hospital looking up at all those doctors' faces, I decided then, 'Do I really need to do this six more years after I've been gone so much from home?' I have two children I didn't get to see grow up, quite frankly.\"",
      "Campbell was known for his advocacy of Native American issues. He said his ancestors were among more than 150 Native Americans, mostly women, children and elderly men, killed by U.S. soldiers while camped under a flag of truce on Nov. 29, 1864.",
      "Among his accomplishments was helping sponsor legislation upgrading the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado to a national park.",
      "His abrupt decision to switch parties in 1995 stunned Democratic leaders as well as his Colorado constituents. He was angry with Democrats at the time for killing a balanced-budget amendment in the Senate.",
      "\"It didn't change me. I didn't change my voting record. For instance, I had a sterling voting record as a Democrat on labor. I still do as a Republican. And on minorities and women's issues,\" he said.",
      "After he retired, he focused partly on the Native American jewelry that helped make him wealthy and was put on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. He also founded Ben Nighthorse Consultants which focused on federal policy, including Native American affairs and natural resources.",
      "Sen. John Hickenlooper, Colorado's junior U.S. senator, was among those who shared remembrances of Campbell after learning the news.",
      "\"He was a master jeweler with a reputation far beyond the boundaries of Colorado. I will not forget his acts of kindness. He will be sorely missed,\" Hickenlooper said on X.",
      "Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents Colorado's 1st Congressional District,  said on X: \"He was truly one of a kind, and I am thinking of his family in the wake of his loss.\"",
      "Shanan Campbell confirmed that Cambell's wife \"of almost 60 years,\" Linda Campbell, was among those who were with him when he died.",
      "Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, wrote on X: \"Colorado lost a true legend in former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. A proud Northern Cheyenne, Olympian, veteran, and trailblazing leader who championed our great state.\" She said that he and Linda \"were pioneers for Colorado and built a legacy of strength, service, and innovation that will inspire generations to come.\"",
      "Campbell never lost an election",
      "In 1982, Campbell was planning to deliver his jewelry to California, but bad weather grounded his plane. He was killing time in the southern Colorado city of Durango when he went to a county Democratic meeting and wound up giving a speech for a friend running for sheriff.",
      "Democrats were looking for someone to challenge a GOP legislative candidate and sounded out Campbell during the meeting. \"Like a fish, I was hooked,\" he said.",
      "His opponent, Don Whalen, was a popular former college president who \"looked like he was out of a Brooks Brothers catalog,\" Campbell recalled. \"I don't think anybody gave me any kind of a chance. ... I just think I expended a whole lot of energy to prove them wrong.\"",
      "Campbell hit the streets, ripping town maps out of the Yellow Pages and walking door to door to talk with people. He recalled leaving a note at a house in Cortez where no one was home when he heard a car roar into the driveway, gravel flying and brakes squealing.",
      "The driver jumped out, tire iron in hand, and screamed that Campbell couldn't have his furniture. \"Aren't you the repossession company?\" the man asked.",
      "\"And I said, 'No man, I'm just running for office.' We got to talking, and I think the guy voted for me.\"",
      "Campbell went on to win and he never lost an election thereafter, moving from the Colorado House to three terms in the U.S. House and then to the Senate.",
      "Born April 13, 1933, in Auburn, California, Campbell served in the Air Force in Korea from 1951 to 1953 and received a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University in 1957. He attended Meiji University in Tokyo from 1960 to 1964, was captain of the U.S. judo team in the 1964 Olympics and won a gold medal in the Pan American Games.",
      "Campbell once called then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt a \"forked-tongued snake\" for opposing a water project near the southern Colorado town of Ignacio, which Campbell promoted as a way to honor the water rights of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.",
      "He clashed with environmentalists on everything from mining law and grazing reforms to setting aside land for national monuments.",
      "Despite all this -- or perhaps because of it -- voters loved him. In 1998, Campbell won reelection to the Senate by routing Democrat Dottie Lamm, the wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, despite his switch to the GOP. He was the only Native American in the Senate at the time.",
      "Campbell said his values -- liberal on social issues, conservative on fiscal ones -- were shaped by his life. Children's causes were dear to him because he and his sister spent time in an orphanage when his father was in jail and his mother had tuberculosis.",
      "Organized labor won his backing because hooking up with the Teamsters and learning to drive a truck got him out of the California tomato fields. His time as a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy in California in the late 1960s and early '70s made him a law enforcement advocate.",
      "His decision to retire from politics, Campbell said, had nothing to do with allegations that Ginnie Kontnik, his former chief of staff, solicited kickbacks from another staffer and that his office lobbied for a contract for a technology company with ties to the former senator.",
      "He referred both matters to the Senate Ethics Committee. In 2007, Kontnik pleaded guilty to a federal charge of not reporting $2,000 in income.",
      "\"I guess there was some disappointment\" with those charges, Campbell said. \"But a lot of things happen in Washington that disappoint you. You just have to get over them because every day there's a new crisis to deal with.\"",
      "Update: This story has been corrected to remove a reference to a massacre occurring at Great Sand Dunes National Monument. The massacre that was referenced took place at the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site."

    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",
      "\"I know what's damaging and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security,\" he told the New York Times. \"And I'm going to act on that.\"",

    "summary": "The hydrogen cloud is a remnant of the universe's early formation, NASA said in a news release.",
    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

      "AI-generated images, old videos and altered photos proliferated on social media in the hours following former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture. Several of these images quickly went viral, fueling false information online.",
      "CBS News analyzed circulating images by comparing dubious images to verified content and using publicly available tools such as reverse image search. In some cases, CBS News ran images through AI detection tools, which can be inconsistent or inaccurate but can still help flag possibly manipulated content.",
      "Checking the source of the content, as well as the date, location, and other news sources are all ways to suss out whether an image is accurate, according to experts.",
      "AI-generated images of Maduro flood social media",
      "After President Trump announced Maduro's capture in a social media post early Saturday morning, questions brewed about the logistics of the mission, where Maduro would be flown and the future of Venezuela. Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",
      "Another unverified photo that made the rounds on social media depicts Maduro in an aircraft with U.S. soldiers. While two different AI detection tools gave inconsistent results as to its authenticity, CBS was not able to confirm its legitimacy.",
      "Trump posts photo of Maduro in U.S. custody",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump posted an image captioned \"Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima\" after the South American leader's capture. Later that evening, the White House Rapid Response account shared a video that appeared to show Maduro being escorted down a hallway by federal agents.",
      "Old images recirculate",
      "Old videos and images from past events recirculated, purporting to show reactions to Maduro's capture and strikes in Caracas. One video showing people tearing down a billboard image of Maduro dates as far back as July 2024. Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",
      "CBS News reached out to X and Meta regarding the companies' policies on AI-generated images, but has not received a response. X's rules page says it may label posts containing synthetic and manipulated media and Meta says it prohibits AI that contributes to misinformation or disinformation.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",

      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",

Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",

      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee held a hearing on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota\u200b, with testimony from state lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a series of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes in Minnesota, with testimony from state lawmakers who alleged officials resisted efforts to address systemic financial impropriety.",
      "\"Minnesota social services, which are funded by you, the American taxpayer, are being ripped off,\" Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican and chairman of the committee, said as he kicked off the hearing. \"The breadth and depth of this fraud is breathtaking, and I fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The panel heard from four witnesses: GOP state Reps. Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick, along with Brendan Ballou, a former prosecutor for the Justice Department who is appearing as the Democrats' witness.",
      "Asked how fraud became so widespread in Minnesota, Hudson said that \"when people recognized that the system wasn't working and they raised those concerns, those concerns were ignored and a culture suppressing raising those concerns was fostered by the Walz administration,\" referring to Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in what federal prosecutors described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\" The issue saw a resurgence late last year, and it hasn't gone away. Republicans have cited the scandal to put pressure on Walz, who announced this week that he was ending his bid for a third term.",
      "In December, Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases. Comer has invited the Minnesota governor and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify before the committee next month, and has said the committee would subpoena them if they don't appear voluntarily.",
      "\"Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota's Democrat leadership have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in these crimes,\" the chairman said. \"We must expose this theft of taxpayer dollars and hold everybody accountable who let it happen.\"",
      "The fraud hearing",
      "The three Republican state lawmakers testified about their concerns regarding the treatment of rampant fraud in Minnesota, while outlining the work they've undertaken in the state to bring it to light.",
      "Robbins said, as chair of a fraud prevention committee in the Minnesota House, she's been \"working to uncover the massive fraud under Tim Walz, propose solutions and hold state agencies accountable.\" She alleged that Walz and his administration \"have willfully turned a blind eye to crime in the face of countless whistleblower and auditor reports.\"",
      "\"The time for accountability and justice is here,\" Robbins said.",
      "Robbins outlined that the committee has identified fraud in multiple Medicaid programs, including autism centers, sober homes, non-emergency medical transportation, integrated community supports and housing stabilization. And she said her committee held a hearing last month on \"credible allegations of fraud in two new areas,\" pointing to adult day services and assisted living.",
      "Robbins also testified that her committee has evidence that, as far back as 2012, money has been sent back to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab. The Treasury Department said last month that it would\u00a0investigate\u00a0whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia.",
      "Robbins claimed that there is \"a network of people who have been politically supporting the Democrats, who have also been contributing to them, and who have been involved in multiple schemes.\"",
      "Hudson argued that the \"recent national conversation about fraud in Minnesota has been fraught with distractions, diverting from critical concerns regarding process, policy and oversight, to sideshow concerns about personalities and partisan politics.\" He said he hoped to provide a \"clear picture of a culture which has developed over many years.\"",
      "\"The full scope of the problem is not just criminal fraud, but a culture of profiting from government programs in perpetuity,\" Hudson said. \"Not as a safety net, but as an industry.\"",
      "During questioning, Comer asked Hudson: \"Why would Gov. Walz let $9 billion in fraud occur?\"",
      "\"In my opinion, because it was politically beneficial to Democrats. Again, the Somali community is a huge constituency group, and we've had some tight races in Minnesota, and it makes a difference for them,\" Hudson said.",
      "Rarick testified about whistleblowers who she said face a \"constant fear of retaliation\" that has \"intensified under an avalanche of fraud in Minnesota.\" She alleged that the Walz administration \"seriously retaliated against whistleblowers.\"",
      "Ballou, the former DOJ prosecutor and the minority's witness, said he's fearful of \"selective interest in fraud in America,\" saying \"at the same time that these crimes are rightly being investigated by state and federal authorities, the larger infrastructure for prosecuting fraud and white-collar crime is being dismantled.\"",
      "Democrats on the committee acknowledged concerns about fraud, but underlined that the response should not punish communities unjustly, while pointing to what they said was hypocrisy from their GOP colleagues when it comes to taking fraud allegations seriously.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the panel's top Democrat, acknowledged the dangers and prevalence of fraud in his opening statement, but said that \"what we should not do is use fraud as an excuse to rip away aid from innocent people who follow the rules and need help in our society.\"",
      "Garcia cited the administration's plans to\u00a0halt billions of dollars in federal funding\u00a0for social services programs in five states led by Democrats following allegations of fraud.",
      "\"Republicans want to cut benefits and attack states with Democratic governors,\" Garcia said. \"And when it's done \u2014 particularly in places like Minnesota \u2014 it has unleashed bigotry and hate.\"",
      "What to know about Minnesota fraud",
      "Federal law enforcement officials say a litany of social service programs in Minnesota were targeted by fraudsters, including child nutrition, autism services and housing stabilization programs, in what one prosecutor described as \"industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Some 92 people have faced federal charges so far, with 62 convicted.",
      "The scandal began with allegations that people bilked nearly $250 million from a program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children during the pandemic. Dozens of people have been convicted or pleaded guilty to collecting reimbursements for meals that weren't actually served.",
      "Prosecutors have also charged over a dozen people with submitting phony reimbursements to a now-defunct program that helped seniors and people with disabilities find housing \u2014 including two Pennsylvanians who allegedly traveled to Minnesota in what officials described as \"fraud tourism.\" And a program that funds therapy for children with autism was allegedly hit with fraud.",
      "And a conservative YouTuber alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any services. Some of the day care centers and state regulators have pushed back on those allegations.",
      "Walz has faced criticism for his handling of the fraud schemes, with watchdog agencies and Republican lawmakers arguing the state government missed warning signs and moved too slowly to shut down fraudulent payments.",
      "The governor has long defended his handling of the crisis, arguing he has moved quickly to halt fraud and refer people for criminal prosecution.",
      "Walz cited the fraud earlier this week in his decision to\u00a0end his gubernatorial bid, acknowledging that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity.\" He added that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "President Trump has focused on the fact that most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing backlash from local officials like Walz, who called the president's comments \"vile, racist lies and slander.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize the oil tankers Marinera and Sophia, officials announced.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "Maduro has rejected U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and accuses the U.S. of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:03:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the U.S. has a three-phase plan for Venezuela, with an initial emphasis on stabilizing the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the Trump administration has \"tremendous leverage\" over Venezuela because of the U.S. \"quarantine\" of sanctioned oil, and said the U.S. will control how money from sales of Venezuelan oil is disbursed.",
      "Rubio told reporters after briefing senators on the administration's involvement in Venezuela that the U.S. has a \"three-fold process\" that involves stabilization of the country, recovery and transition following the ouster of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We don't want it descending into chaos,\" he said.",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration's \"quarantine\" of sanctioned Venezuelan oil gives the U.S. the \"strongest leverage possible.\" He said the Trump administration is going to first be taking between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold \"at market rates.\" Crude oil prices have hovered around $60 a barrel in recent days.",
      "\"That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime, so we have a lot of leverage to move on the stabilization front,\" he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the barrels will arrive in the U.S. \"very soon.\"",
      "\"The United States government has already begun marketing Venezuelan crude oil in the global marketplace for the benefit of the United States, engaged the world's leading commodity marketers, key banks to execute and provide financial support for these crude oil and crude product sales,\" she said.",
      "Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company, confirmed that it is in negotiations with the U.S. for the sale of oil \"within the framework of the existing trade relations between the two countries.\"",
      "\"This process is being carried out under similar schemes to those in place with international companies, such as Chevron, and is based on a strictly commercial transaction, with criteria of legality, transparency, and benefit for both parties,\" the firm said in a statement. \"PDVSA reaffirms its commitment to continue building alliances that promote national development for the benefit of the Venezuelan people and that contribute to global energy stability.\"",
      "The second phase of the administration's plan, recovery, involves ensuring American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market \"in a way that's fair,\" as well as national reconciliation and amnesty for opposition forces, Rubio said. The third phase will then be transition, though the secretary of state did not provide details as to what they may entail.",
      "\"We feel like we're moving forward here in a very positive way,\" Rubio said.",
      "He said U.S. sanctions on Venezuela oil provide \"tremendous leverage,\" as the South American country's interim leaders \"cannot move any oil\" unless allowed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"There is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do,\" he said. \"Obviously this will be a process of transition. In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country.\"",
      "Senior administration officials, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been dispatched to Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers about its plans for Venezuela after Maduro was deposed in an overnight operation\u00a0early Saturday.",
      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were brought to the U.S. to face drug-trafficking and weapons offenses. They pleaded not guilty Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said in announcing Maduro's ouster that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, but did not provide details as to the extent of a U.S. commitment. Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president under Maduro, was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the deal for 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil Tuesday night and said it would be controlled \"by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\"",
      "He said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would organize the process of transferring the oil from Venezuela to the U.S. Wright said earlier Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuelan oil sales \"indefinitely.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and the second in the Caribbean Sea \u2014 that are linked to Venezuela. With the latest seizures, the U.S. has now detained four tankers tied to the country.",
      "While Mr. Trump has said U.S. energy companies would play a central role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry,\u00a0experts told CBS News it would take years for foreign oil companies to build out operations.",

    "story": [
      "Nick Reiner's arraignment was postponed again Wednesday in the murders of his parents, filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner, after his attorney, Alan Jackson, withdrew from the case. The arraignment hearing is now scheduled for Feb. 23.",
      "The Los Angeles County Public Defender's Office will take over for Jackson and his co-counsel, both of whom stepped down. Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene will represent Nick Reiner, who will remain in custody until the new hearing date. He is being held without bail.",
      "At a news conference after the hearing concluded, Jackson said his team's withdrawal was due to \"circumstances beyond our control, but more importantly, circumstances beyond Nick's control,\" which \"have dictated that, sadly, it's impossible for us to continue our representation.\" Jackson did not provide details and said he was \"legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"",
      "Jackson emphasized that his team remained \"deeply committed to Nick Reiner and to his best interests.\"",
      "Greene declined to answer questions from reporters who asked how Reiner intends to plead, saying they only spoke briefly in court. The public defender added that her office has not had contact with the Reiner family, and the family may not have been \"aware of what's going on.\"",
      "\"They have the utmost trust in the legal process and will not comment further on matters related to the legal proceedings,\" a spokesperson for the family said in a statement to CBS Los Angeles.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the prosecution would make sure Reiner's defense gets what they need to represent him, and he is \"fully confident a jury will find Nick Reiner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the murder of his parents.\"",
      "Reiner, 32, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances after prosecutors said the couple were stabbed to death on Dec. 14 in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighborhood. The L.A. County medical examiner\u00a0said they died from \"multiple sharp force injuries.\"",
      "If convicted as charged, Nick Reiner could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty, but Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office hasn't decided which to pursue.",
      "A December arraignment was postponed after Reiner appeared in court wearing a suicide prevention smock and shackles. Jackson had said at the time, \"There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case,\" adding that those issues needed to be \"thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined and looked at and analyzed.\"",
      "Since the deaths of the couple, details have emerged about Nick Reiner's struggles with addiction. In 2018, he shared stories on a podcast about how his drug use while traveling cross-country landed him in a hospital, and another about punching walls and destroying a TV after his parents told him he had to leave their guesthouse.",
      "CBS News obtained police records for service calls at the Reiners' Los Angeles home from August 2013 through December. Over those 12 years, the LAPD responded to the address a total of seven times, including twice on the day the Reiners were found dead.",
      "In 2019, police responded once for a welfare check and again for a mental health call for a male. Records did not indicate who the officers made contact with. The remaining three calls were related to minor disturbances in 2013, 2014 and 2017.",
      "The bodies of the Reiners were found in their home on the afternoon of Dec. 14. Several hours later, Nick Reiner was arrested\u00a0outside a gas station convenience store in South L.A. He did not resist arrest, according to police.",
      "Rob and Michele Reiner married in 1989 and had three children together. Their other two children, Jake and Romy Reiner, said in a statement last month that they were experiencing \"unimaginable pain\" after the loss of their parents.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department is sending a team of prosecutors to Minnesota to help investigate allegations of widespread fraud within the state's social services programs, U.S. officials said.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is sending a team of federal prosecutors to Minnesota to help investigate allegations of widespread fraud within the state's social services programs, U.S. officials told CBS News Wednesday.",
      "The department emailed federal prosecutors who work in other U.S. attorney's offices on Tuesday to seek volunteers for the surge, according to a person briefed on the request.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi told CBS News in a statement that the department was sending the prosecutors to Minnesota \"to reinforce our U.S. Attorney's Office and put perpetrators of this widespread fraud behind bars.\"",
      "\"We will deliver severe consequences in Minnesota and stand ready to deploy to any other state where similar fraud schemes are robbing American taxpayers,\" Bondi said.",
      "The Justice Department has intensified efforts to investigate fraud in the state after a social media video shared by YouTuber Nick Shirley went viral right before New Year's Day. Shirley alleged in the video that nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any child care services.",
      "The video has been praised by Bondi, as well as Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk.",
      "The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families has since cast doubt on the accuracy of the video, saying that a review by the state's Office of Inspector General found that nine of the centers were \"operating as expected.\"",
      "A separate CBS analysis, meanwhile, found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months.",
      "One of the Minneapolis day care centers featured in Shirley's video is now closed, according to state records. Quality Learning Center closed Tuesday, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services' licensing records. CBS station WCCO is investigating the reason for the closure, which is not yet publicly known. The center's last licensing review in June found operational violations but noted no evidence of fraud.",
      "Though most of the centers have active licenses, the daycare fraud allegations have taken a toll on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who announced this week he is dropping out of the 2026 gubernatorial race amid rising tensions over his handling of the matter.",
      "The allegations surrounding the daycare facilities are among several fraud cases to hit the state. Federal prosecutors have separately alleged Minnesota is also facing a $9 billion COVID-era fraud scandal \u2014 a figure that state officials have disputed.",
      "The COVID fraud scheme has centered on a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future, and has led to charges against more than 75 defendants.",
      "The group, which works with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools, was accused of sending fake meal-count sheets and invoices.",
      "In response to the fraud allegations, the Trump administration has begun to halt some federal funding to Minnesota. In late December, the Department of Health and Human Services said it has frozen federal child care funding for the state.",
      "An HHS official\u00a0also said it was freezing billions in social services funding for five states led by Democrats, including Minnesota. The administration is withholding $7 billion for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care Development Fund and roughly $870 million for social services grants.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top administration officials on Wednesday announced new dietary guidelines for Americans, recommending against highly processed foods and emphasizing protein and healthy fats.",
      "Kennedy called it \"the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history,\" saying that following the recommendations will boost Americans' overall health and decrease U.S. spending on health care. The new dietary recommendations are a part of the president's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",
      "\"Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy, made possible by President Trump's leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,\" Kennedy said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the updates will \"ensure that Americans have the most accurate, data-driven information supported by science and hard facts, not special interests or partisan ideology.\"",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the U.S. is \"in the middle of the worst chronic health crisis in our nation's history.\" She said over 40% of children in the U.S. are experiencing at least one chronic health condition, and she said the vast majority of health care spending goes toward treating people with chronic diseases.",
      "Rollins said the new guidelines will encourage households and schools to prioritize \"more protein, more dairy, more healthy fats, more whole grains, more fruits and vegetables.\"",
      "\"For decades, decades, under both Republicans and Democrats, federal incentives have promoted low-quality, highly processed foods and pharmaceutical interventions instead of prevention,\" Rollins said. \"... Thankfully, the solution is simple and should be noncontroversial \u2014 eat real food.\"",
      "It's not yet clear how the guidelines will be implemented in schools, prisons and other government facilities.",
      "\"There is a lot of work to do,\" Rollins said. \"Nothing changes overnight.\"",
      "Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said the new dietary guidelines, if followed, could allow Americans to work a year longer and \"jazz up\" the American economy because of that.",
      "Instead of providing specific limit guidelines on alcohol, as past guidelines did, the new language says to decrease alcohol consumption.",
      "\"Alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together,\" Oz said Wednesday. \"In the best case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol. But it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize and there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.\"",
      "\"The implication is, don't have it for breakfast,\" Oz added.",
      "The dietary guidelines come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is overseen by Kennedy's health department, has scaled back recommended childhood immunizations. That decision was met with concern by those in the medical community who fear fewer vaccinations will lead to more illnesses and deaths.",
      "\"We want to maximize the uptake of the vaccines by making sure that Americans know that we are making recommendations that are science-based, that are common sense, that are grounded in science,\" Kennedy said Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week that it will no longer recommend vaccinating children against against hepatitis A,\u00a0hepatitis B\u00a0and rotavirus, despite the CDC's own publications saying the vaccinations have prevented more than 90,000 deaths and almost 2 million hospitalizations across the last three decades.",

    "summary": "The new dietary guidelines recommend limits on added sugars and mention gut health. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans that call for \"prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains\" while avoiding highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.",
      "\"As secretary of Health and Human Services, my message is clear: Eat real food,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a White House briefing announcing the changes alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and other health officials. Kennedy called it \"the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News the new guidelines are \"science-driven.\" In a fact sheet, the administration said the new guidelines would restore \"science and common sense\" and put \"real food back at the center of health.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the new dietary guidelines.",
      "First recommended limits on highly processed foods",
      "For the first time, the recommendations are calling for Americans to avoid eating\u00a0highly processed foods.",
      "A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 55% of the U.S. population receives more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The previous 2020-2025 dietary guidelines did not mention highly processed or ultra-processed foods.",
      "The new guidelines call for avoiding \"highly processed packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,\" as well as avoiding sweetened beverages including soda, fruit drinks and energy drinks.",
      "Research has shown\u00a0diets high in ultra-processed food are associated with an increased risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, according to a review published in\u00a0The BMJ\u00a0medical journal in 2024.",
      "Limits on sugars, artificial flavors and dyes",
      "The guidelines also say that \"no amount of added sugars\" are recommended for Americans, especially children.",
      "At most, a meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars, according to the new guidance. The former guidance said children under 2 should\u00a0not consume added sugars and that Americans should aim to have less than 10% of their daily calories come from added sugars.",
      "People should also limit foods and beverages that include\u00a0artificial flavors, dyes, low-calorie non-nutritive sweeteners and artificial preservatives, the new guidelines said.",
      "Naturally occurring sugars are not considered added sugars and can be part of a recommended diet under the new guidelines.",
      "Fighting chronic disease and supporting gut health",
      "Dietary guidelines are used as the baseline for federal food programs, including SNAP and school meal programs. The fact sheet for the new guidelines says public adherence to the new guidelines \"will dramatically lower chronic disease \u2014 and healthcare costs \u2014 for Americans.\"",
      "The fact sheet said the U.S.'s high level of health-related spending and a life expectancy that is five years less than other developed countries is \"predominantly due to chronic conditions tied to food.\" It also said that lowering rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease would cut about $600 billion in annual healthcare costs. Previous studies have also shown a possible link between diet and Alzheimer's.",
      "\"The most expensive thing we can do as a country is continue government incentives for food that sickens Americans and drives up healthcare costs,\" the fact sheet said.",
      "The new guidelines point out the importance of gut health\u00a0and the microbiome inside a person's intestines. The gut microbiome includes trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi whose balance is important for good health. The new guidelines call for the consumption of vegetables, fruits, fermented foods and high-fiber foods to support a diverse gut microbiome.",
      "\"Ending the war on healthy fats\"",
      "The fact sheet for the new guidance calls for \"ending the war on healthy fats\" and getting the bulk of dietary fats from whole food sources. That includes meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, full-fat dairy and avocados, the guidelines say.",
      "People should aim for three servings of dairy a day, in line with the 2020-2025 guidelines. The new guidelines say people should prioritize full-fat options, while the previous guidelines recommended fat-free or low-fat products.",
      "The new guidelines also recommend olive oil, butter or beef tallow for preparing meals. Kennedy has previously criticized seed oils and extolled tallow, at odds with long-standing recommendations.",
      "In total, saturated fat consumption should not exceed more than 10% of a person's daily calories, according to the new guidelines. The 2020-2025 guidelines also had similar recommended limits on saturated fats, though they noted a \"healthy dietary pattern\" could include vegetable oils.",
      "A focus on protein and \"real\" foods",
      "The new guidelines recommend \"high-quality, nutrient dense protein foods\" including eggs, poultry, seafood, red meat, and plant-based proteins like beans, nuts and seeds in every meal.",
      "Under the guidelines, Americans should aim to eat 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight every day. Proteins should be served with no or limited added sugars, chemical additives, refined carbohydrates or starches, the guidelines say.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary emphasized the importance of protein and said the new guidelines increase the recommended amount for children.",
      "\"Kids need protein,\" Makary said at the briefing. \"The old protein guidelines were to prevent starvation and withering away. These new protein guidelines are designed for American kids to thrive.\"",
      "Fruits, vegetables and whole grains",
      "The new guidelines also recommend people eat at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit per day, in line with the previous 2020-2025 dietary guidance.",
      "People should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, preferably in their original form. Frozen, dried or canned products with no or very limited added sugars \"can also be good options,\" according to the fact sheet. People should limit consumption of 100% fruit or vegetable juices.",
      "Americans should also prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce the consumption of highly processed, refined carbs, the guidelines say. People should aim for between two and four servings of whole grains per day.",
      "Consume less alcohol",
      "The guidelines recommend that Americans should \"consume less alcohol for better overall health.\"",
      "People in certain categories are urged to completely avoid alcohol, including pregnant women, people who are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount they drink, and people taking medications or with medical conditions that can interact with alcohol.",
      "Previous guidelines said that Americans should not drink or drink in moderation. The recommended limits were 2 drinks or less per day for men and 1 drink or less per day for women on days when alcohol is consumed.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the new guidelines are meant to encourage moderation but acknowledge the social benefits that some may experience.",
      "\"There is alcohol on these guidelines, but the implication is don't have it for breakfast,\" Oz said.",
      "Reactions to new dietary guidance",
      "The American Medical Association said in a statement that it \"applauds\" the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines.",
      "\"The guidelines affirm that food is medicine and offer clear direction patients and physicians can use to improve health,\" Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the president of the AMA, said in the statement. Kennedy thanked Mukkamala in his briefing.",
      "The AMA said it will launch a collection of educational resources and hold a series of roundtable discussions with doctors and experts to \"strengthen nutrition education and clinical competency.\" It also pledged to work with Congress to incentivize the consumption of nutrient-dense foods, expand food labeling efforts, define ultra-processed foods and increase investment in nutrition research.",

    "story": [
      "A collection of Steve Jobs' earliest Apple products and personal memorabilia are up for auction to mark the tech company's 50th anniversary.",
      "RR Auction, the Boston-based auction house managing the sales, is now accepting bids on 191 items that include vintage Apple computers, original documents from the company's nascent days and a sizable group of Jobs' childhood belongings, including a set of bowties and Bob Dylan 8-track tapes. Sales opened Tuesday.",
      "One of the auction's focal points is the\u00a0inaugural check issued by Apple Computer, Inc., the company's original name, on March 16, 1976,\u00a0according\u00a0to RR Auction. Signed by Jobs and his Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, the $500 Wells Fargo Bank note was written out to Howard Cantin, who designed the Apple-1 computer's printed circuit board. As the auction house notes, the check predates the company's official founding by 16 days.",
      "\"As the first financial instrument ever drawn on the Apple Computer Company's original account, it is the foundational document that financed the creation of Apple's very first product and brought forth the personal computing revolution,\" reads a description of the item on the RR Auction website.",
      "The check gleaned the Apple anniversary auction's second-highest bid, $32,000, within 24 hours of its opening. But the auction house said it expects the final price will reach $500,000 or higher. The earliest prototype motherboard for the Apple-1 computer had pulled the highest bid, at $55,000, although the auction house estimated it would ultimately sell for at least half a million dollars.",
      "Those relics are accompanied by a range of Apple's earliest products, including a functional Lisa-1 computer, the retro desktop model that preceded the company's Macintosh era, and a first-generation iPhone, which was jailbroken by the teen hacker Geohot.",
      "Jobs' childhood collection was given to RR Auction by his' stepbrother, John Chovanec, according to the auction house. In addition to his bowties and 8-tracks, the group of artifacts also features the wooden desk from Jobs' bedroom at the Los Altos, California, property now known as the site of the \"Apple garage,\" where he and Wozniak assembled the brand's first computers in 1976.",
      "With it are a number of other miscellaneous items that Jobs once owned, like a heat sink and ribbon cable for his personal Apple-1, a series of car repair manuals annotated by hand, and a brief message to his father written on an old Apple business card. There are also Apple marketing posters dating back to the 70s and 80s.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in November found that Lindsey Halligan had been invalidly appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to identify herself as a U.S. attorney despite a different judge finding her appointment as the top federal prosecutor in eastern Virginia was invalid.",
      "U.S. District Judge David Novak, who sits in Richmond, gave Halligan seven days to provide the basis for her use of the title and ordered her to explain why her identification as U.S. attorney \"does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\"",
      "Novak also instructed Halligan to lay out the reasons why the court \"should not strike Ms. Halligan's identification as United States attorney\" from an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in early December. Halligan's name is listed on the indictment and her title as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in November that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and a federal law governing U.S. attorney vacancies. Because of the finding, Currie ordered criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed. The Justice Department appealed the decision, but it has not asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to freeze Currie's ruling while it considers the appeal.",
      "As a result, Novak said the decision \"remains binding precedent in this district and is not subject to being ignored.\"",
      "Shortly after Currie's ruling, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia received orders to keep Halligan's title of U.S. attorney on all pleadings, claiming that the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had approved it, according to an email reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In the email, prosecutors were told to list her as both United States Attorney and Special United States Attorney, with the word \"Attorney\" misspelled in the first title. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order in October that purported to retroactively appoint Halligan as special attorney, effective Sept. 22.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's legal team in a civil case arising from former special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in January 2021. She then joined Mr. Trump at the White House after he won a second term in November 2024.",
      "Halligan was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September after Erik Siebert, who was the top prosecutor for the region, abruptly left the post amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Days after she was appointed, Halligan sought and secured a two-count indictment against Comey alleging he lied to Congress during testimony in September 2020. James, the New York attorney general, was indicted on bank fraud charges in early October. Both pleaded not guilty and sought to have their respective indictments dismissed on numerous grounds, including the validity of Halligan's appointment.",
      "The statute invoked by the Trump administration to appoint Halligan allows an interim U.S. attorney to serve for 120 days. Their tenure can then be extended by the U.S. district court judges for the region.",
      "But Currie found that Halligan's appointment was not consistent with that framework because the 120-day clock started running when Siebert was appointed in January. When that timeframe expired, Attorney General Pam Bondi's authority to appoint an interim U.S. attorney did too, the judge found.",
      "Currie found that Halligan had been serving unlawfully since Sept. 22 and concluded that \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment\" had to be set aside.",

    "summary": "Six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases are no longer being recommended for all children by the CDC.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government has drastically scaled back the number of recommended childhood immunizations, sidelining six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases, long-term disability, and death.",
      "Just three of the six immunizations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will no longer routinely recommend \u2014 against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rotavirus \u2014 have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and more than 90,000 deaths in the past 30 years, according to the CDC's own publications.",
      "Vaccines against the three diseases, as well as those against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, and COVID, are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after \"shared clinical decision-making,\" or consultation between doctors and parents.",
      "The CDC maintained its recommendations for 11 childhood vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella; whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria; the bacterial disease known as Hib; pneumonia; polio; chickenpox; and human papillomavirus, or HPV.",
      "Federal and private insurance will still cover vaccines for the diseases the CDC no longer recommends universally, according to a Department of Health and Human Services fact sheet; parents who want to vaccinate their children against those diseases will not have to pay out-of-pocket.",
      "Experts on childhood disease were baffled by the change in guidance. HHS said the changes followed \"a scientific review of the underlying science\" and were in line with vaccination programs in other developed nations.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, pointed to Denmark as a model. But the schedules of most European countries are closer to the U.S. standard upended by the new guidance.",
      "For example, Denmark, which does not vaccinate against rotavirus, registers around 1,200 infant and toddler rotavirus hospitalizations a year. That rate, in a country of 6 million, is about the same as it was in the United States before vaccination.",
      "\"They're OK with having 1,200 or 1,300 hospitalized kids, which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of childhood suffering,\" said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a licensed rotavirus vaccine. \"We weren't. They should be trying to emulate us, not the other way around.\"",
      "Public health officials say the new guidance puts the onus on parents to research and understand each childhood vaccine and why it is important.",
      "Here's a rundown of the diseases the sidelined vaccines prevent:",
      "RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S.",
      "The respiratory virus usually spreads in fall and winter and produces cold-like symptoms, though it can be deadly for young children, causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths a year. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, roughly 80% of children younger than 2 who are hospitalized with RSV have no identifiable risk factors. Long-awaited vaccines against the disease were introduced in 2023.",
      "Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccination, which was phased in beginning in the late 1990s and recommended for all toddlers starting in 2006, has led to a more than 90% drop in the disease since 1996. The foodborne virus, which causes a wretched illness, continues to plague adults, particularly people who are homeless or who abuse drugs or alcohol, with a total of 1,648 cases and 85 deaths reported in 2023.",
      "Hepatitis B. The disease causes liver cancer, cirrhosis, and other serious illnesses and is particularly dangerous when contracted by babies and young children. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and can survive on surfaces for a week. From 1990 to 2019, vaccination resulted in a 99% decline in reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children and teens. Liver cancer among American children has also plummeted as a result of universal childhood vaccination. But the hepatitis B virus is still around, with 2,000-3,000 acute cases reported annually among unvaccinated adults. More than 17,000 chronic hepatitis B diagnoses were reported in 2023. The CDC estimates about half of people infected don't know they have it.",
      "Rotavirus. Before routine administration of the current rotavirus vaccines began in 2006, about 70,000 young children were hospitalized and 50 died every year from the virus. It was known as \"winter vomiting syndrome,\" said Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado. \"It was a miserable disease that we hardly see anymore.\"",
      "The virus is still common on surfaces that babies touch, however, and \"if you lower immunization rates it will once again hospitalize children,\" Offit said.",
      "Meningococcal vaccines. These have been required mainly for teenagers and college students, who are notably vulnerable to critical illness caused by the bacteria. About 600 to 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the U.S. each year, but it kills more than 10% of those it sickens, and 1 in 5 survivors have permanent disabilities.",
      "Flu and COVID. The two respiratory viruses have each killed hundreds of children in recent years \u2014 though both tend to be much more severe in older adults. Flu is currently on the upswing in the United States, and last flu season the virus killed 289 children.",
      "What is shared clinical decision-making?",
      "Under the changes, decisions about vaccinating children against influenza, COVID, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, and hepatitis A and B will now rely on what officials call \"shared clinical decision-making,\" meaning families will have to consult with a health care provider to determine whether a vaccine is appropriate.",
      "\"It means a provider should have a conversation with the patient to lay out the risks and the benefits and make a decision for that individual person,\" said Lori Handy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "In the past, the CDC used that term only in reference to narrow circumstances, like whether a person in a monogamous relationship needed the HPV vaccine, which prevents a sexually transmitted infection and certain cancers.",
      "The CDC's new approach doesn't line up with the science because of the proven protective benefit the vaccines have for the vast majority of the population, Handy said.",
      "In their report justifying the changes, HHS officials Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg and Martin Kulldorff said the U.S. vaccination system requires more safety research and more parental choice. Eroding trust in public health caused in part by an overly large vaccine schedule had led more parents to shun vaccination against major threats like measles, they said.",
      "The vaccines on the schedule that the CDC has altered were backed up by extensive safety research when they were evaluated and approved by the FDA.",
      "\"They're held to a safety standard higher than any other medical intervention that we have,\" Handy said. \"The value of routine recommendations is that it really helps the public understand that this has been vetted upside down and backwards in every which way.\"",
      "Eric Ball, a pediatrician in Orange County, California, said the change in guidance will cause more confusion among parents who think it means a vaccine's safety is in question.",
      "\"It is critical for public health that recommendations for vaccines are very clear and concise,\" Ball said. \"Anything to muddy the water is just going to lead to more children getting sick.\"",
      "Ball said that instead of focusing on a child's individual health needs, he often has to spend limited clinic time reassuring parents that vaccines are safe. A \"shared clinical decision-making\" status for a vaccine has no relationship to safety concerns, but parents may think it does.",
      "HHS' changes do not affect state vaccination laws and therefore should allow prudent medical practitioners to carry on as before, said Richard Hughes IV, an attorney and a George Washington University lecturer who is leading litigation against Kennedy over vaccine changes.",
      "\"You could expect that any pediatrician is going to follow sound evidence and recommend that their patients be vaccinated,\" he said. The law protects providers who follow professional care guidelines, he said, and \"RSV, meningococcal, and hepatitis remain serious health threats for children in this country.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",
      "Wiprud said that at that point, she didn't know what was wrong. Instinct took over, and she and the captain started working to land safely.",
      "\"I didn't know that there was a hole in the airplane until we landed,\" Wiprud said. \"I knew something was catastrophically wrong.\"",
      "The 2-foot-by-4-foot piece of fuselage covering an unused emergency exit behind the left wing had blown out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, including the two seats closest to the opening.",
      "A teen aboard the flight\u00a0had his shirt ripped off his body.\u00a0 Multiple objects, including the\u00a0phones of two passengers, Wiprud's headset and multiple aircraft components, were sucked out of the aircraft.",
      "Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later.",
      "\"All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,\" she recalled. \"As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Boeing factory workers told NTSB investigators they felt pressured to work too fast and were asked to perform jobs they weren't qualified for.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit describes how he and the first officer acted quickly after losing cabin pressure when the panel blew out to fly the plane safely back to Portland while decreasing altitude and working with air traffic controllers to avoid any other planes in the area.",
      "The airline didn't answer a question about whether Fisher is still flying for them, and the lawsuit described him as a citizen and well-respected member of the aviation community. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether he is still working as a pilot.",
      "Working to improve safety",
      "The head of the commercial airplane unit at Boeing at the time, Stan Deal, commended the Alaska Airlines crew for safely landing the plane in a memo to employees after the incident.",
      "Boeing did not comment directly on this new lawsuit. But the company's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has made improving safety a top priority ever since he took over the top job at Boeing in August 2024.",
      "The FAA fined Boeing $3.1 million over safety violations inspectors found after the door plug incident. In October, the agency allowed Boeing to increase production of the 737 Max to 42 planes a month because inspectors were satisfied with the measures the company had taken to improve safety.",
      "Alaska Airlines also declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline remains \"grateful to our crew members for the bravery and quick-thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"",
      "Kris  Van Cleave\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "A judge granted a request for resentencing by Charles Williams, the gunman in a deadly 2001 shooting at a San Diego high school, potentially allowing him to be freed after 23 years in prison.",
    "story": [
      "A judge granted a request Tuesday by the gunman in a 2001 shooting at a San Diego high school to be resentenced, potentially allowing him to be freed after 23 years in prison.",
      "Charles \"Andy\" Williams, who was 15 at the time, pleaded guilty to killing two students and injuring 13 others after opening fire with his father's revolver at Santana High School on March 5, 2001. He was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison.",
      "The decision by \u00a0San Diego Superior Court Judge Lisa Rodriguez meant Williams' case would be sent to juvenile court and lead to his immediate release from prison without parole supervision or evaluation, according to San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan's office.",
      "Rodriguez said she had to follow the law, not the emotion surrounding the case, according to CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV.",
      "Prosecutors immediately challenged the ruling in an appellate court to try to stop Williams' release, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.",
      "\"As prosecutors, our duty is to ensure justice for victims and protect public safety, and the defendant's cruel actions in this case continue to warrant the 50-years-to-life sentence that was imposed,\" Stephan said. \"At some point our laws must balance the rights of defendants, the rights of victims, and the rights of the community to be safe.\"",
      "Williams' attorney Laura Sheppard remarked after the hearing that she thinks \"it was the right ruling,\" the Union-Tribune said. \"I'm grateful that Judge Rodriguez was able to put away emotional reasoning and base her decision on the law,\" she continued.",
      "Williams attended the hearing virtually from prison but could be seen on a large monitor in the courtroom, the newspaper said, adding that as Rodriguez issued her ruling, Williams appeared to cry.",
      "Williams killed two students, 14-year-old Bryan Zuckor and 17-year-old Randy Gordon. He wounded 11 students and two staff members.",
      "Now age 39, he is being held at the California Institution for Men in Chino and became eligible for parole in September 2024.",
      "He was denied parole that year after being deemed an \"unreasonable risk to public safety\" by a state board, the Union-Tribune reported. The board also said it was unclear if Williams understood why he committed the shooting.",
      "Prosecutors say Williams' case has been transferred to juvenile court for a disposition hearing. Due to his age at the time of his shooting, his convictions will be redesignated as juvenile \"true findings,\" after which he would be released from prison and potentially placed on juvenile probation, prosecutors said.",
      "Williams was able to petition for resentencing due to a law enacted in 2011 that allowed judges to give juvenile offenders with life without parole sentences a chance to be resentenced. An appeals court decision in 2022 made those with the \"functional equivalent\" of life without parole sentences eligible as well.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 21:21:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Two U.S. intelligence officials said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing Soviet-era defense systems and armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces planned to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans told CBS News Monday.",
      "Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News Tuesday that Russia had sent a submarine and other Russian naval vessels to escort the tanker Marinera, which sails under a Russian flag. The Wall Street Journal was first to\u00a0report\u00a0on the escort.",
      "It is unclear where the U.S. plans stood now that Russian naval assets had been dispatched. It is not uncommon for military operations to be shelved entirely.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning had said Monday the interdiction mission could come as early as this week, but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "On Monday, The New York Times reported that at least 16 oil tankers have attempted to evade the U.S. naval blockade by disguising their geographical locations or turning off their transmission beacons.",
      "If the Marinera is captured by American forces, it would be the third oil tanker seized by the United States since it began its campaign against Venezuela in early September.",

      "Denmark has long rebuffed the Trump administration's interest in Greenland, reiterating that rebuke this week.

    "summary": "Aldrich Ames was a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Aldrich Ames, a counterintelligence officer for the CIA who spied for the Soviet Union and later Russia, has died, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson.",
      "Ames, who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, died Monday at the age of 84 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Maryland.",
      "The 31-year veteran of the CIA is believed to have compromised more than 100 intelligence operations and sent a number of Soviet agents to their deaths or prison, as he traded information for large sums of money that funded his lavish lifestyle.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ames admitted that he compromised \"virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me\" as well as giving the Soviet Union and Russia a \"huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies.\" Ames divulged the identities of 10 agents, and at least nine of them were executed, according to the Defense Department.",
      "There were a number of red flags throughout Ames' career \u2014 lie detector tests that showed deceptive answers, sudden unexplained wealth, poor job performance, alcohol abuse \u2014 but the CIA repeatedly missed or ignored the warning signs and promoted him to increasingly sensitive posts.",
      "Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, in 1941, Ames spent part of his childhood in Southeast Asia while his father worked for the CIA.",
      "After graduating high school and failing out of classes at the University of Chicago, Ames joined the CIA in 1962, performing clerical duties. At the same time, he attended George Washington University, graduating in 1967 with a degree in history.",
      "In 1969, he married his first wife, who also worked for the CIA, and accepted his first assignment abroad in Ankara, Turkey, where he targeted Soviet spies for recruitment. But he was sent back to CIA headquarters in Virginia after three years when his job performance declined.",
      "Back in the U.S., Ames' problems with alcohol began to surface at work and his marriage fell apart.",
      "Ames went alone to his assignment in Mexico City, where he worked from 1981 to 1983. There, he met his next wife, Rosario, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Colombian Embassy and a CIA asset, who would later be charged as his accomplice.",
      "Despite several security violations over the years, including leaving a briefcase on a train in New York that contained classified materials that could have compromised a Soviet asset, and his superiors' concerns about his heavy drinking, Ames was promoted to chief of the Soviet branch of the counterintelligence division.",
      "By then, financial pressure was building on Ames. The divorce from his first wife had left him in debt and he had new bills to pay once Rosario came to live with him.",
      "So, in 1985, he approached the Soviets, giving them the names of a few KGB officers secretly working for the FBI in exchange for $50,000. He later gave the KGB a list of CIA assets, dealing \"a crippling blow\" to the agency's Soviet operations, according to a 1994 Senate Intelligence Committee report. The KGB promised to give him more than $2 million for his cooperation. To tamp down suspicions about his newfound wealth, he told colleagues that Rosario came from a wealthy family.",
      "He continued spying for nine more years, including in Rome, where he served from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 to 1994, he oversaw operations in Western Europe and Czechoslovakia and worked for the CIA's counternarcotics center, traveling to meet his handlers in Vienna, Bogota and Caracas.",
      "Meanwhile, the CIA and FBI were looking for the source of the damaging compromises. In 1993, the mole hunt closed in on Ames. Investigators surveilled him for months, arresting him on Feb. 21, 1994, in Arlington, Virginia, days before he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow.",
      "Nearly two months later, Ames and his wife pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their espionage activities. Ames' wife was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "Then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey\u00a0said Ames was \"a malignant betrayer of his country who killed a number of people who helped the United States and the West win the Cold War.\" Those agents died, Woolsey said, because a \"murdering traitor wanted a bigger house and a Jaguar.\"",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0New York Times after his arrest, Ames explained his decision to start spying for the other side, saying money was the main motivator. But he also said the seed was planted when he regularly had lunch with a correspondent of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in the 1970s. The Soviet threat was not as great as the U.S made it out to be, he determined.",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. carried out operations Wednesday to seize two oil tankers linked to Venezuela \u2014 one in the North Atlantic and one in the Caribbean Sea, officials said.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure\u00a0of the Marinera, a Venezuela-linked oil tanker formerly known as Bella-1. It said the vessel was seized for violations of U.S. sanctions and pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro.",
      "Two Defense Department officials told CBS News Navy SEALs took over the oil tanker. They were flown by service members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the \"Night Stalkers.\"",
      "The U.S. has been following the tanker since last month, and CBS News first reported on Monday that American forces were planning to intercept it. The pursuit began during a pressure campaign on former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces last weekend. Two other oil tankers were seized by the U.S. last month.",
      "U.S. officials also announced on Wednesday that \"a stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\" was seized before dawn in the Caribbean. U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X that the intercepted vessel, M/T Sophia, was \"conducting illicit activities\" and operating in international waters.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Sophia was flying a Cameroonian flag and left Venezuela with oil on board. The U.S. judged the ship to be in violation of its embargo on Venezuela. The officials said the U.S. has full control of the vessel and no U.S. personnel were injured in the operation. The U.S. Coast Guard was escorting the vessel to the U.S. \"for final disposition,\" according to U.S. Southern Command.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem, who posted video of one of the interceptions on social media, described the operations as \"back-to-back\" and \"meticulously coordinated,\" adding that the vessels were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it.",
      "The Marinera, formerly Bella-1",
      "The Marinera \u2014 which has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department \u2014 was sailing under the Russian flag. It was previously flagged out of Panama. Like other tankers that were seized, it was sanctioned by U.S. authorities for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading.",
      "A Russian submarine and other naval vessels had been deployed to escort the tanker as the U.S. followed it, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Noem said the tanker \"has been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, even changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the tanker a Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel. \"The vessel was deemed stateless after flying a false flag,\" she said.",
      "Russia responded to the seizure, with its Ministry of Transport saying on the messaging platform Telegram Wednesday that the vessel had been \"granted temporary permission to sail under the State Flag of the Russian Federation, issued in accordance with Russian legislation and the norms of international law,\" \"In accordance with the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" the ministry said.",
      "The ministry said that U.S. naval forces boarded the Marinera at 3 p.m. Moscow time Wednesday and that communication with the ship was later lost.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping\u00a0lists\u00a0the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that the Russian government officially had asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said earlier this week that the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and that the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "Ships like the Marinera and The Skipper are part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",

    "summary": "Denmark and Greenland requested a meeting with Marco Rubio, which one Danish lawmaker hopes will halt talk \"about wanting to acquire Greenland.\"",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would meet with Danish officials next week, after the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark requested to confer \"as soon as possible,\" lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Brask said he was\u00a0\"guessing that it will be a matter of putting facts right, and stop the misinformation and stop talking about wanting to acquire Greenland.\u00a0Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "The request comes after Rubio told U.S. lawmakers Monday that the Trump administration's goal was to buy the island, not take it by force, according to a lawmaker and a source familiar with his congressional briefing.",
      "The Trump administration has not, however, taken the option of using the U.S. military off the table to meet its stated objective of \"acquiring Greenland,\" as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Tuesday.",
      "\"You can't buy another country or a population. You can't buy people, of course. And when we see the different images from United States of the president, for example, laughing when he's talking about Greenland \u2026 this is really something that is pissing people off in Greenland, to be honest and to be quite frank,\" Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark's Parliament, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"If you want to collaborate with us and with the Greenlanders, you need to respect us first and foremost.\"",
      "Chemnitz said the U.S. was using \"completely wrong tactics\" to engage with Greenland and called it \"appalling\" that the White House was \"not ruling out that annexation of our country is on the table.\"",
      "Both politicians emphasized that Greenland has always communicated to the U.S. that it is \"open for business,\" as far as American commercial interests in the region.",
      "\"Business development is something that Greenland is responsible for ourselves, and, therefore, it's something that we could do today if we wanted to,\" Chemnitz told CBS News.",
      "\"You can explore, of course, if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis,\" said Brask. \"There won't be any hold back on that.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News that thus far U.S. companies have been dissuaded from investing in Greenland's minerals because of the belief that the costs of mining forays on the vast, largely frozen island would outweigh the potential profits.",
      "\"With few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said.",
      "The U.S. seeking control of Greenland, \"to get the strategic minerals is also a bit strange, given that nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "As for U.S. defense interests in Greenland, which President Trump has always stressed as a primary driver of his desire to control the island, Brask told CBS News there have been few hurdles to deepening such ties in the past, and very few at present.",
      "\"You put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc., just by asking, you can,\" he said, referring to the United States. \"It's not you running the country, but you have the options, the possibility of having troops, material \u2026 equipment in Greenland, you just have to ask.\"",
      "The U.S. has maintained one military base in Greenland, the Pituffik Space Base, which supports important missile warning and defense systems, and is the site of radar and satellite surveillance systems.",
      "\"Throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland, and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold war ended. So in a sense, I think it's just worth keeping that in mind when Donald Trump is out saying Denmark is a bad ally and everything,\" Olesen told CBS News. \"It's tasks that the U.S. used to be happy to handle itself. That's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",

      "Iran executed a man by hanging on Wednesday who was convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, the country's state-run IRNA news agency said. The news came as the Islamic Republic's leaders grappled for ways to end continuing street protests that have drawn a threat of U.S. intervention by President Trump.",
      "Ali Ardestani was hanged Wednesday after being convicted of providing Israeli intelligence \"with images and photos of specific locations and information on target subjects, and received amounts in the form of digital currency at the end of each mission,\" IRNA said.",
      "Iranian authorities hold trials behind closed doors, and no evidence against Ardestani was made public. Iran executed more than 1,000 people last year\u2014 the highest number of executions in the country since 1989, according to Amnesty International.",
      "The latest execution comes as Iran's hardline Islamic clerical rulers face the most significant domestic unrest seen in the country in several years. Nationwide protests against the autocratic regime entered their 11th day on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), set up by Iranian human rights activists, says nearly 40 people have been killed since the protests began.",
      "The unrest started as business owners in Tehran vented frustration over spiraling inflation and the cost of basic goods in Iran, where the economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years, but it escalated quickly into the widest protests seen in the country since 2022.",
      "Trump's warning over protesters lingers as Iran tries to quell unrest",
      "On Sunday, President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the U.S. could hit Iran \"very hard\" if protesters are not protected. \"We're watching it very closely,\" Mr. Trump said. He'd said two days earlier that if Iran \"violently kills protesters,\" the U.S. would \"come to their rescue.\"",
      "So far, there's been no overt sign of the U.S. following through on these threats, even as the reported death toll from the protests climbs, and no further comment from the White House about what actions by the Iranian regime might actually trigger a response.",
      "In an effort to quell the internal pressure, Iran's government announced economic measures over the weekend to help Iranian citizens make ends meet, and state media said Wednesday that President Mahsoud Pezeshkian had ordered security forces not to attack peaceful demonstrators.",

      "Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said the new assistance measures, among other things, would triple national subsidies for regular households to buy basic goods, according to the state-controlled Mehr News Agency.",
      "The primary benefit, expected to begin Wednesday, would effectively triple the amount Iranians are given by the government to buy basic food items, adding the equivalent of about $7 more per month on top of existing subsidies for food, based on current exchange rates.",
      "One Iranian told CBS News on Wednesday that the subsidy increase wouldn't be enough.",

    "story": [
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul said Wednesday he opposes any U.S. military action in Greenland as the White House says it is exploring all options for acquisition of the territory.",
      "\"It won't happen under my watch,\" Paul said on \"CBS Mornings\" about military action in Greenland. \"I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\"",
      "The Kentucky senator, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has long opposed offensive U.S. military action overseas. He voted to advance a war powers resolution, which would have limited the president's authority to continue a military campaign in Venezuela, but Senate Republicans blocked the measure. The Trump administration did not seek congressional approval before launching last week's strikes. The Senate is expected to bring up a war powers resolution again this week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of President Trump's interest in Greenland that he and his team are \"discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\"",
      "Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. A lawmaker and a source familiar with the discussions said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of Congress at briefing Tuesday that Mr. Trump would buy Greenland and not take it by force.",
      "Paul did not raise an objection to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "\"Half of the United States came to us through the Louisiana Purchase,\" Paul noted. \"Alaska came to us through a purchase. But you didn't get to those purchases like any deal or diplomacy by insulting your opponent. You get there by actually trying to please and get your opponent to agree to this, because it would have to be done voluntarily.\"",
      "Paul said that this type of action in Greenland would have to be initiated by a vote from its more than 50,000 citizens declaring their independence from Denmark, adding, \"I think the people of Greenland are inclined to do\" this.",
      "That would also have to be followed by \"some sort of offer of something that makes it better to be a part of the United States,\" he continued.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the strikes in Venezuela, Paul suggested it marked the beginning of the \"Don-roe doctrine,\" leading to questions about expansion extending to other territories, including Greenland and Canada.",
      "Paul said that he had \"never thought about\" taking Greenland, but \"now that it's been brought up, if you want to effect that, you don't do it by beating people up the same way, like in regard to Canada.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to Canada the \"51st state\" and imposed punishing tariffs against the U.S.' northern neighbor, raising tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Paul said he's been consistent about his opposition to military action overseas, and he stressed the importance of maintaining Congress' constitutional authority to declare war.",
      "\"I think that this is an important debate to have,\" Paul said. \"Doesn't mean I have anything against President Trump. It doesn't mean that I don't even dislike the result of (former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s) Maduro gone \u2026 But I do think the constitutional debate is an important one.\"",

    "summary": "At least 36 people have reportedly been killed in Iran amid anti-government protests across the nation, putting its rulers under pressure as Trump threatens to intervene.",
    "story": [
      "At least 36 people have been killed amid major anti-government demonstrations across Iran, a U.S.-based rights group says. The Iranian government is trying to quell the unrest, and reacted angrily to President Trump's veiled threat of a U.S. armed intervention.",
      "The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which gave the death toll based on its network of contacts in the country, said in its daily report on Tuesday that at least 36 people \"have been confirmed killed during the past ten days of protests. Among them were four individuals under the age of 18, as well as two members of security and law enforcement forces.\"",
      "HRANA said more than 2,000 protesters had been arrested, \"however, the actual number of detainees is estimated to be significantly higher.\"",
      "The organization shared video on Tuesday that it said showed clashes between protesters and security forces at Tehran's Grand Bazaar \u2014 a center of commerce in the capital where shop owners have long backed the regime.",
      "The protests began more than a week ago in Tehran as business owners took to the streets to vent their frustration over soaring inflation in the nation, whose economy has been crippled by U.S. and international sanctions for years. But the anger spread quickly to more than 250 locations in at least 27 of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the Washington-based HRANA, with social media videos showing violent clashes between protesters chanting anti-government slogans and security forces every night since.",
      "People who spoke with CBS News from inside the country on Tuesday said the latest demonstrations in the capital were relatively small, corroborating other reports that efforts by the Iranian authorities to placate the protesters have likely had some effect in reducing numbers in recent days.",
      "President Trump said Friday \u2014 a day before American forces attacked Venezuela and captured the country's longtime leader Nicolas Maduro \u2014 that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded and ready,\" warning that if Iran \"violently kills protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't offered any further detail on his threat, but he's been ratcheting up pressure on Tehran since taking office for his second term, including with unprecedented U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear facilities in June as Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent Iranian news website IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday, referring to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "Iranian officials have not confirmed the deaths of any protesters, and while acknowledging the demonstrations and economic pain felt in the country, they make little mention of the violence seen on the streets and accuse the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest. The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency claimed Monday that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "The U.S. State Department has issued statements condemning specific incidents in Iran since Mr. Trump leveled his ambiguous threat, but the chances of an American intervention remained unclear on Tuesday.",
      "As has long been the case with Iran, the uncertainty left space for rumors to swirl. There were unconfirmed reports that the country's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was considering escaping into exile in Russia if the protests escalated out of control.",
      "Other reports have speculated that the government could even launch a new attack on Israel \u2014 something the regime has said it is ready for since the 12-day war in June \u2014 in a bid to divert attention away from domestic problems and refocus the population's anger at Iran's biggest foreign adversary, which would likely respond quickly and harshly.",
      "But Iran's intelligence services have a history of leaking false information to the media, especially foreign outlets, to create an exaggerated narrative that the country's leaders can then deny and portray as deliberate Western disinformation.",
      "In the meantime, the government has tried to quash the unrest on the streets not only with security forces, but with a series of measures aimed at showing sympathy with the protesters, including freezing some commodity prices and taxes on businesses, and even a dramatic move Monday to announce cash subsidies for essential goods for all households.",
      "The government does appear to have been bracing for unrest in the wake of the summer war with Israel, which constrained its sanctions-squeezed budgets even further and forced slashes to subsidies and social services.",
      "So far, however, even if the protests haven't continued escalating \u2014   which is difficult to gauge as Iran's government tightly controls the flow of information inside the country \u2014   the efforts to quell the unrest haven't fully succeeded.",
      "In the meantime, the demonstrations continue, as people wait for any further signals from Mr. Trump that he might be willing to try to take advantage of a vulnerable moment for the Islamic Republic's rulers.",

      "The 56-year-old has long been seen as a loyal confidant and protege of the now-deposed Venezuelan leader, and a member of a cadre accused by Washington for many years of helping Maduro maintain his authoritarian grip on power.",
      "It remains unclear if Rodr\u00edguez and the Trump administration might find a way to work together, and thus whether she might remain in power to some degree following Mr. Trump's assertion that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela for some unspecified period.",
      "Mr. Trump warned after Maduro's capture that if Rodr\u00edguez \"doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"",
      "Diosdado Cabello",
      "Another stalwart of the Maduro regime is Diosdado Cabello, who currently serves as Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, giving him oversight of the country's police and prisons.",
      "Cabello previously served as vice president, and for many years as president of the country's parliament. He also spent years in command of Venezuelan intelligence services.",
      "Like Maduro, he has been indicted on criminal charges in the United States, accused of helping to traffic more than 5 tons of cocaine to the U.S.",
      "He was first charged in 2020 with various federal drugs and weapons offenses in an indictment filed in the same Southern District of New York where Maduro was arraigned. The indictment named Cabello as a senior figure in the Cartel del los Soles, which Maduro is accused of leading.",
      "He was hit with further charges in a superceding indictment filed as the U.S. launched the attack on Venezuela. He's been described as the \"chief thug\" in terms of running Venezuela's domestic security forces, who helped keep Maduro in power, and the indictment lays out his alleged ties to drug cartels.",
      "Cabello could be among the targets of further U.S. military and law enforcement action, the source told CBS News' Brennan on Wednesday.",
      "There is a U.S. government reward of $25 million on offer for information leading to Cabello's capture.",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, currently serving as Venezuela's Minister of Defense, is also accused of direct involvement in trafficking drugs into the U.S.",
      "The U.S. accuses him of allowing the safe passage of commercial flights carrying illegal drugs, and of collecting a protection fee for doing so, and he was indicted in a federal court in Washington D.C. in 2020.",
      "Padrino, who has longstanding ties with Russia, also has a U.S. bounty on his head, with a $15 million reward on offer.",
      "Jorge Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The new interim president's brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, has served as President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, the country's Maduro-controlled legislature, since 2021. He's also considered a key figure in the regime.",
      "\"My main function in the days to come... as president of this National Assembly, will be to resort to all procedures, all platforms, and all avenues to bring back Nicolas Maduro Moros, my brother, my president,\" Jorge Rodriguez told lawmakers.",
      "Just like his sister, Rodr\u00edguez has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury over his alleged role in undermining democracy in Venezuela and propping up Maduro's authoritarian regime.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 Brigitte Bardot's funeral was being held on Wednesday with a private service and a public homage in Saint-Tropez, the French Riviera resort where she lived for more than half a century after retiring from movie stardom at the height of her fame.",
      "The animal rights activist and far-right supporter died on Dec. 28 at the age of 91 at her home in southern France.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron said after her death that France was \"mourning a legend.\"",
      "She died from cancer after undergoing two operations, her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine released Tuesday evening. \"She was conscious and concerned about the fate of animals until the very end,\" he said.",
      "Residents and admirers applauded the funeral convoy as the coffin of Bardot, once one of the world's most photographed women and a defining screen siren of the 1960s, was being carried through the town's narrow streets.",
      "A service started to the sound of Maria Callas' \"Ave Maria\" at the Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption Catholic Church in the presence of Bardot's husband, son and grandchildren, as well as guests invited by the family and the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered in the small town to follow the farewell on large screens set up at the port and on two plazas.",
      "After the church service, Bardot is to be buried \"in the strictest privacy\" at a cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, according to the Saint-Tropez town hall.",
      "She had long called Saint-Tropez her refuge from the celebrity that once made her a household name.",
      "A public homage will take place at a nearby site for admirers of the woman whose image once symbolized France's postwar liberation and sensuality.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most dazzling ambassador,\" the town hall said last week. \"Through her presence, personality and aura, she marked the history of our town.\"",
      "Bardot settled decades ago in her seaside villa, La Madrague, and retired from filmmaking in 1973 at age 39, during an international career that spanned more than two dozen films.",
      "She later emerged as an animal rights activist, founding and sustaining a foundation devoted to the protection of animals.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest recognition.",
      "While she withdrew from the film industry, she remained a highly visible and often controversial public figure through decades of militant animal rights activism and links with far-right politics.",
      "She will be buried in the so-called marine cemetery, where her parents are also interred.",
      "The cemetery, overlooking the Mediterranean sea, is also the final resting place of several cultural figures, including filmmaker Roger Vadim, Bardot's first husband, who directed her breakout film \"And God Created Woman,\" a role that made her a worldwide star.",

      "President Trump isn't denying the possibility of further American expansion, intervention or annexation efforts in the Western Hemisphere after the military's success in plucking former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from Caracas over the weekend to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S.",
      "In the past, he's threatened to annex Greenland and Canada and predicted the governments in Cuba and Colombia would fall. Now, Mr. Trump is making similar comments again and raising new questions about what he plans to do next.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that under his administration, \"American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again\" \u2014 dubbing his approach the \"Don-roe Doctrine,\" a spin on the 19th century foreign policy concept.",
      "It's not clear whether the president will act on his threats against other countries.",
      "Here's the latest on countries and territories that have been the subject of interventionist comments by the president:",
      "Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump has long coveted Greenland and has said it's necessary for U.S. national security, a point he made again Sunday.",
      "\"We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" he said. \"We need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security.\"",
      "\"Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"To boost up security in Greenland, they added one more dogsled.\"",
      "Administration officials are discussing a \"range of options\" to acquire Greenland, including using military force, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "The president also named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as special envoy to Greenland last month to represent U.S. interests on the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Landry said in a social media post addressed to Mr. Trump, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "In March, Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland and told a reporter while he was there that \"what we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "A post on Saturday by Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, showed Greenland covered in an American flag accompanied by the comment \"Soon,\" which prompted some to wonder if its annexation is on the horizon.",
      "Asked by CNN on Monday if he could rule out that the U.S. is going to try to take Greenland by force, Stephen Miller said, \"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking \u2014 of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One over the weekend that while nothing is imminent, \"we'll worry about Greenland in about two months. Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen chided Mr. Trump in a social media post, calling suggestions of annexation \"fantasies\" and writing: \"That's enough now.\"",
      "On Tuesday, the leaders of Europe issued a statement saying \"security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.\"",
      "Iran",
      "Escalating protests over the desperate economic conditions in Iran have been taking place for over a week, and there have been reports that dozens of people have been killed. In response, hours before the Venezuela operation began, Mr. Trump posted on social media that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\" He said the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"",
      "The president said Sunday of the demonstrations in Iran, \"We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.\"",
      "In June, the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Iran's major nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, in an effort to destroy its nuclear enrichment capacity.",
      "Cuba",
      "On the way back to Washington Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"Cuba looks like it's ready to fall,\" adding that he didn't know \"if they're going to hold out.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks Saturday indicated Cuba's leaders should be worried: \"If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit.\" A day later, on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" he said of Cuba, \"they're in a lot of trouble.\"",
      "Though he didn't detail any plans for Cuba or its leaders, Rubio said, \"I don't think it's any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime, who, by the way, are the ones that were propping up Maduro.\"",
      "Rubio highlighted the close ties between Venezuela and Cuba, noting that Maduro had relied on Cuban bodyguards for protection and said they were in charge of the Venezuelan government's \"internal intelligence.\" The Cuban government said 32 Cubans were killed during the military operation to capture Maduro.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump seems content to see how things play out on the island.",
      "\"I don't think we need any action\" in Cuba, he said, pointing out that Cuba \"now has no income \u2014 they got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They're not getting any of it. And Cuba literally is ready to fall.\"",
      "In the past year, Cuba's oil imports from Venezuela fell by 15%, to 27,400 barrels per day, according to Reuters, which also said that Cuba's supply from Mexico over the same period, from January to October, had dropped by 73%, to just 5,000 bpd.",
      "Colombia",
      "The president appears to have less patience for Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whom he has accused of illegal drug production and trafficking.",
      "\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday. Asked whether he was threatening to undertake a military operation in Colombia, the president replied, \"It sounds good to me. You know what \u2026 they kill a lot of people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that cocaine production has spiked during Petro's presidency, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced sanctions on Petro in October because he \"has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.\"",
      "Petro has accused the U.S. of violating international law with its attacks on alleged drug boats, which have now killed at least 115 people, and he suggested that some innocent civilians may have been killed in the strikes. The U.S. denies that any innocent civilians have been killed in any of the boat strikes.",
      "Petro \u2014 who once belonged to a guerilla group \u2014 warned Mr. Trump against taking action in his country, writing on X that he \"swore never to touch a weapon again,\" but \"for the homeland I would take up arms that I don't want.\"",
      "Canada",
      "While Mr. Trump has in the past talked about making Canada the \"51st state,\" he has not brought it up again since the Venezuela operation.",
      "But Mr. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs against Canada, raising the tariffs to 35% in August, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "In October, Mr. Trump threatened to end trade negotiations with Canada after an anti-tariff ad using Ronald Reagan's voice ran in Ontario. Ontario Premier Doug Ford pulled the ad, saying \"our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"",
      "Panama Canal",
      "Mr. Trump argued earlier in his term that the U.S. should regain control over the strategic Panama Canal \u2014 drawing flak from Panama's government. The U.S. oversaw the canal's construction in the early 20th century and controlled it for decades, but began handing the canal and surrounding land back over to Panama in 1979.",
      "He claimed in March that he was \"reclaiming the Panama Canal,\" referring to a deal by a U.S.-led consortium to buy a controlling stake in the company that operates ports near the canal. Panama's president accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "What is the Monroe Doctrine?",
      "In 1823, America's fifth president, James Monroe, outlined before Congress the U.S.' policy toward its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. It was initially intended to ward off European colonialism, but the Monroe administration also wanted to increase the U.S.' influence and trading alliances.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. cited the Monroe Doctrine to be used as a defense against the expansion of communism in Latin America.",
      "The phrase \"Don-roe Doctrine\" first appeared on the cover of the New York Post last year.",

      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",

Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them. The United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally and through the defense agreement between the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States of 1951,\" the U.S. allies said.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",
      "On Monday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance.",
      "\"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told local media on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO, and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday if the U.S. would use military force to take over Greenland, Miller told CNN: \"The United States should have Greenland as part of the United States. There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking, of a military operation. Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers pushed back against the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steny H. Hoyer and Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who co-chair the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Denmark Caucus, said in a joint statement that \"sabre-rattling about annexing Greenland is needlessly dangerous.\"",
      "They said any U.S. attack on Greenland \"would tragically be an attack on NATO.\"",
      "\"We already have access to everything we could need from Greenland,\" the two lawmakers said, noting that Denmark's government has already given the U.S. permission to deploy additional military forces there, or to build more missile defense infrastructure on the island.",

    "summary": "The U.S. striking Venezuela and capturing its leader has practical implications for China, Russia, Iran and Cuba, and it also sends messages to each nation.",
    "story": [
      "The United States' biggest strategic adversaries quickly condemned President Trump's decision to order U.S. strikes on Venezuela and the raid to capture now-former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. China, Russia and Iran all called it a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty and international law. Cuba, just south of the U.S. and a close ally of Caracas, also condemned the attack as President Trump predicted his decisions could lead to the collapse of the government in Havana.",
      "As all of those countries had maintained close economic and political ties with the Maduro regime, the dramatic, unilateral U.S. action is likely to have some impact on them, and while that impact may not be tremendous financially in all cases, the message sent by Mr. Trump could be just as important.",
      "\"What I think is clear is that we're entering a new phase of great power competition,\" Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas Program and head of the Future of Venezuela Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News. \"Some of the rules, some of the unthinkables, some of the things that we wouldn't have previously imagined being part of the operation are now on the table as options.\"",
      "A test of China's foothold in the Americas as it threatens Taiwan",
      "China, which buys most of Venezuela's oil, said it was \"deeply shocked\" by the weekend strikes and removal of Maduro, and the foreign ministry in Beijing said the U.S. had \"clearly violated international law\" with its actions.",
      "\"We have never believed that any country can act as the world's police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world's judge,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday, citing \"sudden developments in Venezuela\" without explicitly mentioning the U.S.",
      "\"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law,\" he said, speaking for the first time since Maduro's capture by U.S. special forces.",
      "China's official foreign policy is broadly based on a position of neutrality when it comes to foreign conflicts, and despite Beijing's continuing economic support for Venezuela and unwavering political ties amid the standoff between Caracas and Washington, some analysts say China is unlikely to intervene directly.",
      "\"There isn't much in the way of material support that China can offer Venezuela at this time, but rhetorically, Beijing will be very important when it leads the effort at the U.N. and with other developing countries to rally opinion against the U.S.,\" Eric Olander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project, told the Reuters news agency. \"What we've seen in the cases of Zimbabwe and Iran, both sanctioned by the West, is that China demonstrates its commitment to these relationships through trade and investment, even under difficult circumstances.\"",
      "But that economic bond was likely far more vital to the geopolitically isolated Maduro regime than it was to China.",
      "China's purchases have amounted to a whopping 80% of Venezuela's total, relatively paltry petroleum exports, which Reuters said amounted to less than a million barrels per day during 2025 (compared to about 3 million barrels per day 25 years ago). According to Reuters, Venezuelan exports amounted to only about 4% of the oil China has purchased in recent years.",
      "But Berg said even if President Trump does get U.S. oil firms to move in and start rebuilding Venezuela's decrepit infrastructure to boost production, there are still financial implications for Beijing.",
      "\"The big question that remains unknown at this point is whether all of that production, and especially any increase in production in Venezuela that might occur, is going to come to the United States, or whether it will be sold on international markets,\" Berg told CBS News. \"Remember, Venezuela was sending about 80% of its oil to China. Much of that was to service debt. If China all of a sudden doesn't get that 80% of Venezuela's exports, it is not only losing energy security, but also in a situation where Venezuela is now no longer repaying its debts.\"",
      "\"There's a huge risk here for China that some of its energy security is in fact redirected away from China and toward the United States or toward other markets because of this play in Venezuela,\" Berg said. \"China has a way to make up for what Venezuela represented, but it is not going to be easy, especially as the United States is simultaneously squeezing Iran, one of its other top sources of oil.\"",
      "On the non-economic front, there's also concern that Chinese President Xi Jinping could use Trump's move as justification to launch his own unilateral military action, with an invasion of Taiwan, the U.S.-backed democratic island just off mainland China's coast.",
      "Taiwan punches well above its weight economically thanks to close ties with the West and as the world's most important producer of advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence and weapons.",
      "Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has reiterated his policy of unifying China with Taiwan, and he has never ruled out the use of force to do so.",
      "Russia condemns \"destabilizing\" action, 4 years into its invasion of Ukraine",
      "In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin had still issued no public comment on the American attack on Venezuela by Tuesday, but former President Dmitry Medvedev, who often telegraphs the Kremlin's talking points, said Washington's actions were both \"illegal\" and \"destabilizing.\"",
      "Medvedev also said, however, that the moves ordered by Mr. Trump were in defense of U.S. national interests, given Venezuela's vast proven oil reserves.",
      "\"It must be acknowledged that, despite the obvious unlawfulness of Trump's behavior, one cannot deny a certain consistency in his actions,\" Medvedev said, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency. \"He and his team defend their country's national interests quite harshly.\"",
      "Berg said the U.S. operation in Venezuela supports a philosophy held by Russia's government, which launched the ongoing war in Ukraine with its full-scale invasion of the resource-rich eastern part of the neighboring country nearly four years ago.",
      "\"The Russians have for a long time thought of themselves as a great power, and in their opinion, great powers get exclusive spheres of influence to behave how they wish. I think it guides much of their behavior in Eurasia, and certainly in Ukraine. And I think they think the same way about the United States,\" Berg said.",
      "Berg said Russia uses its relationships in what it perceives as the spheres of influence of other great powers to show its strength.",
      "\"Every time they are ready to pursue aggression in the European theater, it's almost like clockwork, they have a trip of a significant political official to Latin America and the Caribbean,\" Berg said.",
      "Russia did this ahead of its invasion of Georgia in 2008, for instance, when then-President Dmitry Medvedev visited Venezuela and Russia carried out joint naval exercises with Venezuelan forces. It was the first major Russian fleet deployment to the region since the end of the Cold War.",
      "As Russian forces seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014, meanwhile, Putin visited Brazil and met with Maduro and other Latin American leaders. Then, in a visit that ended less than a week before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov visited Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.",
      "These were all \"significant diplomatic visits to Latin America that were meant to show visibility to the United States, and they presaged aggression in the European theater,\" Berg said.",
      "Iran grappling with protests under a threat from Trump",
      "Iranian government forces have been trying to quell protests against the country's rulers for 10 days \u2014 the most significant unrest to sweep the nation since 2022. So far, at least 29 protesters have been killed amid clashes with security personnel, the U.S.-based Human Rights News Agency group said Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week that if Iran, \"violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" warning that his administration was \"locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that Iran would \"not yield to the enemy,\" and reiterated a common claim that the U.S. and Israel were behind the anti-government unrest.",
      "But for some Iranians, desperate to see the end of more than four decades of rule by hardline Islamic clerics, the U.S. action against Venezuela has fueled hope that Mr. Trump might wield similar pressure tactics against their own authoritarian leadership.",
      "\"I think many Iranian people will be inspired by that (message), have been inspired by that,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the Iranian news site IranWire, told CBS News on Saturday. \"The message has made the Iranian regime more careful about its actions and using violence against people.\"",
      "\"I don't think (the protests) are going to lead to the toppling of the regime, because there is no alternative in sight,\" Bahari said. \"But there will be some change in the actions of the regime, change in the decisions of the regime, especially after President Trump's message.\"",
      "The protests across Iran were echoed in London over the weekend, where one demonstrator who said she would like to see the country's former Western-backed monarchy restored told CBS News she hoped Mr. Trump's action in Venezuela would send a signal to Tehran.",
      "\"What's happening in Venezuela is a kind of warning for the Islamic Republic. That's the message from America or Israel: 'That will happen to you, Khamenei.' That's the message,\" said the protester, who gave only her first name, Ghazal.",
      "When asked if she believed the people braving Iran's security forces to protest might also be looking at Venezuela and hoping for similar action in their own nation, Ghazal reiterated her optimism.",
      "\"Definitely something will change, and the Islamic Republic will fall down very soon,\" she said.",
      "Trump says \"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall\"",
      "A day after the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Mr. Trump predicted to journalists on Air Force One that Cuba's 67-year-old communist government could soon collapse as a result of the operation.",
      "\"Cuba looks like it is ready to fall,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"I don't know if they're going to hold out, but Cuba now has no income. They got all their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"",
      "\"What President Trump was referring to is actually internal regime collapse,\" Berg said, stressing that Cuba is \"going through one of the worst moments that it's had since the 1990s,\" when the Soviet Union dissolved, taking its support for the Caribbean island nation with it.",
      "\"I imagine that one of the demands of the new government in Venezuela would be to cut off the shipments of barrels of oil to Cuba, some of which is used to satisfy the domestic demand within Cuba, but also a lot of it sent onwards and sold to other markets for profit,\" Berg told CBS News. \"If that support dries up, Cuba will be in an even tougher position.\"",
      "Maduro was an important economic and political partner to Cuba, and the government in Havana said 32 Cuban nationals were killed in the U.S. operation in Venezuela \u2014 security forces who were there serving at Venezuela's request.",
      "\"For that sister nation and for her people, we are ready to give, as for Cuba, from our own blood,\" the Cuban government said in a statement Saturday, condemning the U.S. operation. Cuba's government called on the international community to condemn the U.S. actions and impose consequences.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed new details Monday about the U.S. operation to capture and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, describing a meticulously planned raid that caught the Venezuelan leader completely off guard.",
      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",
      "\"We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again, not to get it right, but to ensure that we cannot get it wrong,\" Caine said.",
      "CIA personnel inside Venezuela had been tracking Maduro's movements since August, including through an agent who penetrated his inner circle and provided key intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, a massive U.S. military presence remains positioned off Venezuela's coast. American forces are planning to intercept another sanctioned oil tanker they've been pursuing for months, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.",

      "Cher is opening up about how her late ex-husband Sonny Bono controlled her during their marriage and musical partnership.",
      "On Monday's episode of \"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\" the 79-year-old singer reflected on her turbulent personal and professional relationship with Bono, with whom she rose to fame in the 1960s as the pop duo Sonny & Cher.",
      "In 1962, the former couple first met in Los Angeles when Cher was 16 and Bono was a 27-year-old aspiring music producer. Bono, who was working with record producer Phil Spector at the time, became Cher\u2019s mentor, manager and creative partner. The two formed Sonny & Cher in 1964 and they tied the knot during an unofficial wedding ceremony in Tijuana, Mexico, later that year.",

      "\"We had a lot of fun, and he was special in a way, and then it became very treacherous,\" Cher recalled.",
      "Cher opened up about her troubled marriage to the late Sonny Bono. (Jeff Hochberg/Getty Images)",
      "In 1965, Sonny & Cher made their breakthrough with the success of their song \"I Got You, Babe,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The duo, who officially married in 1969, went on to release scores of other hits with Bono handling songwriting, production and business, while Cher was the breakout star and the duo's main draw.",
      "Their success later expanded into television when they launched the variety show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" which made them household names in the early 1970s.",
      "While appearing on \"Armchair Expert,\" Cher explained that her relationship with Bono began to unravel at the height of their fame as he began to increasingly control her day-to-day decisions.",
      "The former couple formed the iconic musical duo \"Sonny & Cher.\" (Harry Langdon/Getty Images)",
      "\"This is when now this kind of new side of Sonny comes out,\" Shepard said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Cher agreed with a nod.",
      "\"Which is like incredibly controlling,\" Shepard continued. \"You have this huge success. There's a lot of money. You're not allowed to leave the house. You're allowed to go shopping. That's pretty much all you're allowed to do, right?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Cher said.",
      "\"And he's cutting you off from friendships you have,\" Shepard said. \"Was it happening slowly? Was it more like you woke up one day and were like, 'Oh, I don't have a life' or while it was happening, were you like, 'What's going on?'\"",
      "\"It took a little while,\" Cher admitted. \"I couldn't do anything.\"",
      "Cher recounted how she began learning to play tennis and would practice at a friend's house. The \"Believe\" hitmaker recalled a harrowing incident that occurred after Bono discovered that she had been seen at her friend's home during a party after playing tennis.",
      "\"I'm leaving, but she's having a huge party. So there are people coming in,\" she recalled. \"And so Dennis, my friend, told Sonny that I was there, but lots of people were there and lots of men were there.\"",

      "Cher described Bono's controlling behavior and recalled that he once burned her clothes in the yard during a fit of rage.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Cher explained that her realization of how Bono was exerting excessive power over her life \"came on kind of slowly.\" The Grammy Award winner said that part of her difficulty with fully grasping the situation stemmed from the difference between how Bono treated her on the set of \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" and his behavior at home.",
      "\"I was free on the show, and he was funny, and we got along,\" Cher remembered. \"It's such a strange dichotomy because we would be laughing, and we'd be having the best time and then when we were at home, it was kind of more cut and dried.\"",

      "Cher recalled that she also discovered that Bono was cheating on her during the rocky later years of their marriage. After Shepard remarked that Bono had \"lots of other girlfriends,\" Cher told him, \"I didn't know except the one.\"",
      "Shepard cited an incident that Cher wrote about in her 1998 memoir \"The First Time,\" in which she went to get a glass of water in the middle of the night and found another woman \"putting her boots on\" in the home the singer shared with Bono.",
      "Cher told Shepard that she had no thoughts of leaving Bono at the time despite the shocking incident. She explained that she stayed in the relationship largely due to \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\" However, she clarified that her reluctance to leave wasn't because she was driven to preserve the show's massive success.",
      "\"It wasn't that, because I was so happy with the show. And he was so nice on the show. And so, at the show we would be having the best time, and we were more working than we were at home,\" she said. \"It was such a polar opposite, because on stage we had a blast. He let me have all the freedom that I wanted to, and then we came home.\"",
      "\"The show kept us together a lot longer than we would have been anyway, because we had such a good time,\" she continued. \"He was so fun, and he was so funny, and we worked so well together.\"",
      "The two found success with their show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\"\u00a0 (CBS)",

      "\"0% for Cher?\" Shepard's co-host Monica Padman asked in disbelief.",
      "\"0%,\" Shepard said.",

      "\"Yeah, what are you going to do \u2014 read 20 pages of legalese?\" Shepard said.",
      "\"And the next day, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of this,'\" Cher recalled of Geffen. \"So I went to Sonny and I said, 'I'll stay with you if we're partners. And he said no.'\"",

      "\"I\u2019ve spent years being cautious, private, and quiet about something that has been shaping my life and my work,\" Bailey began. \"That time is over.\"",

      "\"Out of career caution, diagnostic uncertainty, and being private about such things in general, I have been hiding my battle with this disease for over five years,\" he wrote. \"Time to stop.\"",
      "\"CMS is a genetic disease that disrupts the communication between the brain and the muscle at the \u2018nerve/muscle junction\u2019\u2026 or whatever doctors call it,\" Bailey explained. \"There are billions of these junction dodads in a body, and an increasing number of mine seem to be on the blink. Troublesome, little buggers \u2014 right?\"",
      "\"The point is: my muscles aren\u2019t clearly receiving all my brain\u2019s orders to do all the swell things muscles are meant to do,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s a drag.\"",
      "\"The result being that my hands, arms and legs tire quicker than they should, which makes them weaker than, well \u2026 anticipated,\" Bailey added. \"Sustained repetitive movements are particularly difficult and can cause my muscles to temporarily tighten and shut down.\"",

      "According to the Mayo Clinic, symptoms of CMS often begin at birth or early childhood, but mild forms may be diagnosed later. CMS is a lifelong condition and currently has no cure, though medications can help manage symptoms.",

      "\"Professionally, this is changing me as an actor,\" he wrote. \"Much like walking my dog around the block, or helping at the store, I can still perform on my feet, limitedly.\"",
      "\"I can ambulate my way through simple \u2018walks and talks\u2019 with no problem,\" Bailey continued. \"I can still rise to my feet to object to the judge, derail a town meeting, or yell at a cop for being a loose cannon.\"",

      "The prescription opioid pill, called naltrexone, was first approved by the FDA to treat opioid dependence in 1984. A decade later, it was approved for alcohol use disorder. (iStock)",
      "\"Naltrexone can be used to assist with reducing alcohol cravings and reduce the pleasurable effects from alcohol ingestion, which can help those prone to binge-drinking to consume less volume,\" Dr. David Campbell, clinical director and program director at Recover Together, a behavioral health and addiction treatment facility in Bend, Oregon, told Fox News Digital.",
      "HIGHER STROKE RISK LINKED TO CONSUMING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL, STUDY FINDS",
      "The medication is useful for people who experience strong cravings, often drink to excess once they start, or drink primarily due to reward or relief as opposed to habit, according to Campbell.",
      "\"Naltrexone affects the rewards center of the brain, which blocks the rewarding effects of alcohol.\"",
      "Jessica Steinman, chief clinical officer at No Matter What Recovery in Los Angeles, calls naltrexone \"an incredibly helpful and life-saving tool\" for people who struggle with alcohol use disorder.",
      "\"Currently, in our society, many people are looking to get medication-assisted help from overconsumption of certain things or behaviors, including food, cigarettes and now alcohol,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND FENTANYL VACCINE TARGETS OVERDOSES BEFORE THEY START",
      "\"Naltrexone affects the rewards center of the brain, which blocks the rewarding effects of alcohol and cravings to be minimized. It can assist in telling the brain that alcohol isn't wanted.\"",
      "The drug can also help if someone has a \"healthy\" relationship with alcohol and is looking to cut back on their drinking behaviors, Steinman added.",
      "\"We do not suggest moderation in any way for people struggling with alcohol use disorder or any type of dependence to alcohol or other substances,\" she noted. \"We do not believe drinking \u2018less\u2019 is a solution.\"",
      "Side effects",
      "Common side effects of naltrexone can include nausea and vomiting, headache, sleep disturbances, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, loss of appetite, and joint or muscle pain, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).",
      "These effects are generally mild and may improve as the body adjusts to the medication.",
      "The medication is useful for people who experience strong cravings, often drink to excess once they start, or drink primarily due to reward or relief as opposed to habit. (iStock)",
      "In rare cases, patients may experience more severe effects, such as liver issues, allergic reactions, trouble breathing and mental health effects.",
      "\"The most important thing when taking naltrexone for alcohol use is to ensure that there is no concurrent use of opioids, as taking naltrexone when using opioids can induce precipitated withdrawal, a very uncomfortable event,\" Campbell cautioned.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on how a biotech company plans to test its vaccine that could protect people from fentanyl's lethal effects on 'Special Report.'",
      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",
      "If approved, it would become the first treatment to prevent overdoses of fentanyl, which is the leading cause of drug overdose deaths, statistics show.",
      "DEADLY DRUG MIX DRIVES STAGGERING RISE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AMONG SENIORS",
      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",
      "How it works",
      "The vaccine is designed to create antibodies against fentanyl, which keeps the drug from crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier.",
      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, the fentanyl would be eliminated from the body.",
      "MAJOR CANNABIS STUDY FINDS LITTLE PROOF FOR POPULAR MEDICAL CLAIMS, FLAGS BIG DANGERS",
      "In the mice and rat studies, the animals still had antibodies against fentanyl six months after vaccination, added Haile, who is also a research associate professor of psychology at UH and a founding member of the UH Drug Discovery Institute.",
      "While some have questioned whether such a vaccine would indirectly encourage drug use, Haile pointed out that, for vaccinated people, the drug would have \"no euphoric effects.\" So, those seeking a \"high\" would not get it.",
      "Fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana. (iStock)",
      "The main benefit, according to Haile, is that the vaccine would reduce the potential health dangers of fentanyl.",
      "\"Respiratory depression is the primary effect that induces death from this highly potent synthetic opioid,\" he said.",
      "Headed for trials",
      "Following successful testing in mice and rats, the first human clinical trial is slated to begin in early 2026 at the Center for Human Drug Research, which is associated with the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.",
      "\"They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",
      "The small Phase 1 trial will enroll about 40 participants, focusing on safety and immune response.",
      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "\"Also, unlike other vaccines, we use extremely low doses of the components,\" he noted. \"We have put the vaccine into a lot of animals and have not seen any adverse side effects at all.\"",
      "Even in a toxicology study, during which the researchers administered 20 times the dose of the vaccine that would be given to humans, they still saw no overt signs of toxicity, according to Haile.",
      "Potential use cases",
      "Haile mentioned several different use cases for the vaccine, primarily those with opioid use disorder who want to quit using fentanyl.",
      "It could also be used by first responders and healthcare workers who want to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Military and national security personnel could also benefit from the vaccine, Haile said, as it could help protect against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds that have been used as chemical threats.",
      "Finally, parents may be seeking protection for at-risk teens or young adults, as fentanyl has been known to be mixed with other substances, such as marijuana.",
      "The progress of the vaccine is a \"very exciting advance with a huge upside,\" a medical expert said. (iStock)",
      "Looking ahead, Haile said this could pave the way for the approval of other anti-drug vaccines, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, which are already in the works.",
      "\"If we can tackle the primary ones \u2014 fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine \u2014 we will be saving hundreds of thousands of lives,\" he added.",

      "\"Maryland's chief elections official failed to provide complete\u00a0answers, leaving serious concerns unresolved \u2014 chiefly whether Ian Roberts ever received a live ballot and whether the State has implemented new protocols to verify citizenship after this bombshell report,\" Republican Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil exclusively told Fox News Digital Wednesday.",
      "\"This case underscores the urgent need for stronger citizenship verification requirements when registering to vote \u2014 which was reaffirmed by President Trump just yesterday in his meeting with House lawmakers,\" he continued. \"The Committee's\u00a0investigation will continue.\"",
      "Steil is the chair of the House Committee on House Administration. He and Vice Chair Laurel Lee, R-Fla., sent a letter to Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis in December 2025, demanding answers regarding illegal immigrant Ian Andre Roberts' registration to vote in the state despite not holding U.S. citizenship. Roberts is originally from Guyana with ties to the U.S. going back to the 1990s.",

If yes, what election(s) did he participate in?;\" \"Was Mr. Roberts ever mailed an absentee ballot? If yes, for which election(s)?\" and \"How does the State Board of Elections fulfill their obligations under 52 U.S.C. \u00a720507 to conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from the rolls?\"",
      "Fox News Digital exclusively obtained DeMarinis' response letter to the House Committee on House Administration, which defended the state\u2019s voter registration system but stopped short of confirming whether Roberts, an illegal immigrant later arrested by ICE, was ever mailed an absentee ballot or remains registered to vote.",

      "TRUMP ADMIN MOVES TO SLASH SUGAR IN AMERICAN DIETS",
      "\"Faulty dietary guidelines of the past stack the deck against healthy eating and food options for everyday American families, which has fueled the chronic disease epidemic and jacked up the health care costs of households across the country,\" Leavitt added. \"When these guidelines are followed, Americans will be saving themselves thousands of dollars. If we want to cut health care costs in our country, we must become a healthier country... A healthier America will lead to a more affordable America.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the new guidelines with an updated, inverted food pyramid. The top of the pyramid, which is now the wider part of the structure, is built on meat, fats, fruits and vegetables, while whole grains are at the narrow bottom.",

The secretary has argued that the nation's food practices have harmed Americans and led to skyrocketing healthcare costs.",
      "\"The new guidelines recognize that whole, nutrient-dense food is the most effective path to better health and lower health care costs,\" Kennedy said. \"Protein and healthy fats are essential, and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines. We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"",
      "The HHS secretary railed against refined carbohydrates, food additives and added sugar, highlighting the health risks associated with sugar-sweetened beverages. Kennedy's main message to Americans was to \"eat real food.\"",

This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,\" Makary said. \"This is not a willpower problem for our nation's kids. This is something adults have done to kids, and we're going to fix it.\"",

      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",

      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",
      "FAKE WINDOWS UPDATE PUSHES MALWARE IN NEW CLICKFIX ATTACK",
      "Following the on-screen instructions can quietly trigger malware that steals passwords and personal data. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Ways to stay safe from fake error malware",
      "A few smart habits can significantly reduce risk when facing fake error pop-ups and browser-based traps.",
      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",
      "Real browser and operating system updates come from built-in update tools, not pop-ups on websites. If an update is needed, your device will notify you directly through system settings or trusted app stores.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help block malicious scripts, detect infostealers and stop suspicious behavior before damage spreads. This is especially important since fake error malware targets Windows, Android, macOS and Linux systems.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Stolen credentials fuel the spread of fake error malware. Removing personal information from data broker sites can reduce the impact if login details are compromised and limit how far an attack can spread.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Claims about missing fonts or outdated browsers are a hallmark of these attacks. Modern systems manage fonts automatically, and browsers update themselves. A webpage has no reason to request manual fixes.",
      "If a real update is needed, the operating system will request it directly. A random webpage never should.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",

      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",

      "Chrome extensions are supposed to make your browser more useful, but they've quietly become one of the easiest ways for attackers to spy on what you do online. Security researchers recently uncovered two Chrome extensions that have been doing exactly that for years.",
      "These extensions looked like harmless proxy tools, but behind the scenes, they were hijacking traffic and stealing sensitive data from users who trusted them. What makes this case worse is where these extensions were found. Both were listed on Chrome's official extension marketplace.",

      "Security researchers uncovered malicious Chrome extensions that quietly routed users\u2019 web traffic through attacker-controlled servers to steal sensitive data. (Gokhan Balci/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "Malicious Chrome extensions hiding in plain sight",
      "Researchers at Socket discovered two Chrome extensions using the same name, \"Phantom Shuttle,\" that were posing as tools for proxy routing and network speed testing (via Bleeping Computer). According to the researchers, the extensions have been active since at least 2017.",
      "Both extensions were published under the same developer name and marketed toward foreign trade workers who need to test internet connectivity from different regions. They were sold as subscription-based tools, with prices ranging from roughly $1.40 to $13.60.",
      "At a glance, everything looked normal. The descriptions matched the functionality. The pricing seemed reasonable. The problem was what the extensions were doing after installation.",
      "How Phantom Shuttle steals your data",
      "Socket researchers say Phantom Shuttle routes all your web traffic through proxy servers controlled by the attacker. Those proxies use hardcoded credentials embedded directly into the extension's code. To avoid detection, the malicious logic is hidden inside what appears to be a legitimate jQuery library.",
      "The attackers didn't just leave credentials sitting in plain text. The extensions hide them using a custom character-index encoding scheme. Once active, the extension listens to web traffic and intercepts HTTP authentication challenges on any site you visit.",
      "To make sure traffic always flows through their infrastructure, the extensions dynamically reconfigure Chrome's proxy settings using an auto-configuration script. This forces your browser to route requests exactly where the attacker wants them.",
      "In its default \"smarty\" mode, Phantom Shuttle routes traffic from more than 170 high-value domains through its proxy network. That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",
      "While acting as a man-in-the-middle, the extension can capture anything you submit through web forms. That includes usernames, passwords, card details, personal information, session cookies from HTTP headers and API tokens pulled directly from network requests.",
      "CyberGuy contacted Google about the extensions, and a spokesperson confirmed that both have been removed from the Chrome Web Store.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",
      "OPINION: THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN",
      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",
      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Tips for using AI chatbots more safely",
      "Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.",
      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:10:26 -0500",
    "summary": "OpenAI develops automated attacker system to test ChatGPT Atlas browser security against prompt injection threats and cybercriminal risks.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Most robot headlines follow a familiar script: a machine masters one narrow trick in a controlled lab, then comes the bold promise that everything is about to change. I usually tune those stories out. We have heard about robots taking over since science fiction began, yet real-life robots still struggle with basic flexibility. This time felt different.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",
      "More broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.",

When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next. That shift is worth paying attention to.",

      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",

      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 07:02:37 -0500",
    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "STATE-LEVEL AI RULES SURVIVE \u2014 FOR NOW \u2014 AS SENATE SINKS MORATORIUM DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE",
      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning.

It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "In a letter sent to the council following the vote, Nowning called the decision \"astonishing,\" warned it has already damaged public trust, and said the union is formally invoking impact bargaining, arguing the appointment affects officers\u2019 working conditions, safety and confidence in police oversight.",

In a Facebook post, Nordyke said city staff failed to conduct a background check before Hedquist was first appointed to the Community Police Review Board in 2024 and that she did not know his full criminal record at the time.",

      "After hearing concerns from police and fire unions, Nordyke said she realized she should have sought broader input before the vote and has instructed city staff to draft a motion to reconsider and remove Hedquist from public safety boards when the council reconvenes. She also called for improved vetting standards moving forward and defended her long record of supporting police and fire departments through pay increases, staffing expansions and union contracts.",

      "An agent standing near the front of the vehicle appears to draw his firearm and fire three shots at it, the video shows. The vehicle then crashes into a parked car and hits a light pole.",
      "Frey said after the shooting the first priority of local law enforcement was to get the victim to the hospital, and the second was to get ICE off the scene because they were \"making a difficult situation more problematic.\"",
      "\"What they are doing is causing chaos and distrust. They are ripping families apart, sowing chaos in the streets and, in this case, quite literally killing people,\" he said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"",
      "Frey had a message for federal immigration agents in the city.",
      "\"To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis,\" the mayor said. \"We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some sort of safety and you are doing the opposite.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference that the agents' vehicles got stuck in the snow and they were trying to push them out when the woman \"attacked them.\"",
      "\"It was an act of domestic terrorism,\" she said.",

      "That is a significant increase from the roughly 300 arrested by Dec. 12, making it a much larger operation than some of the Border Patrol surge operations in cities such as Charlotte, North Carolina, and New Orleans.",
      "McLaughlin also said Border Patrol agents just arrived in Minneapolis and will begin operations there Wednesday.",
      "DHS this week sent hundreds more officers and agents to bolster immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, with the agency posting on social media that it is waging \u201cthe largest DHS operation ever\u201d in Minnesota.",
      "The immigration enforcement operation will add up to 2,100 officers, according to two senior DHS officials. The administration began swelling the numbers Sunday and planned to continue adding forces Wednesday, the officials said. That total includes 1,500 enforcement and removal officers and 600 Homeland Security Investigations agents.",
      "Arrests in Minneapolis could increase with the added boots on the ground.",

      "A dangerous assignment",
      "\u201cThe problem here is insurgency, terrorism and guerillas,\u201d said Robert Pape, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an expert in security affairs.",
      "\u201cThere is no way you\u2019re going to be able to send in the civilian contractors\u201d who make up the core workforce for international oil operations, he said.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has the jungles of Vietnam and the mountains of Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "In an interview Monday with NBC News, Trump predicted that American companies could get expanded oil operations in Venezuela \u201cup and running\u201d in fewer than 18 months. Most experts put the timeline for expanding operations at a minimum of three to five years.",

      "Questionable returns",
      "Trump\u2019s fixation on Venezuela\u2019s oil and his potential willingness to deploy U.S. forces to secure it underscore how much petroleum remains a key cog in the international system.",
      "As Trump has scaled back on renewable energy investments and advocated a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d movement to double down on oil and gas, the U.S. has leaned even harder into global petro-politics.",
      "Yet, even beyond the immediate danger to employees that going into Venezuela would present for U.S. oil companies, experts said, the economic incentives that a company would typically need in order to justify such a risk-laden investment are absent here.",
      "Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips have already lost billions of dollars worth of equipment and technology seized by the Venezuelan government in 2007.",
      "That year, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez decreed that foreign oil companies could own no more than a 40% stake in any oil project in the country, with the rest held by a state-run oil company.",
      "The only major U.S. firm to accept the terms was Chevron, which remains in Venezuela to this day.",
      "Exxon and ConocoPhillips are still trying to recover some of the money they lost.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Top Republicans on Capitol Hill, including leaders of the House and the Senate, are pushing back against President Donald Trump on Greenland, saying it would be inappropriate for the United States to use military force to take over the Arctic island.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday night he did not think it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d for the U.S. to use military action to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory controlled by Denmark, a founding member of NATO.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Johnson told reporters he did not think \u201canybody\u2019s seriously considering that.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., also rejected the idea, telling reporters Tuesday he does not see \u201cmilitary action being an option\" in Greenland. \u201cThat, to me, is that\u2019s not something that anybody is contemplating seriously at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "But Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement clarifying the president's position: Trump believes that acquiring Greenland is a \u201cnational security priority\u201d and that using the military is \"always an option at the Commander in Chief\u2019s disposal,\" she said.",
      "Trump's words are being closely monitored on Capitol Hill and in capitals around the world after he ordered military strikes on Venezuela and the successful capture of its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, last weekend. On Wednesday, the U.S. seized two sanctioned tankers, including a Russian-flagged oil tanker that was in the Atlantic.",
      "After Maduro's capture, Trump reiterated his desire to see the U.S. take over Greenland, which he and his team see as strategically important militarily and containing vast mineral wealth. On Monday, Trump told NBC News that he is \u201cvery serious\u201d about acquiring the territory.",
      "The prime ministers of Greenland and Denmark have pushed back aggressively, while other U.S. allies in Europe have stood by the island and emphasized its sovereignty.",
      "After briefing lawmakers in the Capitol on Wednesday morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that he will be meeting next week with Danish officials, who have requested a meeting.",
      "Rubio said it's been Trump's \"intent from the very beginning\" to buy Greenland.",
      "Some key Republicans on the Hill are sticking with Trump. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., a Trump ally and Afghanistan war veteran, said using the military is always an option for the U.S.",
      "\"You\u2019re never going to have the administration say that there\u2019s some option off the table because we\u2019re the United States of America. We don\u2019t limit ourselves,\" Mast said.",
      "But other powerful Republicans are alarmed by Trump's saber-rattling directed at Greenland.",
      "\"I am not for the United States taking over Greenland either by military means or financial incentives,\" said Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine.",
      "\u201cI hate the rhetoric around either acquiring Greenland by purchase or by force,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. \"And you know I don\u2019t use the hate very often, but I think that it is very, very unsettling and certainly concerning as one whose actually been in Greenland, who has friends in Greenland. I\u2019m a co-chair of the Arctic Parliamentarian Conference, and my chair is from Greenland. We\u2019ve worked together for years.\u201d",
      "Even some loyal Trump allies are flummoxed by the president\u2019s posture toward Greenland.",
      "\u201cDenmark\u2019s a great ally,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., adding that he hasn\u2019t spoken with Trump about it. \u201cYou\u2019d have to call Trump and ask him what he\u2019s doing.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the former Republican leader and outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance, also pushed back on the threats, without naming Trump.",
      "\u201cThreats and intimidation by U.S. officials over American ownership of Greenland are as unseemly as they are counterproductive,\" he said in a statement. \"And the use of force to seize the sovereign democratic territory of one of America\u2019s most loyal and capable allies would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm to America and its global influence.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he\u2019s hearing from NATO allies who are \u201cdeeply disappointed in the president\u201d and \u201cwondering whether Congress can stand firmly for NATO.\u201d",
      "He said to expect the Senate to offer and force a vote on a war powers resolution prohibiting Trump from unilaterally engaging in any \u201cmilitary action within or against Denmark or Greenland.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat will come up for a vote sometime, and hopefully it\u2019ll be a resounding vote,\u201d said Kaine, who sits on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. \u201cRepublicans are not happy with this continued rhetoric. Now, whether they would have the backbone to vote on a war powers resolution, who knows? But they\u2019ll likely have that opportunity.\u201d",
      "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., sought to nudge the administration toward a diplomatic resolution, saying Wednesday that he \"met with the Ambassador of Denmark and the Head of Greenland Representation to discuss the longstanding ties between our nations and the NATO alliance.\"",
      "\"The people of Denmark and Greenland are ready and willing to continue our partnership in the Arctic to counter growing Russian and Chinese threats,\" Flood said. \"After meeting with their representatives, I am confident that Secretary of State Marco Rubio can navigate a diplomatic win-win solution with one of our finest allies.\"",
      "Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee who has spent time in Greenland, told NBC News that he's confident there will be no military action in Greenland and that this is a negotiating tactic by Trump to boost the U.S. military presence on the island.",
      "\"This is a way to really alert, not awaken, but alert people to the threat that's coming from the Arctic,\" he said, \"and the way to do that is to enhance the defense of Greenland.\"",
      "Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the lead Democrat for the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said his phone has been blowing up with text messages from NATO partners \"about this Greenland situation.\"",
      "\"They are taking this incredibly seriously and are deeply alarmed,\" Boyle said. \"We're living in the world that we built out of the ashes of World War II. And if the U.S. were to attack Greenland, it would be the end of NATO, and it'd be the end of this post-war world that we've built. So the consequences are far greater than the small population of Greenland. And do I think this president is aware of any of that? Absolutely not.\"",
      "Still, Boyle voiced pessimism that Congress would act to stop Trump: \"Under this weak Republican leadership that always bends to Donald Trump's will, I don't have any confidence.\"",
      "He added that if Democrats take control of the House next year, they'd have more tools to stop him, like the power of the purse."

      "The U.S. administration\u2019s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to open that country\u2019s oil reserves to major energy companies has sparked a resurgence of pro-colonialist sentiment among some prominent figures inside the White House and the broader MAGA political movement.",
      "\u201cNot long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful),\u201d White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, one of the aides Trump has tasked with overseeing the Venezuelan government, wrote on X the day after American forces raided Maduro\u2019s compound and brought him to the U.S. for trial on a series of charges.",
      "\u201cThe West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cThe neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.\u201d",
      "The ode to colonialism, delivered by an aide who has been described as Trump\u2019s id, comes as Venezuela\u2019s stability is in question and Trump has cast his eyes on Colombia, Cuba and Greenland \u2014 two independent nations and one large territory that has long belonged to Denmark.",
      "Miller\u2019s take is at odds with most mainstream scholarship on the topic of colonialism, not to mention the ethos of political self-determination and economic independence that fueled the American revolution. In the journal Philosophy and Public Affairs, University of Arizona professors Ritwik Agrawal and Allen Buchanan wrote in February that the \u201cfundamental wrong\u201d at the heart of the \u201cimmorality of colonialism\u201d is \u201ccolonizers regarded the colonized as incapable of managing their own affairs, in effect relegating them to the status of minors or mentally incompetent adults.\u201d",
      "That view of colonizers, they argued, laid the foundation for political and economic dominance, and for the \u201cinequalities of power that persist today and that continue to contribute to economic injustices and to the failure to regard the weaker as equals.\u201d",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "So far, the vision Trump has laid out for Venezuela \u2014 America exercising control over the country\u2019s government from afar while rebuilding its oil infrastructure \u2014 hews closer to imperialism than colonialism. The latter would involve sending settlers to Venezuela to fundamentally alter its politics, its institutions and its culture.",
      "\u201cImperialism is simply when country A externally controls country B or territory B,\u201d said Bruce Gilley, a professor of Politics and Global Affairs at Portland State University who wrote the book \u201cThe Case for Colonialism,\u201d based on a controversial article he authored. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t imply anything about what you do there. Indeed it implies a kind of hands-off attitude.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the raid and subsequent declaration of American authority over Venezuela, some in the MAGA movement have begun to publicly embrace a form of interventionism \u2014 colonialism \u2014 that once seemed at 180-degree odds with an ethos of deep antipathy for foreign wars and aid.",
      "\u201cColonization is one of the greatest things that ever happened to the backwards parts of the world, and the only reason most don\u2019t know this is because they were educated by communists who hate Western civilization,\u201d Jesse Kelly, a right-wing broadcaster, wrote on X on Jan. 4.",
      "Elon Musk, a close ally of the president, retweeted a lengthy X post from conservative commentator Lauren Chen that stopped short of endorsing colonialism but argued for a reinterpretation of its effects on countries subjected to it.",
      "\u201cPeople often say that the developing world is poor because the Western world colonized them and stole their resources. The truth, however, is that over the past century, the developing world has, for the most part, shown that they are completely incapable of harnessing their own resources,\u201d Chen wrote, pointing to Venezuela as an example. \u201cThey are poor because they do not know how to run and administer their own countries, resources be damned.\u201d",
      "Toward the end of her post, Chen added, \u201cNow, none of this is to say that colonialism is good. ... However, the idea that colonialism and resources extraction are responsible for the developing world\u2019s ongoing poverty? That is quite simply a crock of s---.\u201d",
      "And MAGA influencer Matt Walsh, without using the terms \u201ccolonialism\u201d or \u201cimperialism,\u201d argued that the U.S. should seize power in foreign countries to extract natural resources.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, the \u2018war\u2019 lasted like 90 minutes,\u201d he wrote in a post to his 4 million X followers. \u201cSecond, going to war to secure vital resources for your own people is totally legitimate. Why should we allow some third world communist s---hole to control trillions of dollars worth of oil?\u201d",
      "A White House press aide did not respond to a request to make Miller available for an interview, but he described the U.S.'s relationship with Venezuela in decidedly imperial terms during an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper this week.",
      "\u201cBy definition, we are in charge because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission. So the United States is in charge. The United States is running the country during this transition period.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have questioned whether a long-term engagement in Venezuela fits with the \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra Trump campaigned on, particularly at a time when many Americans say they are struggling to make ends meet at home.",
      "\u201cWake up MAGA. VENEZUELA is not about drugs; it\u2019s about OIL and REGIME CHANGE,\u201d Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent Trump critic, wrote on X on Jan. 4. \u201cThis is not what we voted for.\u201d",
      "But Trump insisted in the interview with NBC News that his MAGA base will stick with him.",
      "\u201cMAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\u201d",
      "For the time being, U.S. officials say, they are working with former Vice President Delcy Rodriguez \u2014 a onetime Maduro ally who has been sworn into Venezuela\u2019s presidency \u2014 to administer the country. Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Monday that Rodriguez has been cooperating with the U.S. and talking to Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly.",
      "There\u2019s a long history of American presidents backing Latin American leaders \u2014 or seeking to remove them \u2014 based on their willingness to bend to U.S. will, said Duke University history professor John D. French, who has studied Latin American politics for more than four decades.",
      "\u201cTrump is completely consistent with American policymaking, which is that countries have interests, they don\u2019t have friends,\u201d French said, noting that the U.S. will not perceive colonialism as in its interests.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. never intended to annex Iraq or annex Afghanistan \u2026 because we don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want to do is put people in power who we believe will serve our interests.\u201d",
      "For now, that means working through Rodriguez as U.S. officials figure out what can and cannot be accomplished through her.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not rushing into it, and that\u2019s OK for now,\u201d Gilley, the Portland State professor, said. \u201cThe United States has enormous leverage in this situation.\u201d"

      "The viral post, first published Friday, has elicited strong denials from major delivery apps that have been the subjects of past scrutiny for exploitive worker policies. It accrued more than 87,000 upvotes on Reddit and millions of impressions across other social media platforms where screenshots have circulated, before being removed by Reddit moderators Tuesday evening.",
      "Behind the scenes, as reporters tried to substantiate the claims, the ruse continued \u2014 still with AI.",
      "On Reddit, comments responding to the post generally accepted the claims as true.",
      "\u201cAs a human I think companies that try to charge different humans different amounts for the same things should no longer be allowed to operate,\u201d said one response, which received more than 1,800 upvotes.",

      "The anonymous user first posted to the r/confession subcommunity last week, claiming they were exposing their company\u2019s secrets despite \u201ca massive NDA,\u201d or non-disclosure agreement, because they \u201ccan\u2019t sleep at night knowing I helped build this machine.\u201d",

The algorithm, the Reddit user claimed, would save the higher-paying orders for casual drivers to entice them to use the app.",

The image of the badge sent to them appeared to be an almost exact copy of the photo the poster had received from NBC News, but the badge included altered details, such as an Uber Eats logo on a background matching the company\u2019s colors.",
      "The Verge and Platformer, which both reported having been given the fake badge photo, ran it through Google\u2019s Gemini and found a SynthID watermark identifying it as having been either generated or edited by Google AI.",

      "Platformer founder Casey Newton told NBC News that the Reddit user gave him an 18-page document that they claimed were internal Uber documents. It included charts, diagrams and mathematical formulas, which almost fooled him. But then, Newton said, he noticed peculiarities in the formatting, the language and even the way it single-handedly backed up all of the poster\u2019s various allegations.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of a cartoon villain\u2019s document about how you would exploit a human being to the absolute maximum,\u201d Newton said. Soon, he said, the red flags pointed to the entire Reddit post\u2019s being a sham.",
      "To Newton, the saga was a reminder of how, in the age of increasingly sophisticated and accessible generative AI, anyone online can easily and quickly fool even the most discerning content consumers.",
      "Whether it\u2019s an employee ID that once took skilled Photoshop work or a bulky technical document that would have taken hours or days to falsify, much of the visual evidence that once could be easily believed must now be subject to more scrutiny.",
      "\u201cIt is really unfortunate that this post got millions of views, and I think there\u2019s some chance that millions of people now believe that there is a delivery company that is doing all of these things,\u201d Newton said.",
      "People are especially vulnerable to believing and resharing content that elicits emotional reactions like outrage, he said. And there is also the power of confirmation bias.",
      "Food or grocery delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart have faced accusations of exploitation in past years, when it was revealed that they used tips to subsidize part of their workers\u2019 base pay.",
      "Similarly, ride-share services like Uber and Lyft have faced multiple lawsuits for classifying drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, allowing the companies to avoid providing minimum wage, overtime pay and other benefits.

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:57:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Stranger Things fans are convinced that the show didn't end. All about the Conformity Gate theory",
    "story": [
      "A group of \"Stranger Things\" fans are not ready for the story to be over.",
      "The viral theory dubbed Conformity Gate on social media proposes there is still one more episode left of the blockbuster Netflix hit beyond the two-hour series finale that was released on New Year's Eve.",
      "Fans believe that the real final episode will be released by Netflix on Jan. 7 to wrap up the story that ended in Episode 8 of Season 5, titled \"The Rightside Up.\" They think there is an Episode 9 that ends the series with a different storyline.",
      "Here's what to know about the online theories.",
      "What Is Conformity Gate?",
      "Warning: This section contains spoilers to the final season of \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "The epilogue to Episode 8 of the final season shows the long-time group of friends in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, graduate from high school and play a game of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" together like they did in the show's first season.",
      "Each character is then shown enjoying a happy ending to their individual story, from the romance between Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) continuing to Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) thriving in college to Will (Noah Schnapp) living with a boyfriend in New York.",
      "Fans labeled the ending \"Conformity Gate\" because it represented  a frictionless, conformist ending rather than embracing the show's themes of breaking with the norm and defying external expectations.",
      "Why Do 'Stranger Things' Fans Believe There is Another Episode?",
      "Fans have gone down the rabbit hole with lengthy TikTok explainers and videos of scenes from the show's five seasons edited together to back up their theories.",
      "A theme behind the theories is that the happy endings for everyone were all an illusion created by the monstrous Vecna, the show's main villain. A humanoid that first appeared in Season 4, Vecna was originally human Henry Creel (Jamie Campbell Bower), who was sent to an alternate dimension by the powers of Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and became a monster.",
      "Fans have pointed out that all the students portrayed in the Hawkins graduation scene are sitting with their hands folded. They have likened the pose to one Creel once made before he became Vecna, as well as the character Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) when he was controlled by Vecna in Season 4.",
      "The ambiguous ending for Eleven, one of the show's primary characters, has also left fans divided over whether she died or not after defeating Vecna. Sink, who plays Max, has a clear position on it.",
      "Another image pushed by fans is that the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" binders owned by the main characters line up on a shelf to read \"X A LIE,\" which they think means that Vecna being beaten in Dimension X was a lie. However, on the show, it looks more like \"X AILE,\" which has no meaning.",
      "The speculation over the episode being released on Jan. 7 comes from multiple sources.",
      "Netflix released a cryptic teaser on Christmas saying \"Your Future is on its way\" with the date of Jan. 7, 2026, leading \"Stranger Things\" fans to thinking something big was coming even though it's not indicated in the video.",
      "The number seven also has meaning on \"Stranger Things\" because a die with the number seven facing up can be seen at the end of final episode to the right of a \"Stranger Things\" player manual. Noah Schnapp's character also rolls a seven while playing \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in the show's first episode in the first season.",
      "Is There Another Episode Coming?",
      "Netflix has seemingly made it clear that the show is over with the bio on its Instagram and X accounts for \"Stranger Things.\"",
      "\"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING,\" the bio reads.",
      "Schnapp, who plays Will Byers, also spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the end of the show.",
      "\"I remember crying a lot at the final table read,\" he said. \"They had us read it for the first time all together and I just think it was perfect. They really left nothing more to be told.\"",
      "\"Once I wrapped, I felt it was time to let Will go,\" he continued. \"Now I\u2019ve really made peace with it, and especially sharing these final episodes with the fans, the fact that these stories have been told and the journeys are done. Even though the story is over, I\u2019ll take with me the lessons I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m going to take the relationships with me forever, and I just hope this show can have a lasting, positive impact.\u201d",
      "For the final season, the streaming giant released the first four episodes on Thanksgiving, the next three on Christmas, and the final installment on New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "However, there is more coming out about Season Five. Netflix released a trailer on Jan. 5 for a documentary called \"One Last Adventure\" that will give a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the final season. The documentary starts streaming on Jan. 12.",
      "Twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, who created \"Stranger Things\" in 2016, were asked by the UK site Capital Buzz on Jan. 5 about theories that there is one more episode or an alternate ending that they shot and did not release.",
      "\u201cOh no,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cI love when I hear people do that, but I\u2019m like, \u2018How do you have the time?\u2019 Oh my God! The energy to A, write it, and then shoot it. Are you crazy? No. No.\u201d",
      "While there is no indication of any secret episodes of \"Stranger Things,\" the Duffer brothers teased a spin-off of the show in a Jan. 1 interview with Variety. Matt Duffer said they will introduce \"completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.\u201d",
      "There also is a \"Stranger Things\" animated spin-off called \"Tales From '85\" set to come out in 2026."

Will you add some dimensions to this character?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re done.\u2019\u201d",
      "For his work on \u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d Bird would go on to win the Oscar for best animated feature film of the year. He also directed the film\u2019s sequel, \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d as well as \u201cRatatouille,\u201d which also earned him another Oscar in the same category.",

      "Harrison added that when President Donald Trump signed into law last summer funding rescinded by Congress, CPB\u2019s board \u201cfaced a profound responsibility: CPB\u2019s final act would be to protect the integrity of the public media system and the democratic values by dissolving, rather than allowing the organization to remain defunded and vulnerable to additional attacks.\u201d",

    "summary": "What happened to Eleven in the Stranger Things finale? Here's what happens to Eleven and what the Duffer Brothers said about her fate.",
    "story": [
      "\"Stranger Things\" has concluded its nine-year run, ending its fifth and final season with a single episode out on the last day of 2025.",
      "Fans had a major reaction to the finale, which saw the defeat of the show's big bad, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) and launched our troop of Hawkins, Indiana teenagers into their futures.",
      "A redditor said they cried \"for an hour\" after the finale. Another called it an \"11/10 finale.\"",
      "A fan on Threads likened the finale to the feeling of becoming an adult: \"Perfect. No notes. For me, that\u2019s exactly what it felt like to grow up. Leaving a sacred portal in time before you\u2019re ready.\"",
      "But what exactly happens, and where does it leave Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)? Here's what to know about the ambiguous ending.",
      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",
      "The episode's title, \"The Rightside Up,\" indicates what happens in the finale: Things are put, well, right, and that involves the closing of the Upside Down, the portal that opened in Season 1.",
      "Eleven and Will (Noah Schnapp) defeat Vecna. But there's more that needs to be done: The Upside Down itself needs to be destroyed.",
      "Eleven seems to understand her role in the next phase of the plan, but others in her life are resistant. \"I have to end the cycle,\" Eleven tells Hopper (David Harbour), her adoptive father.",
      "He's skeptical, delivering a speech about her deserving a better life. \"Life has been so unfair to you. So cruel. But you never let it break you. I need you to fight, kid,\" Hopper says.",
      "But Eleven decides to make her own choice. After Hopper creates a bomb to destroy the Upside Down, Eleven stands in the portal's doorway and refuses to budge.",
      "She visits her boyfriend, Mike (Finn Wolfhard), psychically before it detonates. \"None of this will ever end if I'm still here,\" she says. She continues later, \"I need you to help them understand my choice.\"",
      "She leaves one last message: \"I will always be with you. I love you.\"",
      "After one last kiss in the psychic-verse, the gang looks on as Eleven sacrifices herself to the bomb that closes the Upside Down.",
      "Wait, But Does Eleven Really Die?",
      "Depends on who you ask.",
      "After the sequence, the episode cuts to the future. It's the day of high school graduation and Mike confesses to Hopper he's \"not OK\" with the idea of moving on from Eleven.",
      "So does he create a story that helps him cope with his new reality, or has he really picked up on an alternate explanation of Eleven's fate?",
      "At the end of the episode, the gang is back playing Dungeons and Dragons. Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next. The show then cuts to their futures, indicating that Mike got it right with his predictions.",
      "\"But there is a story he can never tell,\" Mike says. The story of the mage \u2014 Eleven's character As for the real story?",
      "According to Mike, Eleven and her sister, Kali, devised a plan to help her escape at the very last minute. \"She had to make everyone, including her friends, believe she was dead,\" Mike says.",
      "Kali cast an invisibility spell on Eleven, then an illusion spell making it seem like she had been swept up by the bomb. \"No one will ever know\" where Eleven went, Mike says, but \"I like to imagine she's in a beautiful land.\"",
      "The show cuts to Eleven walking through a landscape and finding a small town to live in. \"It is here, at last, that she finds peace,\" he says.",
      "Will asks, \"How do we know it's true?\"",
      "Mike responds, \"We don't. Not for sure. But I choose to believe that it is.\"",
      "\"Stranger Things\" fans have the same choice.",
      "What the Duffer Brothers Said About the Finale and Eleven's Fate",
      "\"There was never a version of the story where Eleven was hanging out with the gang at the end,\" Ross Duffer told Netflix's press site Tudum.",
      "Ross Duffer said Eleven's death, or disappearance, was integral to the story ending. Eleven represents childhood \u2014 and the finale is all about the kids of \u201cStranger Things\u201d growing up.",
      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",
      "There was no way Eleven was going to carry out Hopper\u2019s dream of her becoming a \u201cregular\u201d girl, essentially.",
      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "The operation to seize the sanctioned vessel, which changed its name from the Bella 1 to the Marinera after fleeing the American blockade of Venezuela last month, was carried out early Wednesday. The U.S. also announced the seizure of another sanctioned tanker, the M/T Sophia, which it said was \u201cconducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin, a strong supporter of deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accused the U.S. of violating maritime law by seizing the Marinera.",
      "The ship's efforts to evade authorities were followed in real time by a fleet of observers and analysts, who also tracked as the U.S. moved military assets to the United Kingdom in recent days.",
      "The saga emerged as a new flashpoint between Washington and Moscow that threatened to undermine the Trump administration\u2019s blockade of the Latin American country in the wake of its stunning attack and capture of Maduro.",
      "The U.S. European Command confirmed the seizure of the Marinera for violating U.S. sanctions. \u201cThe vessel was seized in the North Atlantic pursuant to a warrant issued by a U.S. federal court after being tracked by USCGC Munro,\u201d it said in a post on X.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill that the tankers were seized as part of \"stabilization\" efforts for Venezuela.",
      "He said that the interim authorities in Venezuela \"understand the only way they can move oil, generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, announced on X that the U.S. had also apprehended M/T Sophia, \u201ca stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker\u201d that it said was \u201coperating in international waters and conducting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea.\u201d",
      "Emmanuel Belostrino, an oil market analyst at Kpler, said satellite imagery and port reports indicate the Sophia was \u201claden with around 2 million barrels of Merey crude oil, loaded from Jose Oil Terminal (JOT)\u201d in Venezuela. Kpler, which runs the ship-tracking service MarineTraffic, said the Sophia's involvement in sanctioned trade may extend back several years.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the operations \u201ctwo safe, effective boardings within hours of each other.\u201d Noem said that the Bella 1 had been trying to evade the Coast Guard for weeks, \u201ceven changing its flag and painting a new name on the hull while being pursued, in a desperate and failed attempt to escape justice.\u201d The \u201cheroic\u201d crew of USCGC Munro, she added, pursued the vessel \u201cacross the high seas and through treacherous storms.\u201d",
      "The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade of sanctioned oil shipments to and from the country. The Marinera was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would hand over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., as its vast reserves emerged as a key pillar of his plans \u2014 and a point of tension with Russia and China.",
      "NBC News reported last month that the Marinera, then known as the Bella 1, had been on the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024.",
      "It was pursued by the U.S. Coast Guard off Venezuela last month, and as of Jan. 5 it was off the west coast of Scotland in the North Atlantic, according to data from the ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.",
      "Russia's Transport Ministry said in a statement following the tanker's capture that the Marinera had been granted temporary authorization to sail under the Russian flag in late December, and that it had lost all communication with the ship after U.S. forces boarded it on Wednesday.",
      "\"The high seas are governed by the principle of freedom of navigation, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered under the jurisdiction of other states,\" it said.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry told state news agency Tass it was closely monitoring the situation and demanded the humane treatment and \"prompt return\" of Russian citizens onboard.",
      "Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs Leonid Slutsky told Tass the seizure was \"unquestionably a violation of maritime law and UN conventions,\" while Senator Andrei Klishas, of the Putin-aligned United Russia party, said on Telegram that the U.S. had \u201cturned to outright piracy on the high seas.\u201d",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing that the Marinera was \"deemed stateless\" after \"flying a false flag.\" She said the crew would be subject to prosecution under U.S. federal law and \"will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"",
      "Pressed on whether the seizure would inflame tensions with Russia, Leavitt said Trump had an \"open, honest and good\" relationship with Vladimir Putin, but said Trump would \"enforce our policy that's best for the United States of America, and with respect to these ship seizures, that means enforcing the embargo against all dark fleet vessels.\"",

Two C-130J Hercules tactical transport aircraft and three U-28A Draco special operations aircraft were also recorded flying in the area.",

      "But the seized tankers are not the only ones threatening to undermine the U.S. blockade.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have changed their flags to Russia, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. The ships \u2014 the Malak, now renamed the Sintez; the Dianchi, now the Expander; and the Veronica, now the Galileo \u2014 had previously been sailing under the flags of Comoros and Guyana, according to MarineTraffic."

      "HAVANA \u2014 The ripple effects from the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday could make their way quickly here, devastating this island that has been in a yearslong economic crisis.",
      "Following the dramatic operation that ousted Maduro in the dead of night, President Donald Trump suggested Cuba\u2019s government will fall, something reiterated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.",
      "Since the rise of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999, Cuba has depended heavily on Venezuela for subsidized oil in exchange for Cuban medical professionals, military advisers, security forces and others. Without Venezuelan oil, Cuba\u2019s economy, which is already in a deep crisis, will likely spiral even further.",
      "\u201cIf oil supply were to cease entirely, the Cuban economy would grind to a halt,\u201d said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Javeriana University in Colombia. \u201cThis would represent a devastating blow to a Cuban economy already in recession for six years and lacking the productive capacity, competitiveness and foreign currency to replace these flows.\u201d",
      "Expecting more hardship",
      "In Cuba, where everyday people are accustomed to the dire economic situation, many are bracing themselves for even tougher conditions following the U.S. actions in Venezuela. The island and its government survived the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s when its economy shrank by roughly 30%.",
      "\u201cThe situation here is going to become very difficult,\u201d said Rey Rodriguez, a butcher. \u201cImagine what awaits us. Less oil, more blackouts \u2026 young people are going to become even more pessimistic.\u201d",
      "There are no oil tankers leaving Venezuela for Cuba based on satellite tracking services, according to Jorge Pi\u00f1\u00f3n, an energy expert at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. It doesn\u2019t mean \u201cghost ships\u201d with their transponders turned off haven\u2019t slipped in.",
      "Venezuela usually sends three or four tankers per month, which adds up to 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the Venezuelan supply is so important, because those 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day represent 50% of the deficit that Cuba has of oil,\u201d Pi\u00f1\u00f3n said. The rest is supplied by Mexico and Russia.",
      "Weeks before the U.S. actions in Venezuela, Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel gave a bleak outlook of the economy during a speech at the National Assembly, saying the country\u2019s gross domestic product decreased over 4%, inflation shot up and the economy was \u201cpartially paralyzed.\u201d",

But I don\u2019t think there can be a change of government, because the problems have been around since 1962, and this government is prepared for these types of situations.\u201d",
      "Cubans, under U.S. sanctions for decades, have been dealing with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel for the past few years, as the import-dependent island has seen its foreign currency revenues fall by about 30%.",
      "Its tourism sector, the second most important source of revenue for the government, has taken a hit in recent years and could drop even further if conditions on the island worsen.",
      "Cuba is also grappling with a trifecta of mosquito-borne illnesses including dengue and chikungunya virus that have affected almost one-third of the population. The situation has worsened with the government\u2019s inability to clear piles of trash that accumulate on streets and to carry out fumigation campaigns.",
      "For the past year, Cubans have faced prolonged blackouts because of the island\u2019s aging oil-fired power plants. Cuba\u2019s grid collapsed several times last year because of the outdated infrastructure and fuel shortages. Declining oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico have led to the rationing of electricity. The capital, Havana, once insulated from blackouts, now faces 10 hours or more without electricity each day. In other parts of the country, the blackouts can extend to 20 hours.",
      "Oil shipments from Venezuela are likely to stop if Trump gets his way.",
      "Cuba\u2019s second biggest supplier of oil, Mexico, is also facing pressure from Trump. He recently suggested the U.S. can take action against the country, saying drugs were \u201cpouring\u201d through Mexico and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to do something.\u201d",
      "A defiant government response",
      "The day Maduro was captured, Cuba\u2019s president condemned and denounced the U.S. actions in a defiant speech. D\u00edaz-Canel said that U.S. actions were not about Maduro, his government or even drug trafficking, but that the \u201cobscure object of imperialist desire was Venezuelan petroleum, the lands and natural resources of Venezuela.\u201d",
      "D\u00edaz-Canel also said that \u201cfor Venezuela, and of course also for Cuba, we are willing to give our own blood, even our own lives, at a very high price.\u201d",
      "Cuba\u2019s government said 32 of its military and security personnel were killed Saturday.",
      "Cuba\u2019s state-run media, including television and the official newspaper Granma, published pictures of the 32 officers killed, along with their names, ages and ranks.",
      "In an interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, declined to say what kind of further actions the U.S. could take against Cuba.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Cuba is already under heavy U.S. sanctions, but there are still other actions the U.S. can take. During Trump\u2019s first administration, the U.S. banned all flights to Cuba except for Havana.",
      "In Havana, former senior Cuban diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told NBC News, \u201cWe need to see what repercussions this will have. But the world hasn\u2019t ended as it seemed, and as Marco Rubio and Donald Trump would like to portray it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe they are using intimidation to see if they can affect relations between Venezuela and Cuba, which I would say are not currently affected because Cuba and most Cubans support Venezuela in condemning the U.S. aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "Alzugaray added that Cuba\u2019s government should be in the midst of intense conversations and consultations with its allies, like China and Russia.",
      "Cuba, with a Soviet-style command economy, has been unwilling to loosen restrictions on the private sector and open its economy to foreign investment, as many allies like Vietnam and China have urged it to do.",
      "Vidal, the economist, said that when the USSR collapsed, it took the Cuban economy four years to hit rock bottom and begin to recover. Tourism, remittances and foreign investment helped rescue the economy from collapse in those years, something that hasn\u2019t happened this time around.",
      "\u201cToday, there is widespread distrust among the Cuban government\u2019s own international allies regarding the viability of its economic model and its finances,\u201d Vidal said. \u201cIn the 1990s, there was a stronger and more respected political leadership, both nationally and internationally, which is not the case now.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump gave the Venezuelan leader one last chance to step down.",
      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "As he turned to go back inside, he told NBC News at the scene Friday, \u201chell\u201d erupted as a deadly fire broke out. \u201cI heard a big boom, and everybody was screaming,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",

      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",

      "Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",

      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

      "There will also be major governor\u2019s races in key swing states like Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin; legislative races that could determine control of legislatures across the country; and mayoral races in cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C."

      "Protesters in Iran defied authorities Tuesday, hitting the streets in the capital, Tehran, and smaller cities to chant anti-government slogans amid an ongoing violent crackdown that one human rights group says has left at least 36 dead.",
      "The protests began last week with economic grievances as the Iranian currency, the rial, tanked. They quickly turned political, with demonstrators chanting slogans against the ruling clergy.",
      "The rial dropped to a record low of 1.46 million against the dollar Tuesday. If it continues to drop, it is unlikely that the protests will stop anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "HRANA, a network of rights activists, noted in a report Tuesday that 36 people have been killed since the demonstrations began 10 days ago \u2014 34 protesters and two members of the security forces \u2014 and that more than 2,000 people have been arrested.",
      "Dramatic videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show security forces firing tear gas at Tehran\u2019s main bazaar Tuesday as protesters scramble for cover into passageways and narrow streets. Gunshots can be heard in some videos, and protesters can also be heard chanting slogans directly against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic.",
      "Unrest at the Tehran bazaar is particularly unsettling for officials because the shuttering of shops at the ancient marketplace and protests from the merchant class were key elements that led to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.",
      "Another video shows a person using a makeshift flamethrower on security forces in the southern city of Shiraz.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as a relative moderate, in the past week called for protesters' demands to be heard and said he was asking the interior minister to meet with the leaders of the protest movement.",
      "But the head of Iran's judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, warned Wednesday that there would be \u201cno leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic.\u201d Accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country, Ejei was quoted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency as saying there was \u201cno excuse for those coming to the streets for riots and unrest.\u201d",
      "But the demonstrations are diffuse and largely leaderless, and Pezeshkian\u2019s efforts at mediation \u2014 and the killings and arrests by security forces \u2014 have not persuaded the protesters to stay off the streets.",
      "\u201cThe system has responded to these protests with a combination of conciliatory rhetoric and brute force,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cThe fact that neither has worked indicates that the former falls well short of what the protesters want, and the latter has failed to deter them from expressing it.\u201d",
      "Protesters got an unexpected offer of support last week when President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. would intervene if violence against protesters continued, though he did not specify what actions the U.S. might take.",
      "Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said Friday on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "Analysts say Trump\u2019s message fed into the conspiracy theories of the most hard-line elements of the government, who were already on high alert for any foreign interference after a devastating 12-day war with Israel last summer, partly joined by the U.S. military, which left the country reeling.",
      "The detention of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a staunch Tehran ally, over the weekend only highlighted the issue for Iranian officials.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the operation to detain Maduro \"a clear example of state terrorism\" in a telephone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Saturday, according to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry\u2019s official website.",
      "\u201cWhat the threshold for U.S. intervention would be, or what it might look like, is not entirely clear but the leadership in Tehran is likely worried about the prospect of dealing with not just instability from below but military action from abroad,\u201d Vaez said.",
      "Some of the worst violence in recent days took place in the small town of Malekshahi and nearby Ilam in western Iran. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported that security forces opened fire on a crowd Saturday, killing five people and wounding more than 40 others.",
      "In a video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, a crowd disperses quickly as multiple gunshots ring out and a handful of men return to pick up a man bleeding from a head wound.",
      "The wounded and dead from Saturday's violence in Malekshahi were taken to the Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam, where security forces stormed the compound and used batons, tear gas and live fire, according to Hengaw. A video posted on the organization\u2019s site, which was verified by NBC News, shows a member of the security forces shooting into the hospital courtyard where people were gathered behind a gate.",
      "The U.S. State Department's Farsi language account on X posted a video of the security forces rushing into the Ilam hospital compound below text that read, \"Hospitals are not battlefields.\" The post also called the raid \"a crime.\"",
      "On Monday, Pezeshkian issued an order for the interior minister to investigate the unrest in Ilam province, according to the semi-official Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency.",
      "Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank in London, said the use of the security forces, the slowing down of the internet and the violence in smaller towns were part of a \u201ccrackdown playbook\u201d used by the government to deal with protests.",
      "\u201cThis is, of course, all part of a more organized effort, after a few lenient first days, to get people off of the streets as soon as possible,\u201d she said."

      "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Days after Venezuela\u2019s capital was rocked by explosions and the country\u2019s leader was seized in a U.S. operation, the streets of this city were eerily quiet.",
      "Few people are venturing from their homes, although businesses have begun to reopen and the long lines that had snaked outside the few pharmacies and supermarkets that were operational over the weekend are disappearing. Those trying to get to work using the public bus system seem to be struggling as it seems to be on a skeleton schedule.",
      "The more than half a dozen people who spoke to NBC News said that there has been an increased presence of government security forces as well as armed civilian paramilitaries loyal to the government. Officials have called for the arrest of anyone involved in the weekend\u2019s attack. For those who quietly oppose the Maduro government, they hope they\u2019re finally seeing the end of a dark period of their history. For those who supported him, there\u2019s the uncertainty of what will happen to their leader.",
      "Daniel, a gardener who commutes from his home on the outskirts of Caracas to the upscale neighborhood of Altamira, said he stayed home on Monday because he was afraid of encountering pro-government groups that are widely reported to be checking people\u2019s cellphones. Like everyone interviewed for this story, Daniel asked not to be fully identified out of fear of reprisal from authorities that are very much still in power.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Daniel said he was hopeful that sooner or later Venezuelans would have a country where they could express themselves freely and choose their own leaders.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t deny that the future makes me anxious, but I do trust that change can happen from now on,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "After an extraordinary weekend \u2014 when the country\u2019s authoritarian leader and his wife, Nicolas Maduro and Cilia Flores, were seized by U.S. special forces and American bombs rained down on military facilities, ports and power installations \u2014 the regime appears to be holding firm. President Donald Trump has made clear as of now that he supports the leadership of Maduro\u2019s vice president and successor, Delcy Rodriguez, who has said she is willing to work with the United States.",
      "Still, intractable issues remain. The government continues to be willing to use intimidation and violence to remain in power and shows few signs of trying to fix an economy that has trapped 90% of the population in poverty despite the country\u2019s vast oil wealth. Hundreds of people are still in prison after they were arrested during protests following the July 2024 election, where there was credible evidence Maduro\u2019s opposition won.",
      "On Sunday morning, Josefina and her husband, both 70-year-old retirees, were driving along Boyac\u00e1 Avenue, a highway that carves an east-to-west path across Caracas alongside Waraira Repano National Park. The road is popular on weekends when families take in the views of nature surrounding the city.",
      "What was supposed to have been a relaxing weekend outing turned nerve-wracking when the couple encountered a checkpoint. At first they thought it was \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the Venezuelan government. Instead, a black van carrying the insignia of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence, which is responsible for stopping espionage and intelligence threats, was parked behind the men.",
      "\u201cThey were dressed in civilian clothes and were heavily armed,\u201d Josefina said.",
      "Josefina and her husband got home fine since they likely are not seen as a threat to a government that is on highest alert. But on Monday, near the National Assembly around the time Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president, 14 journalists and press workers were detained. \u200bThirteen journalists have been released and one was deported, according to a local journalists\u2019 group.",
      "Some residents said they were afraid of the possibility of another U.S. attack.",
      "Rosa, a 47-year-old optometrist who lives and works in eastern Caracas, said that while she was happy about Maduro\u2019s capture, she would never forget the terror she experienced early Saturday.",
      "\u201cI would never want to live through something like that again in my life,\u201d she said, describing how at 2 a.m. an explosion woke her up. \u201cThe windows of my house shook as if there were an earthquake. It was so strong that my neighbor\u2019s windows cracked.\u201d",
      "Germari, 26, a graduate in foreign trade who lives near one of the military bases attacked on Saturday, echoed that sentiment.",
      "\u201cMy mother, my sister, and I have been sleeping together since that day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t rested because even the sound of cars frightens us. My biggest worry is that it will happen again.\u201d",

      "The U.S. attack against Venezuela and capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 which the United Nations said undermined international law \u2014  has raised fears that this might not be an empty threat.",

      "The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies that \u2014 under NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense \u2014 Trump has suggested attacking.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the allies said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark.",
      "It added that \u201cthe United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally\u201d and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. \u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",

      "\"Denigrating our Allies serves no purpose and there is NO up side,\" he said. \"It weakens us by diminishing trust between friends, and Russia and China love it. So\u2026 stop the stupid 'we want Greenland BS.'\"",
      "One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe\u2019s desire for \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks.",

But Trump has indicated he may instead turn that might against a NATO ally, telling NBC News on Monday that he was \u201cvery serious\u201d in his ambitions to take control of Greenland.",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, took this a step further. He told CNN that \"obviously Greenland should be part of the U.S.\" because of what he described as the island's geostrategic importance in helping Washington fulfill its role as \"the power of NATO.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland?\" he said. \"Nobody is going to fight the United States militarily over Greenland,\" Miller added.",

      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for more than a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",

      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",
      "When asked what Congress \"knew\" \u2014 and whether any lawmakers had advance notification about the operation \u2014 Trump declined to elaborate.",

      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth.

      "Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an \u201cunacceptable line,\u201d warning the attack set an \u201cextremely dangerous precedent for the international community.\u201d Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia\u2019s Gustavo Petro, Mexico\u2019s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile\u2019s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention.",
      "Legal experts also questioned the operation\u2019s legality.",
      "The use of military force to remove Venezuela\u2019s president is effectively a \u201ckidnapping\u201d and violates core principles of the United Nations Charter, said Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.",

      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation \u201ccomplex,\u201d and said his country \u201cwill take our time,\u201d to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that \u201cany solution must respect international law and the U.N.

      "Senior Iranian officials fired back, warning that U.S. intervention would spark regional chaos and make American forces in the Middle East \"legitimate targets.\"",
      "It comes after protests in the Islamic Republic took a sharply violent turn in recent days, with at least seven deaths reported by a human rights organization and at least three reported by a semiofficial news agency.",
      "The protests erupted Sunday in the capital, Tehran, with crowds largely chanting about economic grievances after the country's currency hit a record low against the dollar as prices soar.",
      "People have since taken to the streets in smaller cities, and the protests have taken a more political bent with slogans targeting the clerical regime and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's highest authority.",
      "Iran\u2019s economy has been battered by years of sanctions and a 12-day war with Israel last June \u2014 when the U.S. military also attacked the country\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 added to the sense of popular unease. A water crisis also led to taps running dry at times late last year.",
      "Iran\u2019s civilian government, led by President Masoud Pezeshkian, has been signaling it wants to negotiate with protesters and recognized their \"legitimate demands.\"",
      "But responding to Trump, Khamenei adviser Ali Shamkhani warned that \"Any hand of intervention that comes close to Iran\u2019s security under any pretext will be cut off before it can act.\"",

      "Gunshots can be heard in several videos of protests that have been posted online since Wednesday.

    "summary": "Details are beginning to emerge about the fire that eruopted at the Constellation Bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Day.",
    "story": [
      "It was the moment New Year\u2019s revelry turned into catastrophe.",
      "A photo shows partygoers hoisting wine bottles fitted with sparklers, yet even as they toast the occasion flames are already visible on the foam soundproofing lining the low ceiling of the bar at the upscale Alpine ski resort.",
      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",
      "On Friday, officials set about the painful task of identifying the dozens of charred bodies left by the fire, while emerging images and eyewitnesses gave an indication of the horrific scene that unfolded.",
      "One video \u2014 like that photo, geolocated by NBC News to inside the venue in the early hours of New Year's Day \u2014 suggests that the panic was not immediate. Even as flames licked the rafters and debris began to drip down, some onlookers filmed on their phones while others kept dancing or talking over the music. Another person attempted to beat the flames with a white T-shirt.",
      "Soon, it became clear this was a grave emergency. Another video shows the fire more advanced, the person filming quickly turning to run up the stairs toward the exit, urging others to hurry or get out of the way.",

The nationality is unknown for 14 of those injured.",
      "On Thursday evening, mourners had arranged hundreds of candles at a traffic circle near the venue, which had by this point been covered up in white plastic by authorities. There was an air of somber stillness, with the mostly young crowd sharing hugs, and expressions of shock and disbelief.",
      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin described it Thursday as \u201cone of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced.\u201d",
      "Geneva University Hospitals said it was treating five people. Most patients were young, between 15 and 30 years old, said Dr. Robert Larribau, the chief physician at the hospitals' emergency department.",
      "He told NBC News that many of them had \"serious injuries\" that appeared to have been caused by the twin phenomena of \"backdraft\" and \"flashover.\"",
      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities said they had ruled out terrorism, saying that an explosion at the venue was caused by the fire, rather than the other way round.",
      "They have not commented on the images of bottles fitted with sparklers. Those novelty drinks have appeared in past promotional videos for the bar, served by waiting staff wearing helmets rimmed with neon lights.",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press news agency that he saw these drinks being handed out.",
      "The French and Italian governments have said their citizens are among those missing.",
      "Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who was in Switzerland, said dozens of interviews had been carried out. \u201cUsing fireworks in such a small location doesn\u2019t really seem a very responsible choice,\u201d Tajani said, adding that identifying those responsible would be up to authorities.",
      "And the first victim was named by the Italian Golf Federation on Friday as Emanuele Galeppini, a young Italian golfer \u201cwho embodied passion and authentic values,\u201d the federation said.",
      "The French soccer club FC Metz said one of its youth players, Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, was among those injured and had been airlifted to hospital in Germany.",
      "They had been partying at what Conde Nast Traveler had described as one of Europe's best ski resorts in 2025, calling the town \"particularly chic.\"",
      "With views of the iconic Matterhorn mountain, it attracts both serious skiers and socialites, serving as the home of the late \"James Bond\" actor Roger Moore during his later years before he died in 2017.",
