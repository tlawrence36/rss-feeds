      "Two family films are dominating the holiday box office.",
      "Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d winning the three-day weekend over \u201cMufasa\u201d by a blue hair.",
      "Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while \u201cMufasa\u201d brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

      "Forget your mayo baths, edible Pop-Tarts or even a national championship.",
      "Bowls don't get much better than Snoop Dogg directing the halftime show of the game bearing his name.",

      "Snoop Dogg has seemed to become omnipresent the past few years through a massive entertainment empire.",
      "He's a rapper first, but also a movie and TV actor, video game character, pitchman, record company owner, vintner and Gin & Juice salesman.",
      "Snoop Dogg also has been involved in football for years; as a youth coach, guest analyst, with his own Snoop League for inner city youth in Southern California. He followed Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski into the celebrity bowl sponsorship arena and, true to his brand, created quite a spectacle \u2014 along with NIL opportunities for the players \u2014 at the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop.",
      "Martin's RedHawks beat Colorado State 43-17 in the game, but Snoop Dogg was the main attraction.",

      "Once game day rolled around, it seemed to be all Snoop all the time.",
      "Snoop Dogg caught a few passes from Miami\u2019s equipment manager during warmups and stopped by a tailgate outside for a few sips of gin & juice. He generated a huge roar walking out of the tunnel for the coin toss, decked out in a green-and-gold Arizona Bowl sweatsuit, sunglasses, gray Snoop Dogg sneakers, a black Gin & Juice hat and, of course, a bit of bling draped around his neck.",
      "Snoop Dogg shook hands with captains from both sides, flipped the coin \u2014 with a little flair - and posed for a photo with two of the officials before jogging to Colorado State\u2019s sideline, where he donned a headset to do a little play calling.",
      "Between quarters, Snoop Dogg tried to fire the T-shirt cannon \u2014 the shirts only flew a few feet so he waved it off \u2014 and stopped by to bop his head to a circle of Native American performers before heading up to the booth to join the TV broadcast.",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-day-a-week thing with me, man,\u201d Snoop Dogg said during the broadcast. \u201cI guess I\u2019m the people\u2019s champ because I love the people as much as they love me.\u201d",
      "That's for sure.",
      "Snoop Dogg went back down to the field for the halftime interview with Martin, then climbed the bandstand to lead both schools\u2019 bands, hitting the high notes in a medley of his songs. After stint in a suite, Snoop Dogg was back in the booth for the fourth quarter, a small Snoop Cam in the corner of the screen to catch his reactions during the action.",
      "Snoop saved the best for last.",
      "With Miami's players gathered around a makeshift stage, Snoop Dogg rolled out in a light green, lowrider Chevy Impala with gold rims and accents, the shiny Arizona Bowl trophy in his hand as fans screamed his name. After the ceremony, Snoop Dogg handed out gold chains to the players and took a few pictures before a wave of security helped usher him out of the stadium like the rock star he is.",

      "NEW HOPE, Pa. -- Dayle Haddon, an actor, activist and trailblazing former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d model who pushed back against age discrimination by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "Responders detected a high level of carbon monoxide in the property and township police said Saturday that investigators determined that \u201ca faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system caused the carbon monoxide leak.\u201d Two medics were taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide exposure and a police officer was treated at the scene.",
      "As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994\u2019s \u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d starring John Cusack.",
      "Haddon left modeling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s, but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband's 1991 death. This time she found the modeling industry far less friendly: \u201cThey said to me, \u2018At 38, you\u2019re not viable,\u2019\u201d Haddon told The New York Times in 2003.",
      "Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to aging baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Est\u00e9e Lauder and then L\u2019Oreal, for which she promoted the company's anti-aging products for more than a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Early Show.\u201d",
      "\"I kept modeling, but in a different way,\" she told The Times, \u201cI became a spokesperson for my age.\u201d",
      "In 2008, Haddon founded WomenOne, an organization aimed at advancing educational opportunities for girls and women in marginalized communities, including Rwanda, Haiti and Jordan.'",
      "Haddon was born in Toronto and began modeling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes \u2014 she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, according to her website.",
      "Haddon's daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was \u201ceveryone\u2019s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pure heart. A rich inner life. Touching so many lives. A life well lived. Rest in Light, Mom,\u201d she said."

      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "Longtime CBS sportscaster Greg Gumbel has died from cancer",
      "Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster who broke barriers during his career calling some of the biggest sporting events, has died from cancer, according to a statement from his family released by the network on Friday. He was 78.",
      "\u201cHe leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\u201d wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement.",
      "In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues.",
      "Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties.",
      "In 2001, he announced Super Bowl 35 for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship.",
      "David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as someone who broke barriers and set standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness.",
      "\u201cA tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" Berson said.",
      "Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998.",
      "Sean McManus said of all the moves he made in his nearly 27 1/2 years leading CBS Sports, one of his proudest was bringing Gumbel back.",
      "\u201cNot only did he elevate our NFL and NCAA coverage to a new level, but his kindness, generosity, sense of humor and unselfishness were second to none. When he was around, he made everyone from the researchers to the technicians to the executives feel like he was their best friend,\u201d said McManus, who retired as CBS Sports chairman in April. \u201cHis love for his family was always the foundation of his life. There will never be another Greg Gumbel, and our industry and this world is a sadder place without him.\u201d",
      "Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the world figure skating championships and the following year hosted NBC\u2019s daytime coverage of the Atlanta Summer Olympics.",
      "But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS\u2019 NFL studio show, \u201cThe NFL Today,\u201d from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004-05.",
      "Earlier this year, Gumbel recalled replacing Brent Musburger as host of \u201cThe NFL Today\u201d in 1990, describing it as intimidating and daunting.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I got to sit in the same chair and do the same thing or try to do the same thing that he did was an incredible honor,\" he said.",
      "Gumbel also called NFL games as the network\u2019s lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl 35 and 38. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.",
      "\u201cLike all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\u201d Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \u201cWhat a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\u201d",
      "Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003.",
      "Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn\u2019t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \u201cBy my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\u201d",
      "Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network.",
      "James Brown, who currently hosts \u201cThe NFL Today,\" described Gumbel on Friday as \u201cMr. Versatility and also very telegenic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was my pleasure to call him a friend and one who could do anything that was given to him in the wake of an assignment,\u201d he added.",
      "Gumbel won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting.",
      "Outside of his broadcast career, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital for 16 years.",

      "When Snoop Dogg agreed to become the sponsor of the Arizona Bowl, he had a demand: It must have a NIL component",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg has nearly as many ties to football as he does to rap music.",
      "The entertainer coached youth football for years and created the Snoop League, an after-school program for inner city Los Angeles youths. Snoop has been a guest analyst on football broadcasts and his son, Cordell Broadus, played Division I football.",
      "When Snoop took his latest step, becoming the sponsor of a bowl game, he had a demand: Find a way for all players in the game to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) money.",
      "\u201cThis was Snoop's idea,\u201d said Kym Adair, executive director of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. \u201cHe was having conversations with people he knows in the college football world and I got a call that said he wants us to be the first bowl to make this commitment and that's what we did.\u201d",
      "The beneficiaries are Colorado State and Miami (Ohio), who will conclude their seasons Saturday at Arizona Stadium in the Arizona Bowl. The bowl is classified as a 501(c)(3), so all revenue goes to charity. And, being one of the few bowls not tied to ESPN, it opens the door for unique sponsorship opportunities.",
      "The bowl was previously sponsored by Barstool Sports and the digital media company used its own cast of characters on the broadcast, which was streamed on its digital platforms.",
      "Snoop Dogg takes over this year. The rapper/entertainer is the latest celebrity to sponsor a bowl, following the footsteps of Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski at the LA Bowl.",
      "And, Snoop being Snoop, he wanted to put his own spin on his own bowl.",
      "\u201cCollege football fans are exhausted by the constant talk around NIL, conference realignment, coach movement, transfer portal and super conferences,\u201d Snoop said in a video posted on social media. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we get back to the roots of college football \u2014 when it was focused on the colleges, the players and the competition, the community, the fan experience and the pageantry.\u201d",
      "With that will be an NIL component.",
      "The bowl can't pay players just for playing in the bowl, but both teams participated in football clinics on Friday and will get paid for their services. Other bowls have given single players NIL opportunities, but this is believed to be the first to offer it to every player on both teams.",
      "\u201cI love the fact that the Arizona Bowl is unique and tries new things, and obviously having Snoop here is unique,\u201d Colorado State coach Jay Norvell said. \u201cThe NIL component, it\u2019s the future. It\u2019s what football has become now. We think it\u2019s fantastic for our kids and then the interaction with the kids is the hidden gem of the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The NIL component of the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl comes a month after a similar effort in The Players Era Festival basketball tournament in Las Vegas. The eight-team tournament said it paid out $9 million in NIL money to participating players for activities outside the competition. It also offered $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years for services and activities compliant with NCAA regulations.",
      "Are the Players Era Festival and Arizona Bowl the start of a new future? It is not out of the question in big-time college athletics, where schools are already preparing for the era of revenue sharing with players next year.",
      "\u201cRevenue sharing between the players and the athletic departments is already on the horizon, so whether that takes the place of these types of arrangements or they're completely separate has yet to be determined,\" Adair said. \"We're just trying to be flexible, ahead of the curve and make an impact any way we can.\u201d",
      "Just the way Snoop wants it.",

      "The former Morrison Hotel, made famous by The Doors and their 1970 album of the same name, was significantly damaged by a fire that erupted in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday.",
      "The four-story building, which has been vacant more than a decade, burned for nearly two hours before more than 100 firefighters brought the flames under control, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "The Morrison Hotel was featured on the cover of The Doors' fifth album. Celebrated music photographer Henry Diltz made the image in 1969 and said years later that it took a little trickery to pull it off.",
      "A hotel clerk told the band they weren't allowed to take photos inside, but when the clerk stepped away, the group ran into the lobby and Diltz quickly got the photo looking through the window, with legendary frontman Jim Morrison in the middle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great old wooden building with many small rooms upstairs where transients and drinkers could sleep it off on a cot for $2.50 a night!\" Diltz told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I think the beautiful front window with \u201cMorrison Hotel\u201d in red letters was the best part of it! So did The Doors!\u201d",
      "The album was viewed as a comeback to their roots for The Doors, coming on the heels of Morrison's on-stage arrest at a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity.",
      "Morrison and The Doors would release one final album, \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d before he was found dead in a Paris bathtub on July 3, 1971.",
      "Los Angeles firefighters who first arrived at the blaze on Thursday found heavy flames on the building's top floor.",

      "As season two of Netflix's hit series \u201cSquid Game\u201d returns Thursday, viewers can expect more untimely deaths for many of its characters",
      "Viewers may gasp, cringe or cry out watching characters die on Netflix's \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but those simulated deaths have a different effect on its creator, writer and director. Instead, Hwang Dong-hyuk feels happiness seeing them go.",
      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d season two premieres Thursday. It once again stars Lee Jung-jae and centers around a secret competition in South Korea that targets people in debt and the winner gets a big cash prize. What they don't know is that losing the game is deadly.",
      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",
      "\u201cI never in my wildest dream thought it was going to be this huge,\u201d said Hwang, who spoke with the AP about the show and what comes next. Answers have been edited for clarity and length.",
      "___",
      "HWANG: I learned that I shouldn\u2019t give up. If you love something and if you want to create something, it might not work now, but the time might come later. Or that idea could be the source of inspiration for something else.",
      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",

      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera&rsquo;s first new production of Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aida&rdquo; in 36 years",
    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",
      "A norovirus infection is characterized by sudden vomiting and diarrhea. Outbreaks are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like nursing homes and jails, as well as schools and places where people are close together.",
      "Here are a few things to know about the virus.",
      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",
      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body ache, headache and fever.",
      "Most norovirus outbreaks occur when people who are already infected spread the virus to others by direct means, such as through sharing food or eating utensils. Outbreaks can also be spread through food, water or contaminated surfaces .",
      "Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.",
      "But with 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the United States, norovirus nevertheless causes on average 900 deaths and 109,000 hospitalizations annually, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. It also leads to 465,000 emergency department visits, mostly involving young children.",
      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

      "It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.",
      "The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "Here's a look at data on where things stand:",
      "Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the U.S.",
      "But one thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.",
      "There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.",
      "\u201cAbortion bans don\u2019t actually prevent abortions from happening,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.",
      "But, she said, they do change care.",
      "For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions \u2014 and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.",
      "For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.",
      "As the bans swept in, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.",
      "They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it\u2019s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.",
      "But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions was via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.",
      "This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.",
      "Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.",
      "But a network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortion in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.",
      "Abortion funds, which benefitted from \u201crage giving\u201d in 2022, have helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.",
      "Since the downfall of Roe, the actions of lawmakers and courts have kept shifting where abortion is legal and under what conditions.",
      "Here's where it stands now:",
      "Florida, the nation\u2019s second most-populous state, began enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy on May 1.",
      "That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortion to an exporter of people looking for them.",
      "There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.",
      "While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.",
      "The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.",
      "But some states where abortion remains legal until viability \u2013 generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there\u2019s no fixed time for it \u2013 have seen clinics open and expand.",
      "Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.",
      "There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.",
      "But Myers says some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So they\u2019re now in the count of clinics \u2013 even though they might provide few of them.",
      "How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration says hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration\u2019s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.",
      "More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms and were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.",
      "Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.",
      "\u201cIt is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,\u201d Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.",
      "Since Roe was overturned, there have been 18 reproductive rights-related statewide ballot questions.",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on 14 of them and lost on four.",
      "In the 2024 election, they amended the constitutions in five states to add the right to abortion. Such measures failed in three states: In Florida, where it required 60% support; in Nebraska, which had competing abortion ballot measures; and in South Dakota, where most national abortion rights groups did support the measure.",
      "AP VoteCast data found that more than three-fifths of voters in 2024 supported abortion being legal in all or most cases \u2013 a slight uptick from 2020. The support came even as voters supported Republicans to control the White House and both houses of Congress.",

      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation\u2019s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week.",
      "Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans \u2014 something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm.",
      "Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work.",
      "\u201cIs this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cRight now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn\u2019t open the door.\u201d",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms.",
      "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month.",
      "The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were \u201cconcerning,\u201d but the risk to the general public from the outbreak \u201chas not changed and remains low.\u201d",
      "Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what\u2019s happening with mutations carefully.",
      "\u201cThere will be additional influenza pandemics and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,\" he said. \"We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don\u2019t know what time it is.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sierra Leone's brutal civil war from 1991-2002 created about 28,000 amputees",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass.",
      "\u201cThey forgot I had one leg,\u201d the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: \u201cWe fall and we rise.\u201d",
      "The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels.",
      "But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country.",
      "Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week.",
      "More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets.",
      "\u201cNo one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,\u201d Makieu said.",
      "The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees\u2019 confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They\u2019ve trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work.",
      "The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter.",
      "At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor.",
      "\u201cMany (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don\u2019t believe they have love,\u201d the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war.",
      "First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital.",
      "But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders.",
      "His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don\u2019t fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many.",
      "Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child.",
      "Makieu wants to inspire future farmers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my dream to teach people about life. It\u2019s about changing your mindset,\u201d he said.",
      "Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke.",
      "\u201cWe are created for fellowship, not isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.\u201d",
      "Makieu interjected: \u201cI sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.\u201d",
      "But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support.",
      "Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master\u2019s degree in social work, he cannot find a job.",
      "\u201cEven if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,\u201d Kani said.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination.",
      "Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education.",
      "But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration.",
      "\u201cThe government don\u2019t keep their promises. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Kani said.",
      "There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said.",
      "Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions.",
      "A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand.",
      "Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population.",
      "Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone.",
      "Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer.",
      "\u201cAny successful story, there must be painful experiences,\u201d he said.",

      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\u201d Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cThis cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\u201d",
      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",

      "",
      "Under the settlement, Independent Health will make \"guaranteed payments\" of $34.5 million in installments from 2024 through 2028. Whether it pays the maximum amount in the settlement will depend on the health plan's financial performance.",

      "Michael Ronickher, an attorney for whistleblower Teresa Ross, called the settlement \"historic,\" saying it was the largest payment yet by a health plan based solely on a whistleblower's fraud allegations. It also was one of the first to accuse a data mining firm of helping a health plan overcharge.",
      "",
      "The settlement is the latest in a whirl of whistleblower actions alleging billing fraud by a Medicare Advantage insurer. Medicare Advantage plans are private health plans that cover more than 33 million members, making up over half of all people eligible for Medicare.

      "Additionally, some health plans are capping how much they'll pay for the GLP-1 drugs, if they cover them at all. The Mayo Clinic has capped that lifetime spending at $20,000, Elli said.",
      "",
      "An Uptick Already",
      "",
      "Farah Husain, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix, said her hospital has seen a small uptick in surgical patients from 550 in 2023 to about 580 this year.",
      "",
      "\"I'm seeing patients sometimes with BMIs of 60, 70, 80, and no one has ever mentioned surgery to them before,\" she said. \"The only reason they come in is because they saw something about the medications. These are people who need such a significant amount of weight loss, they need surgery on top of the drugs.\"",
      "",
      "Some private practice surgeons contracted with Kaiser Permanente to perform bariatric surgery for the health plan's enrollees are also reporting a bump in patients in recent months.",
      "",
      "\"The GLPs have thrust a huge new cost on the Kaiser system that is probably unsustainable,\" said Billy, a Kaiser contractor. Lately, he said, \"we're seeing more Kaiser volume than we've ever seen before.\"",
      "",
      "Many clinicians interviewed said that just as cancer treatment often requires a combination of surgery and drugs, combination therapy will be the treatment plan for many patients with obesity. They may take the medications to lower weight to better prepare them for surgery, or after surgery after they reach a plateau.",
      "",
      "A possible offsetting factor is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposal last month that it would pay for the new weight loss drugs in 2026, if the new administration approves.",
      "",
      "Making Adjustments",
      "",
      "The Mayo Clinic has made adjustments to respond to the change in surgical volume, Elli said. \"We have shifted our practice so that we have more non-surgical practitioners to accommodate those patients who don't want surgery.\"",
      "",
      "Nationally, he expects many bariatric surgeons will adjust as well, diversifying their surgical repertoire. \"Surgeons who are only doing bariatric surgery need to reconfigure,\" he said. \"Current bariatric fellowship graduates may find it difficult to obtain a pure bariatric practice and may need to alternate with acute care surgery.\"",
      "",
      "For many bariatric surgeons, the prospect of taking on general surgery  --  where often it's one-and-done  --  goes against the reason they chose weight-loss surgery as a specialty. They wanted longer-term relationships with their patients.",
      "",
      "\"We operate on the patients and ideally follow them for as long as they're willing to come back, to make sure they're maintaining weight loss and healthy habits and help them along the way,\" Husain said. \"The theme in our world is that obesity is a chronic disease.\"",
      "",
      "The Payers Aren't Helping",
      "",
      "Benjamin Clapp, MD, a bariatric surgeon at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso, Texas, chairs the ASMBS task force that tracks bariatric surgical volume every year.",
      "",
      "He said neither the official totals for 2023 nor estimates for 2024 are collected yet. However, data from centers accredited by the American College of Surgeons, which perform about 80% to 83% of all bariatric surgeries in this country, show that volumes were down by 5.5%, or more than 12,000 weight-reduction surgeries, in 2023.",
      "",
      "But 2024 is expected to be \"much, much worse because of the overwhelming impact that the GLP-1 drugs have had, which really took off this year,\" Clapp said.",
      "",
      "This year in El Paso he expects to perform 120 bariatric surgeries, compared with 180 in 2023. \"These are massive decreases in volume, at least for me,\" he said. \"I went from seeing 15 to 20 new bariatric patients weekly to one to three.\"",
      "",
      "The Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery at Columbia University said earlier this year that it expected a 10% to 20% decline in 2024 from 2023.",
      "",
      "That drop in bariatric demand is one of two big reasons why Clapp has made a career decision to leave the solo practice he has built up for the last 18 years.",
      "",
      "Sometime next year, he plans to either take an academic job and devote more time to studying how brain receptors function in rats with obesity, or become an employed hospital surgeon. On staff, he would do any variety of procedures and probably far fewer bariatric procedures on which he has built his practice.",
      "",
      "The other reason is declining reimbursement. Clapp said Medicare rates for common bariatric surgery CPT codes have dropped since 2019, despite rising inflation in practice costs. A check with Medicare's physician fee lookup tool shows he's right. For example, the national payment amount for a laparoscopic gastric bypass with small intestine reconstruction dropped from $1,937.82 to $1,842.13 between 2019 and 2024. Insurance companies generally follow Medicare.",
      "",
      "What's worse is that consultation pay has also been going down or has disappeared. \"Things are bundled more, so you get paid less overall,\" he said. \"It's like death by 1,000 cuts.\" Solo private practice \"has just become a model that's not sustainable, for myself or for my family.\"",
      "",
      "Clapp has filled in some of the blanks with other foregut surgeries, such as cholecystectomies and hernia repairs, but reimbursement rates have dropped for those, too, especially relative to his own practice costs.",
      "",
      "San Diego bariatric surgeon William Fuller, MD, said Scripps Mercy Hospital, one of the largest programs on the West Coast, will have performed around 800 bariatric surgeries in 2024, down from the prior year's 1,000. But he doesn't expect a year-over-year decline in perpetuity as some of his counterparts fear.",
      "",
      "\"Who knows when there will be a stabilization of this whole phenomenon?\" he asked rhetorically during an interview with a public relations representative present. \"But we see patients who tried some of these medications  --  when they had access to them  --  and they haven't had the same success. They had some rebound, regained weight, or just didn't have success to begin with.\"",
      "",
      "Bottom line: \"It's all about sustainability, which is always the case with medications,\" he said. \"How long can you remain on them, and for efficacy purposes and economic purposes, how are these medications going to be funded, with what kind of subsidies? There's still a lot of moving parts.\""

In this administration, and any administration, independent public disagreement isn't welcome.\"",
      "",
      "Kennedy is chair of Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit. He has vowed to curb the country's appetite for ultra-processed food and its incidence of chronic disease. He helped select Trump's choices to lead the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH. If confirmed, he would lead them from the helm of HHS, with its more than $1.7 trillion budget.",
      "",
      "Clashes are likely. Kennedy has supported access to abortion until a fetus is viable. That puts him at odds with Dave Weldon, MD, the former Florida congressman whom Trump has chosen to run the CDC. Weldon, a physician, is an abortion opponent who wrote one of the major laws allowing health professionals to opt out of participating in the procedure.",

      "Trump has said he would leave decisions about abortion to the states, but the CDC under Weldon could, for example, fund studies on abortion risks. The agency could require states to provide information about abortions performed within their borders to the federal government or risk the loss of federal funds.",
      "",
      "Weldon, like Kennedy, has questioned the safety of vaccines and has said he believes they can cause autism. That's at odds with the views of Marty Makary, MD, MPH, a Johns Hopkins surgeon whom Trump plans to nominate for FDA commissioner. The British American said on the \"Brian Kilmeade Show\" on Fox News Radio that vaccines \"save lives,\" although he added that it's good to question the U.S. vaccine schedule for children.",

      "The American Academy of Pediatricians encourages parents and their children's doctors to stick to the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines. \"Nonstandard schedules that spread out vaccines or start when a child is older put entire communities at risk of serious illnesses, including infants and young children,\" the group says in guidance for its members.",

The World Health Organization warned that such an approach would overwhelm hospitals.",

He promoted the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment.

      "Syria's civil war left one of the world's oldest synagogues partially destroyed",
      "JOBAR, Syria -- In this Damascus suburb, the handful of remaining Jews in Syria can again make pilgrimages to one of the world\u2019s oldest synagogues where people from throughout the region once came to pray.",
      "Syria\u2019s 13-year civil war left the synagogue partially destroyed. Walls and roofs have collapsed. Some artifacts are missing. A marble sign in Arabic at the gate says it was first built 720 years before Christ.",
      "Since insurgents overthrew President Bashar Assad in early December, people have been able to safely visit the widely destroyed Jobar suburb that was pounded for years by government forces while in the hands of opposition fighters.",
      "Syria was once home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities. Those numbers have shrunk dramatically, especially after the state of Israel was created in 1948.",
      "Today, only nine Jews live in Syria, according to the head of the community, almost all older men and women. The community believes that no Syrian Jews will remain in the country in a few years.",
      "One of the people visiting the Jobar Synagogue, also known as Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue, on Thursday was gray-haired Bakhour Chamntoub, the head of the community in Syria.",
      "\u201cThis synagogue means a lot to us,\u201d the 74-year-old told The Associated Press during his first visit in 15 years.",
      "Chamntoub had heard the synagogue was damaged, but he did not expect to see that part of it had been reduced to a pile of debris.",
      "\u201cI am frankly disturbed,\u201d he said.",
      "Chamntoub said Jewish people from around the world have been calling him to say they are ready to help rebuild.",
      "He had refused to leave Syria during the war, while all 12 of his siblings left. He said he was happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him.",
      "Chamntoub said he had been one of the few Jews who openly spoke about his faith, adding that he never faced discrimination. He said other Jews preferred not to speak openly for safety reasons amid the animosity in Syria toward archenemy Israel and fears of being labeled spies or collaborators.",
      "The Jewish community in Syria dates back to the prophet Elijah\u2019s Damascus sojourn nearly 3,000 years ago. After 1099, when Christian armies conquered Jerusalem in the First Crusade and massacred the city\u2019s Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, some 50,000 Jews reportedly fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of residents. Another wave of Jews later arrived from Europe, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition that began in 1492.",
      "The community in Syria numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. In the years surrounding Israel's creation, Syrian Jews faced increased tensions and restrictions. Many emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries.",
      "Under the Assad family's 54-year dynasty, Jews in Syria enjoyed freedom in performing religious duties, but community members were prevented from traveling outside the country to prevent them from going to Israel until the early 1990s. Once travel restrictions were lifted after Arab-Israeli peace talks started, many more left.",
      "Before Syria\u2019s conflict began in 2011, Chamntoub and other remaining community members came on Saturdays to Jobar for prayers. He recalled Torahs written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, tapestries and carpets. All are gone, likely stolen by looters.",
      "Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, recounted how worshipers on Saturdays asked him to turn on the lights or light a candle since Jews are not allowed to do physical labor on the Sabbath.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful religious place,\u201d Hazroumi said of the synagogue, which at some point during the war was protected by rebels. It and the whole destroyed suburb \u201cneeds to be reconstructed from scratch.\u201d",
      "Assad\u2019s forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed tight security, preventing many people from reaching the area.",
      "The new rulers of Syria, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have said they will allow members of all religions to perform their religious duties freely. There have been some sectarian attacks but mostly against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect.",
      "After visiting the synagogue, Chamntoub returned to his home in old Damascus, close to the private Jewish school known as Maimonides that was founded in 1944 but has been closed for decades. Posters in Hebrew remain on the walls.",
      "The area is known as the Jewish quarter. Many old homes have doors and windows closed with pieces of metal and a sign in Arabic saying: \u201cThe real estate is closed by the state's Higher Committee for the Affairs of Jews.\u201d",
      "As the Jewish community has shrunk, it has also struggled to find kosher food. Chamntoub receives packages of meat from siblings in the U.S. at least once a year via people traveling to Syria. In the past, he went to the chicken market with a Jewish friend who would slaughter them, but the man now can hardly walk.",
      "Chamntoub mostly eats vegetarian dishes. Almost every morning, he cooks for himself and a Jewish woman in the area with no remaining relatives in Syria.",
      "The woman, 88-year-old Firdos Mallakh, sat on a couch Thursday under two blankets. When asked to greet an AP journalist with \u201cShabbat Shalom,\u201d she replied it was not yet time. \u201cToday is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday,\u201d she said.",
      "Chamntoub, who makes a living as a landlord, asked Mallakh why she had not turned on the gas heater. Mallakh said she did not want to waste gas.",
      "Chamntoub hopes that with the fall of Assad, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. In the past, he said, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without permission from the security agencies.",
      "\u201cI am a Jew and I am proud of it,\u201d he said.",
      "But with so few remaining in Damascus, the city's synagogues see no services. Chamntoub is marking the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which began on Wednesday, alone at home."

    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to have his prostate removed, according to his office",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to have his prostate removed, according to his office",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is having his prostate removed on Sunday, his office said, a procedure that comes as he manages multiple crises at once, including the ongoing war in Gaza and his own trial for alleged corruption.",
      "Netanyahu, 75, is among a cohort of older world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, and President-elect Donald Trump, 78, whose health and physical fitness are under deep scrutiny both at home and abroad because of their advanced age and the effect that could have on their leadership.",
      "Netanyahu, who has had a string of health issues in recent years, has gone to great lengths to bolster a public image of himself as a fully healthy, energetic leader. During his trial this month he boasted about working 18-hour days, even if those long hours are accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could also take a toll on his well-being.",
      "The procedure has already had a fallout: Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer Amit Hadad said in a letter to the court the Israeli prime minister would be fully sedated for the procedure and would be hospitalized for \u201ca number of days,\" asking that his three days of testimony this week be canceled. The court agreed.",
      "An acting prime minister will take over for Netanyahu while he is undergoing the procedure, according to an official familiar with the arrangements, although it wasn\u2019t immediately clear who will step in. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the details behind the procedure with the media.",
      "With so much at stake in the turbulent region, Netanyahu\u2019s health in wartime is a concern for both Israelis and the wider world.",
      "According to Netanyahu\u2019s office, the Israeli leader was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection on Wednesday stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate. The infection was treated successfully with antibiotics but a procedure on Sunday will remove his prostate.",
      "Complications from prostate enlargement are common in men in their 70s and 80s, Dr. Shay Golan, head of the oncology urology service at Israel\u2019s Rabin Medical Center, told Israeli Army Radio.",
      "He said that an enlarged prostate can block proper emptying of the bladder, leading to a build-up of urine that can then lead to an infection or other complications. After medicinal treatment, doctors can recommend a procedure to remove the prostate to prevent future blockages, Golan said.",
      "In Netanyahu\u2019s case, because the prostate is not cancerous, Golan said doctors will likely perform an endoscopic surgery, which is carried out by inserting small instruments into a body cavity, rather than making any surgical cuts in the abdomen to reach the prostate.",
      "The procedure lasts about an hour, Golan said, and recovery is quick. Golan also said that aside from catheter use for one to three days after the procedure, patients can return to normal activity without any significant limitations.",
      "Netanyahu insists he is in excellent health and his office has worked to craft a public image that backs that up. It releases footage of him touring war zones in full protective gear flanked by gruff military officers, or meeting with defense officials on windswept hilltops in youthful dark shades and puffer jackets.",
      "But that image was shattered last year when Netanyahu\u2019s doctors revealed that he had a heart condition, a problem that he had apparently long known about but concealed from the public.",
      "A week after a fainting spell, Netanyahu was urgently fitted with a pacemaker to control his heartbeat. Only then did staff at the Sheba Medical Center reveal that Netanyahu has for years experienced a condition that can cause irregular heartbeats.",
      "That revelation came at a time when Netanyahu was dealing with massive anti-government protests. The news about a chronic heart problem stoked further anger and distrust at a time of extreme political polarization in Israel.",
      "Last year, Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital for what doctors said likely was dehydration, where he stayed overnight, prompting his weekly Cabinet meeting to be delayed.",
      "Earlier this year, Netanyahu underwent hernia surgery, during which he was under full anesthesia and unconscious. His close confidant, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, served as acting prime minister during the operation.",
      "As Israel\u2019s leader, Netanyahu is at the center of major global events that are shifting the Middle East. With the dizzying pace of the past 14 months, being incapacitated for even a few hours can be risky in the current regional maelstrom.",
      "Netanyahu will be in hospital at a time when international mediators are pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as violence there rages on and fighting between Israel and Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels intensifies.",
      "The health issue also shines a new light on Netanyahu\u2019s age. Prostate issues are common and in many cases easily treatable. But they are prominent, especially among older men.",
      "The procedure puts a dent in Netanyahu\u2019s image of vigor at a time when would want to project strength more than ever, both to an Israeli audience navigating constant threats as well as to Israel's enemies looking to expose Israel's weaknesses."

      "Kavelashvili, 53, who was the only candidate on the ballot, easily won the vote earlier in December given the Georgian Dream party\u2019s control of a 300-seat electoral college that replaced direct presidential elections in 2017.

      "In his speech Sunday, Kavelashvili promised to be \u201ceveryone\u2019s president, regardless of whether they like me or not.\u201d He called for the nation to unite behind him around \"shared values, the principles of mutual respect, and the future we should build together.\"",

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he will implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.",
      "During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. \u201cthe most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.\u201d Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into \u201ca nuclear military bloc for aggression.\"",
      "\u201cThis reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,\u201d Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "It said Kim's speech \u201cclarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively\u201d by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security.",
      "KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers.",
      "The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim \u201cfell in love.\u201d But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.",
      "North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.",
      "Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.",
      "Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
      "Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.",

      "Trailing a distant third in the pre-election polls is Marija Selak Raspudi\u0107, a conservative independent candidate. She has focused her election campaign on the economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million.",

      "The year 2024 saw President Vladimir Putin further cement his power as he sought to counter Russia's isolation over the war in Ukraine",
      "In 2024, President Vladimir Putin further cemented his grip on power and sought to counter Russia's isolation from the West over the war in Ukraine. But he faced continuing challenges, with a deadly attack by gunmen in Moscow and an incursion by Kyiv's troops on his territory.",
      "As Russia's nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine enters a new, potentially pivotal phase amid a new U.S. administration and its uncertain support for Kyiv, here's a look back at how the year unfolded for Putin:",
      "Putin ran for a fifth term in office with his top opponents either jailed or exiled abroad. But in a rare show of defiance, thousands of Russians queued in the January cold to sign petitions for an unlikely challenger. Boris Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old legislator and war critic, got the 100,000 signatures needed to put him on the ballot, but election authorities eventually barred him from running. Still, the support he received reflected anti-war sentiment and public longing for political competition in an embarrassment for Putin.",
      "On Feb. 16, Putin's longtime foe Alexei Navalny died in an arctic prison colony while serving a 19-year sentence on charges widely seen as politically motivated. The news of his death at age 47 shocked the world and robbed the opposition of its most charismatic leader. No exact cause of death was given, and his family and allies blamed the Kremlin, which denied involvement. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his Moscow funeral two weeks later in a show of defiance.",
      "On March 17, Putin secured his expected election triumph, which will keep him in office until 2030, following the harshest crackdown on dissent since Soviet times. Five days later, gunmen stormed a concert hall on Moscow's outskirts, killing over 140 people and setting the venue ablaze. An affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility, although the Kremlin, without evidence, tried to blame Ukraine for the deadliest attack on Russian soil in almost two decades. The assault stunned the capital and rekindled memories of other attacks in the early years of Putin\u2019s presidency.",
      "Putin made a two-day visit to North Korea in June \u2014 his first in 24 years \u2014 as the countries deepened their ties in the face of intensifying confrontations with Washington. The pact signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un envisions mutual military assistance if either country is attacked. The new agreement marked their strongest link since the end of the Cold War, adding to concerns in Washington and Seoul.",
      "Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in March 2023 and accused of espionage, was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a swift trial. His employers and the U.S. government denounced the process as a sham and rejected the charges as fabricated. Without presenting evidence, authorities claimed he was gathering secret information for the U.S. Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet immigrants, was the first Western reporter arrested on espionage charges in post-Soviet Russia, in a chilling signal to international journalists.",
      "On Aug. 1, Washington and Moscow completed the biggest East-West prisoner swap in post-Soviet history. Those released included Gershkovich and fellow American Paul Whelan, along with prominent Russian dissidents like Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin. The multinational deal freed two dozen people \u2014 including Vadim Krasikov, serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a former Chechen militant in Berlin.",
      "Also in August, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in the largest cross-border raid by Kyiv\u2019s forces. It exposed Russia\u2019s vulnerabilities and dealt an embarrassing blow to the Kremlin, with tens of thousands of civilians fleeing the region. With the bulk of the Russian army engaged in eastern Ukraine, few troops were left to protect the Kursk region. Russia forces have since regained control over part of the territory but have so far failed to completely dislodge Kyiv's troops.",
      "Putin traveled to regional ally Mongolia in September in a move widely seen as an attempt to counter Western efforts to isolate him over the Ukraine war. Mongolia was among the countries that ratified a treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, which in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Mongolia ignored calls to arrest the Russian leader and gave him a red-carpet welcome, with both countries signing deals on energy supplies and power plant upgrades.",
      "In October, the Pentagon announced North Korea sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to join the fighting against Ukraine \u2014 a move Western leaders said will intensify the war and jolt relations in Asia. Moscow and Pyongyang have remained tight-lipped about the claims of deployment.",
      "Putin also hosted a summit of the BRICS bloc of nations, attended by leaders or representatives of 36 countries, in what many saw as an effort to highlight the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia.",
      "Former President Donald Trump won a new term in the White House in November, raising concerns that his administration would cut military support for Ukraine and force it to negotiate with Moscow. Current President Joe Biden allowed Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied longer-range weapons for deeper strikes on Russian soil.",
      "Russia responded by firing a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile \u2014 called the Oreshnik \u2014 at a city in central Ukraine. Putin boasted the missile can't be intercepted by air defenses. He warned that Moscow could use it for more strikes on Ukraine and also potentially to hit military facilities of NATO countries giving military support to Ukraine.",
      "The government of Syrian leader Bashar Assad crumbled after a lightning offensive by rebels. Putin granted asylum to Moscow's longtime ally Assad and his family, but the Kremlin's failure to prevent his downfall nine years after it intervened militarily to prop up his rule exposed the limits of Russia\u2019s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine.",
      "Then, an embarrassing attack again brought the war to the streets of Moscow. Lt. Gen Igor Kirillov, the chief of Russia\u2019s Radiation, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces, was killed alongside an aide by a bomb planted outside his apartment building. Putin described Kirillov\u2019s killing as a \u201cmajor blunder\u201d by security agencies.",
      "On the final weekend of the year, Putin apologized for what he called a \u201ctragic incident\" in Russian airspace involving the Dec. 25 crash of an Azerbaijani jetliner that killed 38 people in neighboring Kazakhstan. His statement came amid mounting allegations the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses trying to stop a Ukrainian drone attack near Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya. While Russian officials acknowledged that air defense systems were at work, Putin's apology to Azerbaijan's leader stopped short of saying Moscow took responsibility."

      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story is below:",
      "A passenger plane burst into flames Sunday after it skid off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing at least 62 people, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters.",
      "The National Fire Agency said the fire was almost put out but officials were still trying to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane carrying 181 people at the airport in the town of Muan, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Seoul.",
      "At least 62 people \u2014 37 women and 25 men \u2014 had died in the fire, the agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people \u2014 one passenger and one crew member. It said it deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire.",
      "Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility.

      "Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame.",

Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, making Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over.",
      "Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew before he headed to Muan. Yoon\u2019s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash."

      "TORONTO -- Two Canadian Cabinet ministers left a meeting at Mar-a-Lago on Friday without assurances President-elect Donald Trump will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "The Canadians called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d and said there would be further discussions but one official said the Americans remain fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada.",
      "Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly met with Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, as well as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and fentanyl into the United States \u2014 even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "\u201cMinister LeBlanc and Minister Joly had a positive, productive meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum, as a follow-up to the dinner between the Prime Minister and President Trump last month,\u201d said Jean-S\u00e9bastien Comeau, a spokesman for LeBlanc.",
      "Comeau said both ministers outlined the measures in Canada's billion-dollar plan to increase security at the border and reiterated \u201cthe shared commitment to strengthen border security as well as combat the harm caused by fentanyl to save Canadian and American lives.\u201d",
      "Comeau said Lutnick and Burgum agreed to relay the information to Trump.",
      "A senior Canadian official, however, said the Americans remain preoccupied on the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and want it to shrink. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "Trump has made an issue of the U.S. trade deficit, erroneously calling it a subsidy.",
      "Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and said there is a deficit when oil prices are high.",

      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Further discussions are expected in the coming weeks. Joly will also have dinner with U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham on Friday.",
      "Trump has been trolling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on social media in recent weeks by calling him the Governor of the 51st state.",

      "\u201cIn our darkest hours Canada has been with us,\u201d Brokaw says in the video. \u201cIn the long history of sovereign neighbors there has never been a relationship as close, productive and peaceful as the U.S. and Canada.\u201d",
      "Trudeau has told Trump that Americans would also suffer if the president-elect follows through on a plan to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.",
      "Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.",
      "Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs are vastly different at the U.S.\u2019s two land borders. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. \u2014 where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually \u2014 is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.",
      "On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",
      "The Biden administration has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok\u2019s legal filing said, adding that the U.S. fears are predicated on future risks.",
      "In its filing Friday, the Biden administration said because TikTok \u201cis integrated with ByteDance and relies on its propriety engine developed and maintained in China,\u201d its corporate structure carries with it risk."

      "WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her agency will need to start taking \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling, as early as January 14, in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling \u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Joe Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \u201cAnything else is a betrayal of our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \u201cTreasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",
      "Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate in the new year, have big plans to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and other priorities but debate over how to pay for them."

      "529 college savings plans \u202fare powerful tools to help pay for the mounting costs of an education. Why are some people hesitant to use them?",
      "One common concern is oversaving. You can use 529 funds to cover only\u202f qualified education expenses \u202fwithout incurring a tax penalty, but it can be hard to pinpoint how much money you actually need.",
      "Many parents open 529s for their children when they are born; they have no way of knowing whether their kids will earn a scholarship or even go to college at all. Fortunately, parents of multiple children can change the beneficiary of a 529 plan.",
      "But what do you do if you still have money left over after covering education expenses?",
      "Thanks to\u202f Secure 2.0, college savers won\u2019t have to worry about overfunding their 529s. Starting this year, you can now\u202f roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA. But don\u2019t think the 529 rollover is a loophole to save extra for retirement; there are rules that limit the conversions.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should consider when converting your 529 funds to a Roth IRA.",
      "The Roth IRA receiving the funds must be in the name of the 529 plan beneficiary.",
      "The 529 plan must be open for at least 15 years.",
      "You cannot convert 529 contributions made within the past five years (or the earnings on those contributions).",
      "The 529 funds you roll over count toward your IRA annual contribution limit.",
      "You can move a maximum of $35,000 from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA during your lifetime.",
      "529 funds must be converted by paying the amount directly to a Roth IRA\u2014you can\u2019t pay yourself and then deposit the money into the Roth IRA later.",
      "You can contribute to a Roth IRA only if you have earnings from a job, so the 529 beneficiary must have eligible earnings when the 529-to-IRA conversions occur.",
      "Roth IRA income limits do not apply to 529 rollovers.",
      "While avoiding the\u202f Roth IRA \u202fincome limits is a retirement-saving perk for those with higher income, the rest of the rules around rolling over your excess 529 funds are designed to ensure that people are using 529 plans for their intended purpose: education. The annual contribution limits as well as the lifetime cap on conversions mean that you can\u2019tdouble up on your retirement funding.",
      "So, what\u2019s the bottom line?",
      "The ability to convert unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA can help alleviate potential concerns about oversaving for education. Still, don\u2019t count on your 529 as a means to save for retirement. Instead, consider funding your Roth IRA separately.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "ATLANTA -- A woman died and two other people were hospitalized with injuries after an overnight fire at a Tyson Foods plant in southwest Georgia, state officials said Friday.",
      "A wall fell on the cab of an 18-wheel truck parked outside the plant, Mitchell County Coroner Robby Willis told The Associated Press, killing the wife of a truck driver who was asleep inside. He identified the victim as Bajarma Batozhapov, 61, of Las Vegas.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents 1,600 workers at the plant, said Friday that a boiler had exploded. Tyson said it was working with local authorities to determine the cause of the fire. Officials said a fire burned for about three hours.",
      "Heavy equipment was required to remove debris from the truck and Willis said that the woman's body wasn't recovered until about 2 p.m. Friday. The woman's husband wasn't in the truck and wasn't injured, he said. Willis declined to state a cause of death for the woman, and said an autopsy would be performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on Monday.",
      "\u201cWe extend our deepest condolences to their family and friends during this difficult time. Right now we are still gathering the facts, but ensuring the safety of our team members is our top priority, and we are conducting a full investigation into the cause of the fire,\u201d Tyson said in a statement.",
      "Bryce Rawson, a spokesperson for the Georgia State Fire Marshal's Office, confirmed the death and injuries but said he couldn't share anything further Friday afternoon since the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The plant in Camilla, which has a population of about 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Mitchell County. Tyson bought it in 2018 as part of its $2.16 billion purchase of Keystone Foods. The union said the plant primarily produces chicken nuggets and chicken fillets for restaurants.",
      "\u201cAgriculture is the backbone of our economy down here and Tyson is a major part of that,\u201d Camilla Mayor Kelvin Owens said.",
      "Owens said Tyson is more than just an employer to the city.",
      "\u201cNot only are they important to the economy, they\u2019re important to us as people,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe consider them family and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to support them during this time.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",

      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",

In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people&rsquo;s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat &mdash; large banks of batteries",
    "story": [
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people\u2019s lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home now when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries",
      "2024 was another banner year for a source of electricity that is better for people's lungs, better for climate change and may be reaching your home when you turn on the lights or turn up the thermostat \u2014 large banks of batteries.",
      "This ability to store large amounts of electricity in batteries was essentially nonexistent a decade ago, but the country had about 24 gigawatt-hours operating as of the end of November, up a whopping 71% over the same date in 2023.",
      "This is welcome news to clean energy advocates including Dariella Rodriguez. She has seen what happens on days when demand for air conditioning or heating spikes and extra power plants fueled by natural gas, located in Port Morris and Mott Haven, fire up not far from where she works in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, New York.",
      "Batteries can jolt into service, sending electricity onto overhead wires, instead of these dirty \u201cpeaker\u201d plants. Rodriguez hasn't seen that transition yet, but she hopes to.",
      "\u201cThe people that are exposed to these plants are the most vulnerable people in environmental justice communities already,\u201d said Rodriguez, a director at THE POINT Community Development Corporation there, noting that lower-income people and communities of color often live near peakers.",
      "The nation\u2019s 1,000 peaker plants can be very dirty, inefficient and expensive, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog group that works for the U.S. Congress. Some 63 million people are estimated to live within a three-mile radius of one.",
      "Although peakers run only a small part of the time, they release more harmful nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide per unit of energy, the agency said. Those two pollutants cause asthma and other breathing problems.",
      "Peakers also release more greenhouse gases than other power plants do per unit of electricity.",
      "Batteries are \u201ca really obvious solution\u201d to reducing need for peakers, says Daniel Chu, senior energy planner for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance.",
      "Storing extra power in batteries also extends the hours of the day that you can use clean energy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always sunny, the wind\u2019s not always blowing, but energy storage can help move that generation to when it\u2019s most needed,\u201d said Tim Fox, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners.",
      "That's why at least half of battery storage facilities in the U.S. are co-located with, or in some other way support solar, an AP analysis of Energy Information Administration data shows. The amount of solar energy in the U.S. is growing and surpassed the 100-gigawatt mark this year.",
      "Another way that the addition of these batteries is helpful to the American electrical grid and grids around the world is that forecasting is getting more difficult.",
      "\u201cWith weather patterns changing, the old ways of essentially figuring out how much capacity you need on the grid for extreme events just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Oliver Garnett, director of energy services product at the technology company Fermata Energy.",
      "Last, global electricity demand is slated to increase \u2014 by about one-third to three-quarters by 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. Data centers for artificial intelligence, switching vehicles to electricity and population growth are all contributing.",
      "\u201c\u2018Do we have enough power plants?\u2019 is the classic question every utility asks every year,\u201d said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the science nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThe beauty of the batteries is that if there\u2019s energy in them, they can be used for unexpected needs.\u201d",
      "Otherwise, if utilities have to find more power generation, they may keep investing in plants that burn gas or coal and account for one-quarter of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, instead of retiring them.",
      "Leading the charge for adding new batteries to the grid this year was California with more than 11 gigawatt-hours operating. One way to think about this is roughly the amount of electricity that a nuclear power plant would put out over 11 hours. Then the batteries would need to be recharged to do the same thing again. It's a limited, but meaningful amount of power. In Texas, 6 gigawatt-hours were online. Arizona saw nearly 2 gigawatt-hours humming and Nevada \u2014 the fourth-largest deployer of storage in the U.S. \u2014 had 1.1 gigawatt-hours operational.",
      "Yet many states aren't using storage yet. As of November, 86% of large-scale battery storage in the U.S. was operating in just those four states.",
      "Some states haven't set targets telling utilities to go out and build or buy energy storage on their own. Only 18 states have 50 megawatt-hours or more operating.",
      "Others don't have as much clean electricity to pair with the batteries, or claim storage isn\u2019t reliable in times of crisis. It can also be challenging to connect storage to the grid. Still, experts expect more momentum.",
      "Especially in California and Texas, \u201cThat investment and that experiment is paying off very well,\u201d said John Hensley, senior vice president of markets and policy analysis at American Clean Power.",
      "\u201cThe word is getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly seeing the technology move to other parts of the country.\u201d",

      "Remember this moment because it probably won't last: A U.S. lottery jackpot soared above $1 billion, and that's still a big deal.",
      "After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated $1.22 billion was sold in California for the drawing Friday night. The high number evoked headlines and likely lured more people to convenience stores with dreams of private spacewalks above the Earth.",
      "It doesn't seem to matter that the nation's top 10 jackpots, not including Friday, already boasted 10-figure payouts. For many of us, something stirs inside when a number ticks one dollar above $999,999,999.",
      "\u201cThe question lurking is, what happens when $1 billion becomes routine and people don\u2019t care about it anymore?\u201d said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of the 2022 book \u201cFor a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's no easy round number after a billion,\u201d Cohen said. \"But also, how much money can one person possibly, possibly, possibly need?\u201d",
      "Mega Millions ticket prices are set to rise from $2 to $5 in April. The increase will be one of many changes that officials say will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts.",
      "Here's brief history of lotteries and why jackpots are growing:",
      "Cohen notes in his book that lotteries have existed in one form or another for more than 4,000 years.",
      "In Rome, emperors and nobles held drawings at dinner parties and awarded prizes that ranged from terra cotta vases to people who were enslaved. As early as the 1400s, lotteries were used in Europe to fund city defenses and other public works.",
      "Sweepstakes were common in the American colonies, helping to pay for the revolution against Britain. Cohen noted in his book that Thomas Jefferson approved of lotteries, writing that they were a tax \u201claid on the willing only.\u201d",
      "Lotteries began to fall out of favor in the U.S. in the 1800s because of concerns over fraud, mismanagement and impacts on poor people. But starting in the 1960s, states began to legalize them to help address financial shortfalls without raising taxes.",
      "\u201cLotteries were seen as budgetary miracles, the chance for states to make revenue appear seemingly out of thin air,\u201d Cohen wrote.",
      "When Mega Millions started in 1996, it was called \u201cThe Big Game\u201d and involved only six states. It was meant to compete with Powerball, which then had 20 states and the District of Columbia.",
      "The original payout for The Big Game started at $5 million. The value would be nearly twice that today accounting for inflation.",
      "In 2024 dollars, the before-taxes prize could buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution or cover Michael Soroka's $9 million contract to pitch next season for the Washington Nationals.",
      "By contrast, the pre-tax winnings from Friday\u2019s Mega Millions prize could theoretically buy a Major League Baseball team. The Nationals would be too expensive. But Forbes recently valued the Miami Marlins at $1 billion.",
      "A better comparison might be Taylor Swift's tour revenue at the end of 2023. Her Eras Tour became the first to earn more than $1 billion after selling more than 4 million tickets.",
      "Swift, however, was expected to bring in a total of more than $2 billion when her tour finally wrapped up Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "These days, Mega Millions and its lottery compatriot Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico.",
      "In October, Mega Millions said it hoped increased ticket revenue and less stratospheric odds would lead to more people winning, even as prizes grow extraordinarily high.",
      "Games with massive payouts tend to be more popular despite the slimmer odds. Larger jackpots also attract more media attention, increase ticket sales and bring in new players, Cohen said.",
      "Lottery officials have allowed the odds to become lower with a larger pool of numbers to pick from, Cohen said. And that has made games harder to win, leading to payouts rolling over into even larger prizes.",
      "The first $1 billion jackpot was in 2016. Cohen said he expects the upward trajectory to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, he warned against the tropes of the troubled or bankrupt lottery winner.",
      "A well-known example is Andrew \u201cJack\u201d Whittaker Jr. He won a record Powerball jackpot after buying a single ticket in 2002 but quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks as he endured constant requests for money, leaving him unable to trust others.",
      "Most winners don't turn out like him, Cohen said.",
      "\u201cEven if we deny it, we all sort of believe in the meritocracy \u2014 this belief that if you won your money through luck, then you probably didn\u2019t actually deserve it,\u201d Cohen said. And yet various studies have shown \u201clottery winners are happier, healthier and wealthier than the rest of us.\u201d",

      "A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week.",
      "The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024.",
      "Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts.",
      "Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market\u2019s path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump\u2019s preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt and difficulties for global trade.",
      "Amedisys rose 4.7% after the home health care and hospice services provider agreed to extend the deadline for its sale to UnitedHealth Group. The Justice Department had sued to block the $3.3 billion deal, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The move to extend the deadline comes ahead of an expected shift in regulatory policy under Trump. The incoming administration is expected to have a more permissive approach to dealmaking and is less likely to raise antitrust concerns.",
      "In Asia, Japan\u2019s benchmark index surged as the yen remained weak against the dollar. Stocks in South Korea fell after the main opposition party voted to impeach the country\u2019s acting leader.",
      "Markets in Europe gained ground.",
      "Bond yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.62% from 4.59% late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury remained at 4.33% from late Thursday.",
      "Wall Street will have more economic updates to look forward to next week, including reports on pending home sales and home prices. There will also be reports on U.S. construction spending and snapshots of manufacturing activity."

      "The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a rule that cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos",
      "WASHINGTON -- Cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos under a federal rule proposed Thursday.",
      "The proposal from the Food and Drug Administration and mandated by Congress is intended to reassure consumers about the safety of makeup, baby powder and other personal care products.",
      "It follows years of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson and other companies alleging links between talc-based baby powder and cancer.",
      "Despite the lawsuits, research has found mixed evidence of a potential link between cancer and talc, although the possibility has been recognized for decades because of how it is mined.",
      "Talc is a mineral used to absorb moisture or improve the texture, feel and color of cosmetics. It is mined from underground deposits that are sometimes located near the toxic mineral asbestos. The risk of cross contamination has long been recognized by cosmetic companies.",
      "But recent FDA-sponsored testing hasn't uncovered any safety issues. Since 2021, laboratory analysis of more than 150 cosmetic samples has come back negative for asbestos, according to the FDA.",
      "Still, concerns about the risk prompted Congress to pass a 2023 law requiring the FDA to release new industry standards for asbestos testing.",
      "Dr. Linda Katz, the director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said in a statement that the agency has \u201ccarefully considered the scientific evidence and complex policy issues related to detecting and identifying asbestos in talc and talc-containing cosmetic products.\u201d",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\u201d Katz said.",
      "The long-running litigation against J&J alleges that the company\u2019s talc baby powder caused women to develop ovarian cancer, when used for feminine hygiene.",
      "A J&J subsidiary has proposed paying roughly $8 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits. As part of the deal, the subsidiary would declare bankruptcy, although that proposal has been challenged in court by the Justice Department.",
      "J&J removed talc from its baby powder in the U.S. market in 2020 and then internationally in 2023. The company says it continues to stand by the safety of its products.",
      "Determining the root cause of cancer is difficult, especially in cases of ovarian cancer, which is a relatively rare form of the disease. Even large studies in thousands of women might not gather enough data to show a clear connection or definitively rule one out. The American Cancer Society says that, if there is an increased risk of cancer due to talc, \u201cit is likely to be very small.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose for the second week in a row to its highest level since mid-July, reflecting a recent jump in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price home loans.",
      "The rate rose to 6.85% from 6.72% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. One year ago, the rate on a 30-year mortgage averaged 6.61%.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now the highest it\u2019s been since the week of July 11, when it was at 6.89%. It dipped as low as 6.08% in September \u2014 a 2-year low \u2014 and as high as 7.22% in May,",
      "Most economists forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% next year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%. That range would be largely in line with where rates have hovered this year.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan at a lower rate, also rose this week. The average rate increased to 6% from 5.92% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.93%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market remains in a slump and on track for its worst year since 1995.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the moves in the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds.",
      "Bond yields climbed last week after the Federal Reserve signaled that it will likely deliver fewer cuts to rates next year than it forecast just a few months ago. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The biggest wildcard for mortgage rates next year is whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives will contribute to higher inflation and swell the national debt, which could keep mortgage rates elevated. That\u2019s because what happens with inflation, the U.S. deficit and the economy can have an effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The yield, which was below 3.7% as recently as September, was at 4.61% in midday trading Thursday.",

      "Here are a few takeaways on electric vehicles in 2024: As of November, the global EV market grew by 25% year-over-year",
      "DETROIT -- Electric vehicles had another whirlwind year around the globe, driven by buyers in China, and growth in parts of Europe and the United States, despite headwinds.",
      "In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs.",
      "Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy. Road transport accounts for around one-sixth of all global emissions from energy, according to the International Energy Agency. Widespread EV adoption could significantly address climate change.",
      "Here are five facts about EVs this year. Most of the data comes from consultancy Rho Motion.",
      "The global EV market, including pure EVs and plug-in hybrids, grew by 25% year-over-year as of November.",
      "Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China.",
      "Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion.",
      "Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase.",
      "Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline.",
      "In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales.",
      "In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs.",
      "The best-selling pure electric vehicles were the Tesla Model Y, followed by the Tesla Model 3 \u2014 both globally and in the U.S., according to Rho Motion.",
      "The Model Y SUV was released in 2020. Its base version today costs nearly $45,000.",
      "The Model 3 was released in 2017. The least expensive version sells for around $42,000.",
      "Both have been eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S.",
      "Tesla's market share stood at 17% of all electric cars across the globe through October, according to Rho Motion.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla's market share was 49% through October. That means the company still has the biggest EV market share. But its hold is shrinking as other auto companies combined sell a growing number of electrics. For example, GM, Ford, Honda and more are offering a wider variety of EVs at lower prices and sizes and are chipping away at Tesla's longstanding lead.",

      "Continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, climbed by 46,000 to 1.91 million for the week of Dec. 14. That's more than analysts projected and the most since the week of Nov. 13, 2021 when the labor market was still recovering from the COVID-19 jobs wipeout in the spring of 2020.",
      "The rising level of continuing claims suggests that some who are receiving benefits are finding it harder to land new jobs. That could mean that demand for workers is waning, even though the economy remains strong.",

      "The labor market has hinted at some softening recently but remains broadly healthy and has held up better than many economists predicted considering that interest rates have been elevated for years.

      "The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands, but was described by Finnish customs officials and the European Union's executive commission as part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions amid the war in Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. Russia's use of the vessels has raised environmental concerns about accidents given their age and uncertain insurance coverage.",
      "The Eagle S's anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle television reported, relying on police statements.",
      "The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement that the incident was \u201cthe latest in a series of suspected attacks on critical infrastructure\u201d and commended the Finnish authorities \u201cfor their swift action in boarding the suspected vessel.\"",
      "The ship \u201cis part of Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, which threatens security and the environment, while funding Russia\u2019s war budget,\u201d said Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister. \"We will propose further measures, including sanctions, to target this fleet.\u201d",

      "Thousands of workers are facing an unsettling reality heading into 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- Jason LaCroix felt privileged to work from home, especially as a father to two young children. He needed flexibility when his son, then 6, suffered a brain injury and spent 35 days in intensive care.",
      "LaCroix, a senior systems engineer based in Atlanta, took time off and then worked from home while managing his son's care and appointments. But LaCroix was laid off last February from that job, where he'd been working remotely for five years. His new role requires him to spend four days a week in a company office and commute for three hours a day.",
      "\u201cI want to be around for my kids,\u201d LaCroix, 44, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to be around for my son, because we almost lost him.\u201d",
      "Heading into 2025, thousands of workers face an unsettling reality: after years of working from the comfort of home, they must return to the office full-time for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic or look for new work.",
      "Employees at Amazon, AT&T and other companies have been called back to the office five days per week. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to fire federal workers who don't show up to do their jobs in-person.",
      "\u201cPeople always want to have flexibility,\u201d said Mark Ma, a University of Pittsburgh associate professor of business administration. \u201cI have never heard anyone telling me that I thank my job because it\u2019s so rigid in its schedule.\u201d",
      "Ma researched what happened when technology and finance companies in the S&P 500 stopped allowing employees to work remotely in recent years. He found the companies experienced high turnover rates after implementing return-to-office mandates, especially among female employees \u2014 who often have childcare responsibilities \u2014 and senior-level executives.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people have adjusted their lives. They\u2019ve figured out, \u2018Oh wow, I can pick my kids up for school. Wow. I can caretake for my aging parents while I am still working,'\" said Shavon Terrell-Camper, a therapist and mental wellness coach. \u201cOnce you have tasted work-from-home ... it\u2019s difficult to see your life going back to something that could\u2019ve been unsustainable from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Workers and experts have advice to share about how to navigate the changes when an employer calls you back to the office.",
      "Employers can compromise if their goal is to increase how much time staff members spend together. Ma suggests an \u201cemployee-choice\u201d approach which gives teams the authority to decide how many days they will work in the office as a group.",
      "If that's not an option, employees also can ask to adjust their hours. LaCroix leaves home at 5 a.m. and works in the office until 2 p.m. to reduce time in traffic and allow him to be home when his kids get off the bus after school. His employer requires eight hours in the workplace but is flexible on which hours.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are pushing back, and they are trying to work out scenarios to see what type of flexibility does exist within the mandate,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Some are coming up with work-arounds that aren't endorsed by upper management. \u201cCoffee badging\u201d is a technique that involves heading to the office, swiping a company ID, having a coffee and leaving to work from home. Desperate to hold onto valuable employees, supervisors have tried a \u201chushed hybrid\u201d approach, where they take their subordinates\u2019 ID badges and swipe them \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d to make it appear they\u2019ve been in the office, Ma said.",
      "It's best to have an honest conversation with a manager about any personal needs and to \u201cask for forgiveness ahead of time, because your family is the most important thing,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. Many companies have employee assistance programs that do more than most people realize, such as directing employees to resources that can help them care for parents or children, she said.",
      "Medical conditions can make it especially challenging to work on-site. Kyle Ankney, a public relations strategist based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has cerebral palsy and needs a nurse to help him change a catheter three times a day. His health insurance will only send a nurse to one location, so working in an office isn't an option.",
      "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t an issue, I could find my way into the office,\u201d he said.",
      "Ankney, who ran his own PR firm for years, was seeking director-level roles, but a recruiter told him he should consider less-senior roles because of his need to work remotely. Instead, he applied to director-level jobs that were advertised as on-site or hybrid, and then reached out to explain his circumstances and ask if the hiring companies were open to him working from home.",
      "\u201cWhile I would never normally, especially in a career setting, lead with, \u2018I have cerebral palsy and I\u2019m in a wheelchair,\u2019 I\u2019m finding that I'm almost having to make myself vulnerable in that way just to see if the opportunity is even there for me,\u201d Ankney said.",
      "Landing a fully remote job can be competitive. \u201cThere are going to be many people that don\u2019t have the luxury just to leave\" their current jobs if they're required to return to the office, \"especially in a volatile market such as we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Attorney Holly Keerikatte was recently working on-site five days a week at a hospital, commuting about three hours a day and looking for a role that allowed more time with her family. She received two job offers. One was fully remote. The other paid 50% more but required a long commute. She recalled reading the phrase, \u201cThe only people who remember you worked late are your children.\u201d She chose the remote job.",
      "\u201cMy primary driver is what\u2019s best for my family,\u201d Keerikatte said. \u201cMy advice is to be up-front and transparent about what you want, what you\u2019re looking for and why.\"",
      "When faced with the inevitability of returning to an office, look for the positives. Friendships can blossom as colleagues take coffee breaks together or sample new lunch spots. In-person conversations can spark ideas that wouldn\u2019t surface at home.",
      "Employers can ease the transition by organizing activities that create camaraderie. For example, managers can put together a series of talks about the transition and have groups share what works for them, Dufrane said.",
      "Face-to-face contact allows people to better understand what colleagues are thinking and doing, which helps prevent resentment and can provide helpful feedback.",
      "Video director Deborah Ann DeSnoo, who owns Plug-In Inc., a video production company in Chofu, Japan, says she has worked in many countries where the film industry was male-dominated and female directors like her were uncommon. She makes a point to connect with colleagues in person, giving her a chance to bond.",
      "\u201cYou can read the air in a different way, and you find a solution,\u201d DeSnoo said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a Zoom and they ignore you, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d",

      "When LeBron James broke another NBA record earlier this month, the one for most regular-season minutes played in a career, his Los Angeles Lakers teammates handled the moment in typical locker room fashion.",
      "They made fun of him.",
      "\u201cThey told me I\u2019m old as hell,\u201d James quipped.",
      "By NBA standards, they\u2019re not wrong. He was dubbed \u201cThe Kid from Akron\u201d when the Ohio native entered the league with a limitless future nearly 22 years ago. He's now the 40-year-old from Los Angeles with wisps of gray in his beard. His milestone birthday comes Monday, one that will make him the first player in NBA history to play in his teens, 20s, 30s and 40s.",
      "Such a feat has happened a couple of dozen times in baseball before. It has happened in hockey \u2014 Gordie Howe was a five-decade player, appearing in the NHL from his teens to his 50s \u2014 but never in the NFL or the NBA. Until now. James is making more basketball history and creating a club all of his own.",
      "\u201cIn some ways he\u2019s a freak of nature,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of great players and he\u2019s one of the hardest-working players I\u2019ve been around. I mean, he doesn\u2019t take a day off. He seems to not take an afternoon off. He\u2019s always working on some part of his body. You meet with him and he\u2019s always soaking something or eating something with some contraption attached to him.\u201d",
      "A 40th birthday, in NBA terms, means the on-court end is near. James will become the 30th player to appear in a regular-season game with a \u201c4\u201d as the first digit of his age; only nine logged more than 51 games after that birthday. He\u2019ll be the 32nd player to play after turning 40 overall; Tim Duncan and Danny Schayes both turned 40 during playoff runs in what became their final seasons.",
      "And for the most part, big numbers are largely nonexistent at that age.",
      "Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who did it three times), John Stockton (twice), Michael Jordan, Robert Parish and Karl Malone have averaged more than 10 points in a season after turning 40. Jordan averaged 22.4 points in 30 games after turning 40 in his final season with Washington; Malone is the most recent to do it, averaging 13.2 points in 42 games after turning 40 while with the Lakers in 2003-04.",
      "James, meanwhile, is still putting up All-Star level numbers: 23.5 points, 9 assists and 7.5 rebounds per game. Forget how doing that at 40 is unheard of. Doing that at 30 is practically unheard of. The only players to have those numbers in all three categories in a season after turning 30 are James (who did it at 33 and 35) and James Harden (who did it at 31).",
      "\u201cThe size, the strength and the IQ \u2026 with his frame and the way he takes care of himself, he doesn\u2019t have to be the best athlete on the planet. At one time he was,\u201d Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the best athlete in the association. He was the best athlete on the planet arguably, just size, strength, agility, explosiveness combined. But at this size and if he just wants to slow the game down and just play off his brain and IQ, he could do that for another decade. I doubt he\u2019ll find interest in that. But he could.\u201d",
      "Nobody knows when James will stop playing. And it surely isn't going to get any easier: James wanted to play all 82 games this season and couldn't, was widely criticized when the Lakers went through a slump earlier this season and took tons of backlash when his team drafted his son Bronny in the second round last summer in what many thought was simple nepotism.",
      "He has always been a lightning rod. If his play declines at 40, his naysayers will be lined up to revel in that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder, physically and emotionally, to face what those guys face night after night after night,\" Golden State coach Steve Kerr said of top NBA stars getting up in years, like James and the Warriors' Stephen Curry \u2014 who'll turn 37 in March. \"There\u2019s a reason players have to retire. You know, they can\u2019t do it forever.\u201d",
      "James won't either.",
      "But even while playing alongside elite 30-year-olds like Giannis Antetokounmpo, James \u2014 who reportedly spends more than $1.5 million annually on his fitness and has an on-site mechanic of sorts at all times for anything his body needs in personal athletic training guru in Mike Mancias \u2014 has shown how to play long past what used to be considered an NBA player\u2019s peak years.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done is incredible, never been done, especially at the level he\u2019s playing,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cFor me, I always look at the other players that kind of set the blueprint for us, and this is something that\u2019s never been done before. I definitely want to play late into my career, like 37, 38, 39, as much as my body can allow me to play. But I have to do a good job of taking care of my body, which I believe I do, but he kind of set the path for us, set the blueprint for us. We\u2019ve just got to follow.\"",
      "The accolades are countless: James is the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring leader, has a place in the GOAT conversation, most minutes played, four NBA championships, three Olympic gold medals, 20 and likely soon to be 21 All-Star selections, oldest to do this, oldest to do that, generational wealth with a net worth exceeding $1 billion, and on and on and on.",
      "It begs the question: What does one get a 40-year-old who has everything?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even know,\u201d lamented Bronny James \u2014 another example of how James is one of one, becoming the first dad in NBA history to have his son as a teammate.",
      "James has hinted that the end is near. \u201cDon\u2019t make me feel old right now,\u201d he said, only half-kiddingly, when asked earlier this month about the looming 40th birthday. He is under contract for next season but hasn\u2019t offered any guarantees about how long he will play, saying he isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to play that much longer, to be completely honest\u201d and insisting that he won\u2019t be \u201cplaying till the wheels fall off\u201d because he doesn\u2019t want to disrespect the game.",
      "No player scored more points in his teens than James did. Same goes for his 20s. Only Malone and Abdul-Jabbar scored more points in their 30s than James. And now, here comes his 40s, with James still going strong.",
      "It's the final decade of a basketball career like none other.",
      "\u201cFans pay attention every time he steps on the court because they\u2019re watching one of the greatest ever and still playing an incredibly high level, despite turning 40 this month,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI marvel at him.\u201d",

      "The 27-year-old Japanese player will play her first match since she suffered a back injury in the China Open in October at the ASB tennis classic in Auckland on Monday.",
      "Osaka told a pre-tournament news conference in Auckland on Sunday she was \u201chumbled\u201d by her form in 2024 in which she picked up her professional career after an almost 15 month break for the birth of her first child. She ended the season ranked 58.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the type of player that would hang around,\u201d Osaka told reporters. \u201cI have a lot of respect for all the players on tour, but the point of my life that I\u2019m at right now, if I\u2019m not above a certain ranking, I don\u2019t see myself playing for a while.",

      "Osaka had a 22-17 win-loss singles record in 2024, reaching the quarterfinals at Doha and at s-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI think 2024 humbled me, but I also feel like I grew a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked way harder than I\u2019ve ever worked before. So in that, I guess it was very painful to not get the results I wanted, but I feel like I\u2019m growing and learning and I am really excited for this year (2025).",
      "\u201cI played really good matches. People still talk to me about my Iga (Swiatek) match at the French Open (lost 7-6 1-6 7-5). So I\u2019m glad that I was able to give people memories as well.",
      "\u201cEven though I got injured in Beijing, which was my last tournament, I feel pretty optimistic about how that match would have turned out (against Coco Gauff) and I am excited to play on hardcourt again.\u201d",
      "Osaka won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020. She says she still has a deep love for tennis, despite recent injury setbacks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been playing tennis since I was three, and a huge part of that I owe to my parents, but I never really saw my life doing anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, when I sat there and had the opportunity to do other things, I realized that I\u2019d rather be playing tennis.",
      "\u201cSo it was kind of one of those realization moments where you feel like you thought you were forced to do something, but in actuality you very much truly loved it.\u201d",
      "Osaka will play Lina Glushko of Israel in the first round of the ASB Classic.",

      "BRISBANE, Australia -- On the eve of his return to the court, Novak Djokovic has weighed in on tennis\u2019s high-profile doping cases and criticized what he perceives as double standards in the sport.",
      "The former world No. 1, who is chasing a record 25th Grand Slam title at next month\u2019s Australian Open, expressed his frustration Sunday at being \u201ckept in the dark\u201d regarding top-ranked Jannik Sinner\u2019s doping case.",
      "Djokovic is the top seed in the Brisbane International this week, making his first appearance at the event since 2009. He will also team up with Australia\u2019s Nick Kyrgios in doubles, with the duo headlining Monday\u2019s action.",
      "Off the court, Djokovic lent his voice Sunday to Kyrgios\u2019s strong criticisms made a day earlier, speaking out at length about the ongoing doping case involving current world No.1 Jannik Sinner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not questioning whether (Sinner) took the banned substance intentionally or not,\u201d Djokovic said at a press conference Sunday in Brisbane. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of players in the past and currently under suspension for not even testing positive to banned substances.",
      "\u201cSome players with lower rankings waiting for their case to be resolved for over a year. I\u2019ve been really frustrated ... to see we\u2019ve been kept in the dark for at least five months ( on the Sinner case ).\u201d",
      "The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) charged both Sinner and former women\u2019s world No.1 Iga Swiatek with anti-doping breaches earlier in the year.",
      "Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but avoided a ban after the ITIA ruled he was not at fault. The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed the decision.",
      "Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine.",
      "The Serbian further criticized the lack of transparency from tennis authorities regarding doping breaches.",
      "\u201cThe ATP hasn\u2019t really talked in depth about it. Why have they kept that case away from the public? We see Simona Halep\u2019s case on the WTA Tour, now Iga Swiatek\u2019s case,\u201d Djokovic said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a good image for our sport. I\u2019m just questioning the way the system works and why certain players aren\u2019t treated the same as others. Maybe some ranking reasons are behind it, or some players have more financial backing and stronger legal teams to tackle these cases.\u201d",
      "Despite his frustrations, Djokovic remains focused on the season ahead. After undergoing knee surgery earlier this year, he returned to reach the Wimbledon final but skipped the end-of-year ATP Finals, where Sinner capped a dominant season with his eighth title.",
      "Djokovic is looking to extend his legacy at Melbourne Park, where he has claimed 10 Australian Open titles, and has brought on former rival Andy Murray as his coach for the tournament.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s strange for me to share all these kinds of insights about how I feel on the court, some of the secrets of what I\u2019m going through, what I\u2019m thinking about, how I see my game, with somebody who has been one of my top rivals,\u201d Djokovic said.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m so glad and very thankful that he has accepted to work with me, and in Australia \u2026 he\u2019s very meticulous, dedicated, and professional.\u201d",

      "On the scoreboard, Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders went out with a whimper at Colorado",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- On the scoreboard, Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders went out with a whimper at Colorado.",
      "But their lasting impact in Boulder \u2014 both on the field and off \u2014 was probably immeasurable.",
      "With two dynamic stars playing their final college game, the 20th-ranked Buffaloes were blown out 36-14 by No. 17 BYU in the Alamo Bowl on Saturday night.",
      "Hunter, the Heisman Trophy winner and two-way sensation, caught four passes for a game-high 106 yards and a touchdown. His 43-yard scoring grab from Sanders cut Colorado's deficit to 27-7 with 6:14 left in the third quarter.",
      "The lockdown cornerback also made four solo tackles.",
      "Sanders, the son of Colorado coach Deion Sanders, was 16-of-23 passing for 208 yards with two TDs and two interceptions.",
      "Hunter and Shedeur Sanders are both expected to be picked high in the NFL draft next spring.",
      "Nothing's been the same at Colorado since the school hired Deion Sanders as head coach in December 2022 \u2014 and that was the idea.",
      "Along with the hype and hoopla surrounding the arrival of Coach Prime from Jackson State, the former NFL superstar brought a talented group of transfers to the Rocky Mountains \u2014 most notably his quarterback son and Hunter. Together, they helped transform the Buffaloes (9-4) from a national afterthought to one of college football's greatest shows and hottest tickets.",
      "And while Hunter and Shedeur Sanders certainly didn't have the send-off they were hoping for, the Buffaloes are still excited about a bright future.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t look forward to it, but I do because that means they are going to another level, another chapter of life, and they\u2019re going to soar,\u201d Deion Sanders said before the game. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that I feel we\u2019ve equipped them with all the tools necessary to be successful.\u201d",

      "Doug Christie doesn\u2019t plan on making sweeping changes in his new position as interim coach of the Sacramento Kings",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Doug Christie doesn\u2019t plan on making sweeping changes in his new position as interim coach of the Sacramento Kings.",
      "After a whirlwind 24 hours following the firing of Mike Brown, Christie hopes to try to galvanize the reeling Kings, who have lost five straight headed into their game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cAs individuals, we\u2019re five pieces, but when we come together, we\u2019re a fist,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I want them to understand.\u201d",
      "Christie said he has not spoken to Brown since his dismissal, which has sparked pointed criticism from other head coaches around the NBA. Christie tried to walk a fine line between professing his respect and appreciation for Brown with his admiration for the Kings, where he played five of his 15 seasons in the NBA before becoming a broadcaster for the team and then an assistant coach for the past four years. He spent five games as the interim coach in December 2021, going 2-3 while Brown was ill.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost for me, like, I got a massive amount of love for Mike, the fact that he kept me,\u201d Christie said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to learn so much from an incredible coach, develop and continue to develop and continue to learn. It\u2019s truly been a blessing for me.",
      "\u201cI think all you guys know, especially in this building, how I feel about this organization, and the love and respect and appreciation that I have for them, and all the things that have transpired from when I first started to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Christie\u2019s main challenge will be trying to address the Kings\u2019 struggles in close games. Sacramento is 3-11 in games decided by five points or less, culminating in a 114-113 loss to Detroit on Thursday.",
      "Franchise player De\u2019Aaron Fox has seen his effectiveness in late-game situations drop off considerably after pushing the team to winning records the previous two seasons under Brown. DeMar DeRozan has also struggled in those instances being acquired from Chicago in a trade in July.",
      "\u201cSometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd especially with those two, I know that they\u2019re prepared, so we put them in position and let them do what they do.\u201d",
      "Having started his career with the Lakers in 1992 and playing two seasons with them before becoming a central figure in the intense rivalry with the Kings in the early 2000s as a star for Sacramento, the significance of kicking off this coaching stint in Los Angeles wasn\u2019t lost on Christie.",
      "\u201cI mean, we are in Hollywood, so you couldn\u2019t write up a better script,\u201d Christie said. \u201cHow it turns out, whether it\u2019s a love story or a horror story, we don\u2019t quite know yet.\u201d",

      "East Carolina and NC State began brawling near the end of ECU's 26-21 victory in the Military Bowl",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- If you're already looking ahead to 2025 in college football, mark this season opener down: East Carolina at NC State on Aug. 30.",
      "The Pirates and Wolfpack began brawling in the final minute of East Carolina's 26-21 victory in the Military Bowl on Saturday night \u2014 and the teams won't have to wait long to see each other again. They face off to open next season.",
      "\u201cI'm embarrassed as a coach,\u201d NC State coach Dave Doeren said. \u201cI know our players are, too. That is not how people of this program, the players of this program, staff of this program, want anything to do with something like that. To me, it was a terrible response to something that happened to one of our players, and there's no excuses for it. So I apologize to ECU and their team for the way we responded.\"",
      "Emotions were understandably high for this matchup. NC State and East Carolina are about 80 miles apart, and although they don't play every season, they've been on each other's schedule plenty over the years.",
      "NC State rallied from a 20-7 deficit in the fourth quarter and led by a point when ECU's Rahjai Harris capped a spectacular day with an 86-yard touchdown run that gave the Pirates a 26-21 lead with 1:33 to play.",
      "An interception gave East Carolina the ball back with 44 seconds left, needing only to run out the clock, but after a run up the middle by Harris, the fight broke out around the hash marks closer to the ECU sideline.",
      "\u201cObviously, didn't like the last little bit of the game,\u201d Pirates coach Blake Harrell said. \u201cNo place in sports for that.\u201d",
      "East Carolina receiver Yannick Smith appeared to swipe a towel off the waist of NC State defensive back Tamarcus Cooley, who then chased Smith toward the sideline and pushed him to the ground. Two other ECU players came to Smith's defense. As the fight spread, it took roughly a full minute to bring the situation under control \u2014 and around eight minutes before the ball could be snapped again for a final kneel-down.",
      "At least one official appeared to have his face bloodied after the fight, and the referee seemed to be reading off a slip of paper when he announced the ejections of eight players.",
      "It makes sense if ECU had a bigger chip on its shoulder entering this game, given NC State's popularity in the state of North Carolina. Although afterward, Harrell seemed to have more choice words for other in-state teams as opposed to the Wolfpack.",
      "\u201cI don't think you can look at our fans and tell them it's not a rivalry. It's an hour and 15 minutes up the road,\" Harrell said. \"And there's a couple of other schools about the same distance. Maybe they should put us on their schedule as well, instead of trying to take our players. They want to call our players and take our players. Well how about put us on the schedule?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're going to be looked at like a little step-brother, that's fine,\" Harrell added. \"These guys are going to compete, they're going to take up the challenge. I know we got to go play these guys again next year, at the beginning of the year. But we're going to celebrate this one tonight.\u201d",

      "Miami of Ohio beat Colorado State in the Arizona Bowl, but Snoop Dogg was the main attraction",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Snoop Dogg climbed to top step of the bandstand and raised his arms, setting off a roar from the crowd. The marching bands fired up a version of \u201cWho Am I,\" the celebrity drum major grooving to the beat of his own tune.",
      "Forget your mayo baths, edible Pop-Tarts or even a national championship.",
      "Bowls don't get much better than Snoop Dogg directing the halftime show of the game bearing his name.",
      "\u201cWhat an amazing experience,\u201d Miami of Ohio coach Chuck Martin said.",
      "Snoop Dogg has seemed to become omnipresent the past few years through a massive entertainment empire.",
      "He's a rapper first, but also a movie and TV actor, video game character, pitchman, record company owner, vintner and Gin & Juice salesman.",
      "Snoop Dogg also has been involved in football for years; as a youth coach, guest analyst, with his own Snoop League for inner city youth in Southern California. He followed Jimmy Kimmel and Rob Gronkowski into the celebrity bowl sponsorship arena and, true to his brand, created quite a spectacle \u2014 along with NIL opportunities for the players \u2014 at the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice by Dre and Snoop.",
      "Martin's RedHawks beat Colorado State 43-17 in the game, but Snoop Dogg was the main attraction.",
      "The field at Arizona Stadium dazzled with signature Snoop sizzle, the image of a black low-rider in front of a desert scene painted in one end zone, the Snoop Dog logo in the other.",
      "Once game day rolled around, it seemed to be all Snoop all the time.",
      "Snoop Dogg caught a few passes from Miami\u2019s equipment manager during warmups and stopped by a tailgate outside for a few sips of gin & juice. He generated a huge roar walking out of the tunnel for the coin toss, decked out in a green-and-gold Arizona Bowl sweatsuit, sunglasses, gray Snoop Dogg sneakers, a black Gin & Juice hat and, of course, a bit of bling draped around his neck.",
      "Snoop Dogg shook hands with captains from both sides, flipped the coin \u2014 with a little flair - and posed for a photo with two of the officials before jogging to Colorado State\u2019s sideline, where he donned a headset to do a little play calling.",
      "Between quarters, Snoop Dogg tried to fire the T-shirt cannon \u2014 the shirts only flew a few feet so he waved it off \u2014 and stopped by to bop his head to a circle of Native American performers before heading up to the booth to join the TV broadcast.",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-day-a-week thing with me, man,\u201d Snoop Dogg said during the broadcast. \u201cI guess I\u2019m the people\u2019s champ because I love the people as much as they love me.\u201d",
      "That's for sure.",
      "Snoop Dogg went back down to the field for the halftime interview with Martin, then climbed the bandstand to lead both schools\u2019 bands, hitting the high notes in a medley of his songs. After stint in a suite, Snoop Dogg was back in the booth for the fourth quarter, a small Snoop Cam in the corner of the screen to catch his reactions during the action.",
      "Snoop saved the best for last.",
      "With Miami's players gathered around a makeshift stage, Snoop Dogg rolled out in a light green, lowrider Chevy Impala with gold rims and accents, the shiny Arizona Bowl trophy in his hand as fans screamed his name. After the ceremony, Snoop Dogg handed out gold chains to the players and took a few pictures before a wave of security helped usher him out of the stadium like the rock star he is.",
      "\"Thank you Tucson,\u201d Snoop said. \u201cThank you for welcoming me.\u201d",
      "The pleasure was all theirs.",

      "Maple Leafs: Toronto has lost three of four games without Auston Matthews in the lineup, who was out with an upper-body injury. Toronto has allowed at least five goals in each of those four games, and 21 total during that span.",
      "Thompson had a hot glove hand throughout the game. Washington\u2019s goalie robbed Toronto forward William Nylander of a sure goal when Thompson dove across the crease to snatch a shot at a yawning cage out of mid-air. Nylander was Thompson\u2019s victim again in the third period when a deflected power-play shot from the point was scooped by Thompson, who was facing the back of the net.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 20:02:10 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a &ldquo;political resolution&rdquo; to the issue",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue.",
      "The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by Jan. 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the Court consider staying the Act\u2019s deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,\u201d said Trump\u2019s amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case and was written by D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice for solicitor general.",
      "The argument submitted to the court is the latest example of Trump inserting himself in national issues before he takes office. The Republican president-elect has already begun negotiating with other countries over his plans to impose tariffs, and he intervened earlier this month in a plan to fund the federal government, calling for a bipartisan plan to be rejected and sending Republicans back to the negotiating table.",
      "He has been holding meetings with foreign leaders and business officials at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida while he assembles his administration, including a meeting last week with TikTok CEO Shou Chew.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined the TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral.",
      "He said earlier this year that he still believed there were national security risks with TikTok, but that he opposed banning it.",
      "The filings Friday come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for Jan. 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. The law was was signed by President Joe Biden in April after it passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge afterwards.",
      "Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and \u201cseeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\u201d",
      "In their brief to the Supreme Court on Friday, attorneys for TikTok and its parent company ByteDance argued the federal appeals court erred in its ruling and based its decision on \u201calleged \u2018risks\u2019 that China could exercise control\u201d over TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform by pressuring its foreign affiliates.",

      "An online spat between factions of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in the president-elect\u2019s political movement into public display",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An online spat between factions of Donald Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry has thrown internal divisions in his political movement into public display, previewing the fissures and contradictory views his coalition could bring to the White House.",
      "The rift laid bare the tensions between the newest flank of Trump's movement \u2014 wealthy members of the tech world including billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and their call for more highly skilled workers in their industry \u2014 and people in Trump's Make America Great Again base who championed his hardline immigration policies.",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump\u2019s selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \u201cnot America First policy\u201d and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Much of the debate played out on the social media network X, which Musk owns.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, weighed in, defending the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard-right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift. His presidential transition team did not respond to questions about positions on visas for highly skilled workers or the debate between his supporters online. Instead, his team instead sent a link to a post on X by longtime adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller that was a transcript of a speech Trump gave in 2020 at Mount Rushmore in which he praised figures and moments from American history.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who has grown remarkably close to the president-elect, was a central figure in the debate, not only for his stature in Trump's movement but his stance on the tech industry's hiring of foreign workers.",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Born in South Africa, Musk was once on an a H-1B visa himself and defended the industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "\u201cThere is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent,\" he said in a post. \u201cIt is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\u201d",
      "Trump's own positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement.",
      "His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for a mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign. He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",
      "As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump called the H-1B visa program \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d for U.S. workers. After he became president, Trump in 2017 issued a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, which directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to ensure H-1B visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.",
      "Trump's businesses, however, have hired foreign workers, including waiters and cooks at his Mar-a-Lago club, and his social media company behind his Truth Social app has used the the H-1B program for highly skilled workers.",
      "During his 2024 campaign for president, as he made immigration his signature issue, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\" and promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "But in a sharp departure from his usual alarmist message around immigration generally, Trump told a podcast this year that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cI think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" he told the \u201cAll-In\" podcast with people from the venture capital and technology world.",
      "Those comments came on the cusp of Trump's budding alliance with tech industry figures, but he did not make the idea a regular part of his campaign message or detail any plans to pursue such changes."

      "WASHINGTON -- A ninth U.S. telecoms firm has been confirmed to have been hacked as part of a sprawling Chinese espionage campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, a top White House official said Friday.",
      "Biden administration officials said this month that at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by the Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon.",

      "The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that has alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication.",
      "The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of what officials have said is a a limited number of individuals. Though the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose whose communications were accessed.",
      "Neuberger said Friday that officials did not yet have a precise sense how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but that a \u201clarge number\" were in the Washington-Virginia area.",
      "Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were \u201cgovernment targets of interest,\u201d spy on their texts and phone calls, she said.",
      "The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are \"primarily involved in government or political activity.\u201d",
      "Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. In addition, she said, the government was planning additional actions in coming weeks in response to the hacking campaign, though she did not say what they were.",
      "\u201cWe know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.",
      "The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking."

    "story": [
      "Scientists say human-caused climate change added an average of 41 days of dangerous heat worldwide in 2024",
      "People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central researchers comes at the end of a year that shattered climate record after climate record as heat across the globe made 2024 likely to be its hottest ever measured and a slew of other fatal weather events spared few.",
      "\u201cThe finding is devastating but utterly unsurprising: Climate change did play a role, and often a major role in most of the events we studied, making heat, droughts, tropical cyclones and heavy rainfall more likely and more intense across the world, destroying lives and livelihoods of millions and often uncounted numbers of people,\u201d Friederike Otto, the lead of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College climate scientist, said during a media briefing on the scientists' findings. \u201cAs long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels, this will only get worse.\u201d",
      "Millions of people endured stifling heat this year. Northern California and Death Valley baked. Sizzling daytime temperatures scorched Mexico and Central America. Heat endangered already vulnerable children in West Africa. Skyrocketing southern European temperatures forced Greece to close the Acropolis. In South and Southeast Asian countries, heat forced school closures. Earth experienced some of the hottest days ever measured and its hottest-yet summer, with a 13-month heat streak that just barely broke.",
      "To do its heat analysis, the team of volunteer international scientists compared daily temperatures around the globe in 2024 to the temperatures that would have been expected in a world without climate change. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, but researchers use peer-reviewed methods.",
      "Some areas saw 150 days or more of extreme heat due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe poorest, least developed countries on the planet are the places that are experiencing even higher numbers,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, vice president of climate science at Climate Central.",
      "What's worse, heat-related deaths are often underreported.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to die in heat waves. But if we can\u2019t communicate convincingly, \u2018but actually a lot of people are dying,\u2019 it\u2019s much harder to raise this awareness,\u201d Otto said. \u201cHeat waves are by far the deadliest extreme event, and they are the extreme events where climate change is a real game changer.\u201d",
      "This year was a warning that the planet is getting dangerously close to the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming limit compared to the pre-industrial average, according to the scientists. Earth is expected to soon edge past that threshold, although it's not considered to have been breached until that warming is sustained over decades.",
      "The researchers closely examined 29 extreme weather events this year that killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions, and found that 26 of them had clear links to climate change.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which naturally warms the Pacific Ocean and changes weather around the world, made some of this weather more likely earlier in the year. But the researchers said most of their studies found that climate change played a bigger role than that phenomenon in fueling 2024's events. Warm ocean waters and warmer air fueled more destructive storms, according to the researchers, while temperatures led to many record-breaking downpours.",
      "Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, said the science and findings were sound.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather will continue to become more frequent, intense, destructive, costly, and deadly, until we can lower the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere,\" she said.",
      "Significantly more climate extremes could be expected without action, the United Nations Environment Programme said in the fall, as more planet-warming carbon dioxide has been sent into the air this year by burning fossil fuels than last year.",
      "But the deaths and damages from extreme weather events aren't inevitable, said Julie Arrighi, director of programmes at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and part of the research.",
      "\u201cCountries can reduce those impacts by preparing for climate change and adapting for climate change, and while the challenges faced by individual countries or systems or places vary around the world, we do see that every country has a role to play,\" she said.",

      "Carter's death was also announced by the Carter Center on X, which posted \"Our founder, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia.\" The Carter Center also shared a tribute site for the late president.",
      "Carter, whose wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96, is survived by the couple's children -- John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip) and Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff); and their daughter, Amy Lynn.",
      "\"Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman, and humanitarian,\" President Biden said in a statement in reaction to Carter's death. \"With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.\"",
      "Calling him \"a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism\" and \"a great American,\" Biden said he was \"ordering an official state funeral to be held in Washington, D.C. for James Earl Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States, 76th Governor of Georgia, Lieutenant of the United States Navy, graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and favorite son of Plains, Georgia, who gave his full life in service to God and country.\"",
      "\"Hillary and I mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life,\" former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement, in part. \"Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others \u2014 until the very end ... he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Carter \"one of our most humble and devoted public servants\" who \"personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity.\"",
      "\"May his memory be a blessing and an enduring reminder of what it means to truly serve,\" Schumer's statement concluded.",
      "\u201cPresident Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, in part. \"As Jimmy Carter is reunited with his beloved Rosalynn, our thoughts and prayers are with their children, Jack, Chip, Jeff, and Amy, their grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and the millions of Americans whose lives were touched by his service.\"",
      "\"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,\" President-elect Donald Trump said in a statement, adding that he and wife Melania urged everyone to keep Carter's family \"in their hearts and prayers.\"",
      "Carter had endured several health challenges in recent years. In 2019, he underwent surgery after breaking his hip in a fall. Four years earlier, Carter was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma that had spread to his brain, though just months later, he announced that he no longer needed treatment due to a new type of cancer therapy he'd been receiving.",
      "In February of 2023, the Carter Center, the organization founded by the former president to promote human rights worldwide, announced that Carter, with \"the full support of his family and his medical team,\" would begin receiving hospice care at home.",
      "\"After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention,\" the Carter Center said in a statement.",
      "Carter attended the public memorial service for his late wife on Nov. 28, 2023, some nine months after the announcement that he'd entered hospice care. Frail and in a wheelchair, he didn't speak at the memorial. Instead, his daughter, Amy, spoke on his behalf, reading from a letter Carter sent to Rosalynn some 75 years earlier, when he was away serving in the Navy.",
      "\"My darling, every time I have ever been away from you, I have been thrilled when I returned to discover just how wonderful you are,\" the letter read, in part. \"While I am away, I try to convince myself that you really are not, could not be, as sweet and beautiful as I remember. But when I see you, I fall in love with you all over again.\"",
      "Carter turned 100 years old on Oct. 1, 2024, an occasion that was celebrated with events both at the Carter Center in Atlanta, and in Carter's Plains, Georgia hometown, though Carter himself was by that time too frail to attend them. Just 16 days later, the Carter Center announced that the former president had cast his ballot by mail in the presidential election. Carter's grandson, Jason, previously told ABC News that his grandfather would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The son of a Georgia peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter first appeared on the national political scene in 1976 with a toothy grin and the simple words that would become his trademark: \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"",
      "Among his administration's most notable achievements were the Camp David Accords, which Carter brokered between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978, and that led to the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty the following year. Carter's time in office also saw the first efforts toward developing a U.S. policy for energy independence.",
      "However, the Iran hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held hostage in Iran for a total 444 days, beginning Nov. 4, 1979, battered Carter's 1980 reelection campaign. He won just six states and the District of Columbia, for a total of 49 electoral votes compared to Republican challenger Ronald Reagan's 489 electoral votes. Reagan also defeated Carter by more than eight million ballots in the popular vote.",
      "Though political pundits of the era predicted he would be remembered as an average, one-term president, it's often been observed that Carter's reputation became more distinguished after he left the White House. He continued to champion international human rights and peace efforts, prompting Time magazine to declare in 1989, just eight years after the end of his presidency, that Carter \"may be the best former president America has ever had.\"",
      "Carter \"redefined the meaning and purpose of the modern ex-presidency,\" Time wrote. \"While Reagan peddles his time and talents to the highest bidder and Gerald Ford perfects his putt, Carter, like some jazzed superhero, circles the globe at 30,000 feet, seeking opportunities to Do Good.\"",
      "Carter was the third U.S. president, following Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which he received in 2002 after creating the Carter Center. Barack Obama became the fourth, in 2009. In selecting Carter for the honor, the Nobel Committee cited \"his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.\"",
      "James Earl Carter Jr. was born in Plains, Georgia, on Oct. 1, 1924, to James Earl Carter Sr., a peanut farmer and businessman, and Lillian Gordy Carter, a registered nurse who famously became known as 'Miss Lillian.' Though he was the first American president born in a hospital, Carter was raised in a farmhouse without indoor plumbing or electricity.",
      "Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1946 and after spending seven years as an officer -- he volunteered for submarine duty and was honorably discharged in 1953 -- he returned to farming. He began his political career in 1962 when he was elected to the first of two terms as a state senator in Georgia. During his tenure, he promised to read every bill that came to a vote, even taking a speed-reading class to keep up.",
      "After an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1966, Carter fell into a spiritual crisis, emerging as a born-again Christian. He later recalled this period as one that changed his life dramatically, saying on the campaign trail: \"Since then, I've had an inner peace and inner conviction and assurance that transformed my life for the better.\"",
      "Armed with this renewed energy, Carter launched an aggressive gubernatorial campaign and won the office in 1970.",
      "Carter announced his bid for the presidency in December 1974 as his term as governor of Georgia was ending. A relative unknown, Carter won early victories in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. He became more well-known as he steadily picked up delegates and beat back challenges from Rep. Morris 'Mo' Udall and U.S. Sen. Henry M. Jackson to secure the nomination.",
      "The deeply religious candidate caused controversy late in his campaign when he told an interviewer from Playboy magazine, \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\" While there was considerable criticism of that line and some of the other language Carter used in the interview, then-U.S. Rep. Andrew Young, whom Carter later appointed as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Carter had \"taken care of his religion problem once and for all.\"",
      "In November 1976, Carter defeated President Gerald Ford with 297 electoral votes to Ford's 241 to become the 39th president.",
      "From the moment of his inauguration, Carter set a different tone in Washington. He avoided formality, taking the oath of office as 'Jimmy' instead of 'James Earl' Carter. He and the first lady even walked the mile-and-a-half inaugural parade route to the White House, rather than ride in a limousine.",
      "Once in the Oval Office, Carter continued to bring a common touch to the presidency. He discontinued limousine service for presidential staff and even personally controlled the schedule of the White House tennis courts. As America weathered an energy crisis, Carter ordered his staff to turn the White House thermostats down in the winter and up in the summer, an energy-conscious practice he continued throughout his public career.",
      "Carter struggled with domestic policies, fighting near-record highs in inflation and unemployment. Among his few victories was the establishment of the Department of Education and the Department of Energy, the latter in response to a continued energy shortage at the time.",
      "Yet, while his domestic policies drew criticism, Carter found widespread success in foreign affairs. His administration attracted worldwide praise for distinguishing itself with a firm commitment to international human rights. Unlike his predecessors, Carter did not hesitate to criticize repressive right-wing regimes, saying in a 1977 commencement speech at Notre Dame, \"Because we know that democracy works, we can reject the arguments of those rulers who deny human rights to their people.\"",
      "The largest stain on Carter's foreign policy record came in November 1979, when a group of Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 American citizens. The militants demanded the return to Iran of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from the U.S., where he was seeking medical attention, to stand trial.",
      "Carter initially responded to the crisis by cutting diplomatic ties with Iran and blocking imports from the country. But when those measures failed, in April 1980, he ordered a secret armed rescue mission. It ended in disaster when several American helicopters malfunctioned and two aircraft collided, killing eight U.S. servicemen.",
      "The hostages were freed Jan. 20, 1980, after 444 days in captivity. Perhaps as a final insult to Carter, Iran released the hostages just minutes after President Ronald Reagan had been sworn in. The new president sent Carter to Germany to greet the hostages.",
      "It wasn't until years after he left the White House that many came to appreciate Carter. The former president embarked on a new phase of his career in public service, devoting his days to peacemaking and humanitarian efforts.",
      "\"He has made the post-presidency an institution that it had never been before,\" said historian and author Steve Hochman, who helped establish the Carter Center. \"He has been the most successful, most influential former president in American history.\"",
      "Among the organization's many efforts, the Carter Center helped spearhead a successful campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease, a debilitating parasitic infection spread by drinking water contaminated with the worm's larvae. In 1986, the disease affected 3.5 million people per year in 21 African countries, but by 2017, it had been reduced by 99.99%, to just 30 cases, according to the Carter Center.",
      "Carter told ABC News in 2015 that his goal was to eradicate the disease entirely. \"I think this is going to be a great achievement for -- not for me -- but for the people that have been afflicted and for the entire world to see diseases like this eradicated,\" Carter said.",
      "Carter also became the highest-profile supporter of Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit devoted to creating affordable housing. The Carters personally helped to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes in 14 countries, according to the organization, which also called Carter and wife Rosalynn \"two of the world's most distinguished humanitarians.\"",
      "In addition to his extensive humanitarian work, Carter wrote more than two dozen books after leaving the White House, including \"Keeping the Faith: Memoirs of a President\" (1982), \"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of My Rural Boyhood\" (2001), \"The Personal Beliefs of Jimmy Carter\" (2002), and \"Faith: A Journey for All,\" (2018). He also wrote poetry collections, as well as a fictional work about the Revolutionary War, titled \"The Hornet's Nest\" (2003).",
      "Carter referenced his Christian faith in the opening lines of his presidential inaugural address on Jan. 20, 1977, quoting the biblical Old Testament call \"to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\"",
      "Carter's faith and seemingly limitless energy manifested themselves as he taught at his church's Sunday school in his Plains, Georgia hometown, where congregants lined up to attend. He was also known for walking the length of every plane on which he traveled \u2013 he always flew commercial \u2013 to shake hands with every passenger.",
      "Yet behind Carter's easygoing Southern manner was an iron will and inexhaustible determination. Biographer Douglas Brinkley recalled the 39th president as \"a kind of military man\" who never seemed to get tired.",
      "\"I mean,\" Brinkley noted, \"the Secret Service nickname for him was 'Dasher' because he could move around so much.\"",
      "Jimmy Carter's commitment to the principles that defined his life was, again, expressed in his presidential inaugural address: \"Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved,\" Carter declared. \"The powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.\"",

      "The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered, officials said.",
      "All 181 passengers and crew aboard a passenger jet that crashed upon landing in South Korea on Sunday morning are presumed dead except for two people rescued from the wreckage, authorities said.",
      "The two survivors have been described as a male crew member from the flight, who is receiving care for non-life-threatening injuries in an intensive care unit, and a female crew member who is recovering with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Health Ministry officials on Sunday evening.",
      "Jeju Air Flight 2216 was landing at Muan International Airport around 9 a.m. local time when the plane went off the runway and crashed into a wall.",
      "There were a total of 175 passengers and six crew members aboard the Boeing 737 aircraft, which had taken off from Bangkok, according to the Korean Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport. The official death toll, provided by the National Fire Agency, was at first conservative but climbed steadily in the hours after the crash.",
      "Authorities explained that they are attempting to speed up the identification process for the victims. Although 141 out of 179 people have been identified through fingerprint identification and DNA control, 38 have not yet been identified.",
      "In some cases, the bodies are so badly damaged that fingerprints cannot be sensed. Additionally, there are not records available by which to compare fingerprints for minors, which means that familial DNA comparison is necessary.",
      "The transport ministry was on the scene investigating the cause of the crash, and details of what happened were beginning to come into focus. Prior to the plane's crash landing, the control tower issued a warning of a possible bird strike, the ministry said. About a minute after that warning, a pilot sent a mayday distress signal, after which the tower issued permission for the aircraft to land, the ministry said.",
      "According to the Air and Railway Investigation Committee, the aircraft's \"black boxes\" were recovered from the wreckage. The plane's flight data recorder was found partially damaged and its cockpit voice recorder was collected intact, officials said.",
      "Decrypting the FDR data could take about a month, according to officials. However, if the damage to the FDR is severe, it may have to be sent to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for decoding, which could take more than six months, officials said.",
      "Video from the scene at the time of the crash appears to show the landing gear was up when the plane touched down, possibly indicating some sort of malfunction, and it also appears the plane landed at a high speed. Videos taken at the scene showed flames and a thick column of dark smoke at the crash site.",
      "As of 1 p.m. local time, authorities said the plane had completely burned. A temporary morgue was being set up at the airport.",
      "By about 8 p.m., the official death toll had climbed to 176 people, the National Fire Agency said. Eighty-three of the dead were women and 82 were men, the agency said, adding that another 11 bodies remained unidentified. According to the flight manifest, there were five children under 10 years old on the flight, the youngest of them 3 years old.",
      "Initially, there were conflicting reports on the number of people rescued.",
      "United States President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday afternoon that he and first lady Jill Biden were \"deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life\" in the crash.",

      "\"We deeply apologize to all those affected by the incident at Muan Airport,\" Jeju Air said in a notice posted in English on its website. \"We will make every effort to resolve the situation. We sincerely regret the distress caused.\"",

      "Former President Jimmy Carter, who died at age 100 on Sunday in Plains, Georgia, had endured several health challenges in recent years.",
      "In 2019, he underwent surgery after breaking his hip in a fall. Four years earlier, Carter was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma that had spread to his brain, though just months later, he announced that he no longer needed treatment due to a new type of cancer therapy he'd been receiving.",
      "In February of 2023, the Carter Center, the organization founded by the former president to promote human rights worldwide, announced that Carter, with \"the full support of his family and his medical team,\" would begin receiving hospice care at home.",

      "Here are some of the recent health challenges that Carter faced before his death on Dec. 29.",
      "Surgery on his liver",
      "Carter underwent elective surgery on Aug. 2, 2015, at Emory University Hospital to remove a small mass in his liver, the Carter Center announced at the time.",
      "While the surgery was successful and doctors said he would make a full recovery, the surgery revealed further health challenges for the former president.",

      "\"I will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare,\" he said in a statement through his organization.",

      "Doctors discovered that Carter had melanoma, one of the most common cancers affecting men and women in the U.S. and the most dangerous form of skin cancer.",
      "Melanoma has a very high risk of metastasizing throughout the bloodstream or lymphatic system and to other body parts.",
      "The 39th president said at an Aug. 20, 2015 press conference, that an MRI of his head and neck revealed that the cancer had spread to four different parts of his brain.",
      "Carter, who was 90 years old at the time, said that when he discovered that the cancer had spread, he thought he didn't have much time left, which didn't alarm him.",
      "\"I just thought I had a few weeks left, but I was surprisingly at ease,\" Carter said. \"I've had a wonderful life. I have thousands of friends\u2026so I was surprisingly at ease, much more so than my wife was.\"",
      "At the press conference, Carter said that despite the ease of knowing he lived a full life, he would follow his doctors' recommendation to ensure he \"extends\" his life as long as he can.",
      "He underwent surgery, radiation therapy and cancer treatment called immunotherapy to fight the disease.",
      "Carter received treatments between August 2015 through February 2016.",
      "In December 2015, responding well to treatment, Carter said MRI scans showed that there were no longer any signs of spots of melanoma on his brain, nor did any new ones develop.",
      "The former president announced to his church in March 2016, that doctors stopped his treatment after seeing no signs of tumors.",
      "According to experts, the successful treatment was likely primarily due to the drug pembrolizumab, which targets cancer by ramping up the body's immune system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment in 2011.",
      "Dehydration at Habitat for Humanity",
      "On July 13, 2017, the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize recipient was taken to the hospital for observation after becoming dehydrated while building homes in the hot sun at a Habitat for Humanity site in Winnipeg, Canada.",

      "The Grammy Award winner had hip replacement surgery at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia, on May 13, 2019.",
      "\"President Carter said his main concern is that turkey season ends this week, and he has not reached his limit,\" the Carter Foundation said. \"He hopes the State of Georgia will allow him to rollover the unused limit to next year.\"",

      "At-home hospice care",
      "On Saturday, The Carter Center announced that the former president is receiving hospice care at home, where he is expected to spend his final moments with his loved ones, rather than seek further medical treatment.",
      "\"He has the full support of his family and his medical team,\" the Carter Center said in a statement. \"The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers.\"",

      "Instead, he continued to work for years after -- a legacy that is drawing renewed attention in the wake of his death at age 100.",
      "After serving one term as president and losing his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded an eponymous organization in Georgia dedicated to conflict resolution and advancing human rights, public health and democracy around the world.",
      "The Carter Center, the main vehicle for the Carters' work, was founded in 1982, the year after he left the White House.",
      "Jimmy Carter's advocacy for peaceful resolutions to global conflicts helped burnish his reputation as a global statesman, a commitment he underscored when receiving the Nobel on Dec. 10, 2002.",
      "\"War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children,\" he said then.",

      "Since its founding, the center has established programs across the globe, focusing both on democracy promotion and public engagement with government as well as global health.",
      "Among other accomplishments, the center highlights work monitoring 113 elections across 39 countries. Specifically, the center recently observed elections in Myanmar, Bolivia, the Ivory Coast, Guyana, Tunisia and Nepal and currently runs projects to expand women's access to information in Liberia, Bangladesh and Guatemala.",
      "Elsewhere, the center is \"supporting a human rights-based approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\" working to implement a 2015 peace agreement in Mali and ameliorate the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the type of work that led to Jimmy Carter's Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.",
      "\"What I derive from this is a commitment to peace, to the honoring of international law,\" Jimmy Carter said on Oct. 11, 2002 after he was announced as the prize's winner that year.",
      "Building off of Jimmy Carter's success in the White House in establishing a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the center ultimately became a diplomatic broker outside of the government's official channels, with the former president himself meeting world leaders in places like North Korea, where in 1994 he helped establish a pact between Washington and Pyongyang on nuclear issues.",
      "Besides democracy promotion and conflict resolution, the center has also long been involved in several global health programs, including fighting Guinea worm, river blindness, trachoma, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis and malaria.",
      "\"We believe access to health care is a human right, especially among poor people afflicted with disease who are forgotten, ignored, and often without hope,\" Jimmy Carter said in a quote featured on the center's website. \"Just to know that someone cares about them not only can ease their physical pain but also remove an element of alienation and anger that can lead to hatred and violence.\"",
      "Those efforts helped lead to the unanimous decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2002 to award the peace prize to the former president.",
      "At the time, he lamented the growing global wealth disparity, linking it to many of the world's greatest challenges.",
      "\"Among all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now seventy-five times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them,\" he said in 2002.",
      "\"The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world's unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict, and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS.\"",
      "Besides working through his center, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter worked for decades with Habitat for Humanity, often volunteering themselves to help build homes for those in need.",

      "Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, had been \"been champions and groundbreaking voices for affordable, decent housing for all\" since 1984, according to Habitat for Humanity. The Carters donated their time and influence and worked with nearly 103,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,331 homes, the nonprofit stated.",
      "Rhode Island-based builder and designer Kenneth Young, 66, first began volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in the 1990s. After his first \"Carter build\" in 1995 in Watts, California, a neighborhood in southern Los Angeles, he \"got the bug,\" he told ABC News.",

      "\"It was classic,\" Young said.",
      "Don Shaw and Thomas Trumble -- lifelong friends who have been volunteering together for decades with the Habitat for Humanity chapter in Hartford, Connecticut, first worked with Carter in 2002 during a build in Durban, South Africa, they told ABC News.",

      "\"Our allies don't know whether we are reliable partners or not,\" said Cardin, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of this term.",
      "Cardin's comments came after Trump recently criticized as \"ridiculous\" and \"highly unfair\" the fees Panama charges American shipping companies to use the vital link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He said the shipping fees were a \"complete ripoff of our country\" and vowed to put an end to them once he takes office, or he will demand that Panama cede control of the canal to the United States.",

      "Cardin noted on \"This Week\" that the obligations of the U.S. and Panama were established by the Panama Canal and Neutrality Treaty of 1977 and ratified by Congress.",
      "\"I don't know what the president-elect is saying in regards to how sincere he is, but I can tell you, it does raise questions globally as to whether we're a reliable partner,\" Cardin said. \"And it really feeds into Russia and China appeal to other countries as to whether they need to make alliances with -- with Russia and China, whether America will be there for them globally.\"",
      "Pressed by Karl on other statements Trump has recently made, including buying Greenland from the Danish government and making Canada the 51st U.S. state -- even mocking Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"Governor\" -- Cardin said such talk is not helpful.",
      "\"Globally, we saw the same type of statements made during his previous administration, when he threatened to pull out of NATO,\" Cardin said of Trump. \"These are treaty obligations which our allies rely upon, and it raises serious concerns about whether America will be there for them.\"",
      "Asked by Karl about Ukraine's future during a second Trump administration, Cardin said that while there continues to be bipartisan support in Congress, he described Trump's comments on Ukraine as \"very disturbing.\"",
      "Trump recently suggested that he may reverse President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory, calling the decision \"stupid.\"",
      "Cardin said Ukraine is the \"front line of defense for democracy.\"",
      "\"We know that Russia will not stop with Ukraine. We know many other countries feel at risk if Ukraine is not able to defend its sovereignty... I know some of the president-elect's comments are very disturbing. I've talked to the Ukrainians. I've talked to the Europeans several times, I think they question whether America's resolve will be there,\" he said. \"I can tell you we have bipartisan support in the United States Congress to stand with Ukraine because we recognize the importance to our national security.\"",

      "Two weeks before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over TikTok's future, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to delay a Jan. 19 deadline for the app to be sold to a new owner or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "An amicus brief filed by Trump's nominee to be solicitor general, John Sauer, is asking the court to grant a stay delaying the deadline so that the incoming president can work out a \"negotiated resolution\" that would save the app.",
      "The filing casts Trump as someone who \"alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government.\"",
      "Trump's brief says he \"opposes banning TikTok in the United States at this juncture,\" but does not express the view that the law requiring the sale violates the First Amendment, saying he takes no position on the merits of the case.",
      "Instead, the filing from Sauer asks the court to put the deadline on pause to allow Trump's incoming administration \"to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "TikTok, which has over 170 million U.S. users, has sued over the law requiring it to be sold by its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance by Jan. 19 or be banned in the U.S.",

      "Trump originally tried to ban TikTok in his first term, but has since reversed course, vowing during the 2024 presidential campaign to \"save\" the app.",
      "In Trump\u2019s amicus brief, Sauer raised the idea of social media censorship, invoking Brazil\u2019s recent month-long ban of social media platform X, the treatment of the Hunter Biden laptop story and government efforts to stamp out COVID-19 misinformation as incidents that should give the justices pause.",
      "\u201cThis Court should be deeply concerned about setting a precedent that could create a slippery slope toward global government censorship of social media speech,\u201d Sauer wrote in the filing. \u201cThe power of a Western government to ban an entire social-media platform with more than 100 million users, at the very least, should be considered and exercised with the most extreme care\u2014not reviewed on a \u2018highly expedited basis.\u2019\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:29:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans made claims about noncitizens voting a centerpiece of 2024 campaign.",

      "Republicans made claims about noncitizens voting a centerpiece of 2024 campaign.",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Republicans made claims about illegal voting by noncitizens a centerpiece of their 2024 campaign messaging and plan to push legislation in the new Congress requiring voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. Yet there's one place with a GOP supermajority where linking voting to citizenship appears to be a nonstarter: Kansas.",
      "That's because the state has been there, done that, and all but a few Republicans would prefer not to go there again. Kansas imposed a proof-of-citizenship requirement over a decade ago that grew into one of the biggest political fiascos in the state in recent memory.",
      "The law, passed by the state Legislature in 2011 and implemented two years later, ended up blocking the voter registrations of more than 31,000 U.S. citizens who were otherwise eligible to vote. That was 12% of everyone seeking to register in Kansas for the first time. Federal courts ultimately declared the law an unconstitutional burden on voting rights, and it hasn't been enforced since 2018.",
      "Kansas provides a cautionary tale about how pursuing an election concern that in fact is extremely rare risks disenfranchising a far greater number of people who are legally entitled to vote. The state\u2019s top elections official, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, championed the idea as a legislator and now says states and the federal government shouldn't touch it.",
      "\u201cKansas did that 10 years ago,\u201d said Schwab, a Republican. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out so well.\u201d",
      "Steven Fish, a 45-year-old warehouse worker in eastern Kansas, said he understands the motivation behind the law. In his thinking, the state was like a store owner who fears getting robbed and installs locks. But in 2014, after the birth of his now 11-year-old son inspired him to be \u201ca little more responsible\u201d and follow politics, he didn\u2019t have an acceptable copy of his birth certificate to get registered to vote in Kansas.",
      "\u201cThe locks didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Fish, one of nine Kansas residents who sued the state over the law. \u201cYou caught a bunch of people who didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d",
      "Kansas' experience appeared to receive little if any attention outside the state as Republicans elsewhere pursued proof-of-citizenship requirements this year.",
      "Arizona enacted a requirement this year, applying it to voting for state and local elections but not for Congress or president. The Republican-led U.S. House passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement in the summer and plans to bring back similar legislation after the GOP won control of the Senate in November.",
      "In Ohio, the Republican secretary of state revised the form that poll workers use for voter eligibility challenges to require those not born in the U.S. to show naturalization papers to cast a regular ballot. A federal judge declined to block the practice days before the election.",
      "Also, sizable majorities of voters in Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and the presidential swing states of North Carolina and Wisconsin were inspired to amend their state constitutions' provisions on voting even though the changes were only symbolic. Provisions that previously declared that all U.S. citizens could vote now say that only U.S. citizens can vote \u2014 a meaningless distinction with no practical effect on who is eligible.",
      "To be clear, voters already must attest to being U.S. citizens when they register to vote and noncitizens can face fines, prison and deportation if they lie and are caught.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing unconstitutional about ensuring that only American citizens can vote in American elections,\u201d U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, of Texas, the leading sponsor of the congressional proposal, said in an email statement to The Associated Press.",
      "After Kansas residents challenged their state's law, both a federal judge and federal appeals court concluded that it violated a law limiting states to collecting only the minimum information needed to determine whether someone is eligible to vote. That's an issue Congress could resolve.",
      "The courts ruled that with \u201cscant\u201d evidence of an actual problem, Kansas couldn't justify a law that kept hundreds of eligible citizens from registering for every noncitizen who was improperly registered. A federal judge concluded that the state\u2019s evidence showed that only 39 noncitizens had registered to vote from 1999 through 2012 \u2014 an average of just three a year.",
      "In 2013, then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican who had built a national reputation advocating tough immigration laws, described the possibility of voting by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally as a serious threat. He was elected attorney general in 2022 and still strongly backs the idea, arguing that federal court rulings in the Kansas case \u201calmost certainly got it wrong.\u201d",
      "Kobach also said a key issue in the legal challenge \u2014 people being unable to fix problems with their registrations within a 90-day window \u2014 has probably been solved.",
      "\u201cThe technological challenge of how quickly can you verify someone\u2019s citizenship is getting easier,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cAs time goes on, it will get even easier.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the Kansas case in 2020. But in August, it split 5-4 in allowing Arizona to continue enforcing its law for voting in state and local elections while a legal challenge goes forward.",
      "Seeing the possibility of a different Supreme Court decision in the future, U.S. Rep.-elect Derek Schmidt says states and Congress should pursue proof-of-citizenship requirements. Schmidt was the Kansas attorney general when his state's law was challenged.",
      "\"If the same matter arose now and was litigated, the facts would be different,\" he said in an interview.",
      "But voting rights advocates dismiss the idea that a legal challenge would turn out differently. Mark Johnson, one of the attorneys who fought the Kansas law, said opponents now have a template for a successful court fight.",
      "\u201cWe know the people we can call,\" Johnson said. \u201cWe know that we\u2019ve got the expert witnesses. We know how to try things like this.\u201d He predicted \"a flurry \u2014 a landslide \u2014 of litigation against this.\u201d",
      "Initially, the Kansas requirement's impacts seemed to fall most heavily on politically unaffiliated and young voters. As of fall 2013, 57% of the voters blocked from registering were unaffiliated and 40% were under 30.",
      "But Fish was in his mid-30s, and six of the nine residents who sued over the Kansas law were 35 or older. Three even produced citizenship documents and still didn\u2019t get registered, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single one of us that was actually an illegal or had misinterpreted or misrepresented any information or had done anything wrong,\u201d Fish said.",
      "He was supposed to produce his birth certificate when he sought to register in 2014 while renewing his Kansas driver's license at an office in a strip mall in Lawrence. A clerk wouldn't accept the copy Fish had of his birth certificate. He still doesn't know where to find the original, having been born on an Air Force base in Illinois that closed in the 1990s.",
      "Several of the people joining Fish in the lawsuit were veterans, all born in the U.S., and Fish said he was stunned that they could be prevented from registering.",
      "Liz Azore, a senior adviser to the nonpartisan Voting Rights Lab, said millions of Americans haven't traveled outside the U.S. and don't have passports that might act as proof of citizenship, or don't have ready access to their birth certificates.",
      "She and other voting rights advocates are skeptical that there are administrative fixes that will make a proof-of-citizenship law run more smoothly today than it did in Kansas a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to cover a lot of people from all walks of life,\u201d Avore said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be disenfranchising large swaths of the country.\u201d",

      "Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.",
      "A norovirus infection is characterized by sudden vomiting and diarrhea. Outbreaks are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like nursing homes and jails, as well as schools and places where people are close together.",
      "Here are a few things to know about the virus.",
      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",
      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body ache, headache and fever.",
      "Most norovirus outbreaks occur when people who are already infected spread the virus to others by direct means, such as through sharing food or eating utensils. Outbreaks can also be spread through food, water or contaminated surfaces .",
      "Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.",
      "But with 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the United States, norovirus nevertheless causes on average 900 deaths and 109,000 hospitalizations annually, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. It also leads to 465,000 emergency department visits, mostly involving young children.",
      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help."

Mitchell and the conspiring officer both admitted to investigators that they planned to physically punish the inmate as disciplinary action, authorities said.",

Its ladder was ripped off and in the grass several yards away, The Sun-Sentinel reported.",

      "ROSEVILLE, Minn. -- Republicans will start the year with at least a temporary majority in the Minnesota House after a Democrat decided not to appeal a judge's decision that he failed to establish residency in the suburban district he was elected to represent.",
      "That means Republicans will have a slim 67-66 majority in the House when the Legislature begins Jan. 14. That may not last long because Gov. Tim Walz has already scheduled a Jan. 28 special election in the Democratic-leaning district that Curtis Johnson won by 30 points in November.",
      "\u201cWhile I disagree with the conclusions reached by the District Court, I recognize that whatever the decision on appeal the ultimate decision belongs to the Legislature, where it appears there is no viable pathway for me being allowed to retain my seat,\u201d Johnson said in his resignation letter Friday. \u201cRather than dragging this out further, I have decided to resign now, so that a special election can be held as soon as possible.\u201d",

The St. Paul Pioneer Press reported that the lack of utility hookups and regular activity at the apartment reinforced that conclusion.",
      "Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth, who is in line to become House speaker with the GOP in control, said she is pleased the judge's decision will stand. Previously, leaders of both parties had been working out a power-sharing agreement given that the chamber was expected to be divided equally 67-67.",

      "Although Democrats argue that Republicans would need to have at least 68 seats to control the House. or pass laws.",
      "The Democrats should be able to stop Republicans from being able to pass laws, but the GOP could still push its agenda. Republicans will have working control of committees to advance bills to the floor, which could force Democrats from swing districts to face tough decisions on bills. And Republicans could try to launch investigations they have been seeking for a long time into the Walz administration and problems it has had limiting fraud.",
      "Democrats had been expecting to have a one-vote edge in the Senate, but that chamber is now evenly split at 33-33 after former Majority Leader Sen. Kari Dziedzic died Friday from cancer. A special election will also be held for her Democratic-leaning Minneapolis district, but that hasn't been scheduled yet.",
      "Demuth also questioned whether Walz has the power to set the special election so quickly even before the Legislature certifies the vacancy. If that argument prevails that would extend Republican control of the House longer, but the secretary of state's office told Minnesota Public Radio that Walz's order setting the special election is proper.",
      "Whenever the election happens, Democrats are confident they will win the seat, current House speaker Rep. Melissa Hortman said.",
      "\u201cA prompt special election will allow the voters of District 40B to ensure that they will be represented in the Minnesota House for the bulk of the session,\u201d Hortman said in a written statement. \u201cWe expect the district will again vote to elect a Democrat by overwhelming margins.\u201d",
      "A pending court challenge in a different suburban district could also affect the balance of power in the House, but it appears Democrats will likely prevail in that dispute. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, of Shakopee, was declared the winner by 14 votes over Republican Aaron Paul despite 20 missing ballots that were accepted but never counted and then apparently thrown away. At a hearing, his attorneys presented six of those affected voters who testified that they supported Tabke, which would be enough to preserve his win. A judge is expected to decide within the next few weeks how to proceed."

      "NEW YORK -- If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.",
      "A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older over the last few years, it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t make it to midnight, it\u2019s not a big deal, you know?\u201d says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.",
      "Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member\u2019s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.",
      "But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way \u2014 by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.",
      "There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don\u2019t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.",
      "Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.",
      "\u201cA majority of who I\u2019ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do because they haven\u2019t found anything or things are just really expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cParty packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.\u201d",
      "As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event \u2014 about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults \u2014 60 and above \u2014 say they won\u2019t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.",
      "Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do anything too crazy for New Year\u2019s, usually. So this is definitely a change,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.\u201d",
      "Woods will be working New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.",
      "\u201cHolidays are really hard for people, so I don\u2019t mind working,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.\u201d",
      "Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year\u2019s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board \u2014 about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.",
      "Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care \u2014 more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good year to focus on mental health,\u201d he said.",
      "Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.",
      "Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: \u201cProbably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week \u2014 get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That\u2019s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.\u201d",
      "Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. \u201cMental health is the new one, but I think it\u2019s high up there as well as with regular health,\u201d she said.",
      "She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really a resolution, but that\u2019s a goal that I\u2019m setting.\u201d",
      "And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.",
      "This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. \u201cHockey\u2019s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,\u201d she said.",

      "At least one Mega Millions player has plenty of dough to ring in the New Year after drawing the winning number. After three months without anyone winning the top prize in the lottery, a ticket worth an estimated $1.22 billion was sold in California for the drawing Friday night, according to the Mega Millions website.",
      "The California Lottery said the winning ticket was sold at Circle K (Sunshine Food and Gas) on Rhonda Road in Cottonwood, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Sacramento. The winning ticket matched the white balls 3, 7, 37, 49, 55 and the gold Mega Ball 6.

      "The total amount of the Mega Millions jackpot would only be distributed to a winner who chooses an annuity paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt to take a cash payout, which for Friday night\u2019s drawing is an estimated $549.7 million.",
      "Despite the game\u2019s long odds of 1 in 302.6 million, players continued to purchase tickets as the size of the grand prize grew. Until Friday, the last time a Mega Millions player hit the top prize was Sept. 10.",
      "The largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot ticket worth $1.6 billion was sold in Florida in August 2023. Two prizes for its compatriot Powerball lottery have been larger.",
      "Mega Millions and Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico.",
      "Mega Millions ticket prices are set to rise from $2 to $5 in April. The increase will be one of many changes that officials say will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts."

      "A California appeals court has overturned the rape conviction of former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A California appeals court has overturned the rape conviction of former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield after determining prosecutors made racially discriminatory statements during the Black man's trial.",
      "The retired football player was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in October 2020 after being convicted of raping a developmentally disabled woman in 2015 who prosecutors said he lured to his home with the promise of a babysitting job.",
      "The Sixth Court of Appeals found Wednesday that prosecutors violated the California Racial Justice Act of 2020, a law passed during a summer of protest over the police killing of George Floyd. The measure bars prosecutors from seeking a criminal conviction or imposing a sentence on the basis of race.",
      "Prior to the law, defendants who wanted to challenge their convictions on the basis of racial bias had to prove there was \u201cpurposeful discrimination,\u201d a difficult legal standard to meet.",
      "The appeals court said prosecutors used \u201cracially discriminatory language\u201d that required them to overturn Stubblefield's conviction.",
      "The case was \u201cinfected with tremendous error from the minute we started the trial,\u201d said Stubblefield's lead attorney, Kenneth Rosenfeld.",
      "In April 2015, Stubblefield contacted the then-31-year-old woman on a babysitting website and arranged an interview, prosecutors said.",
      "According to a report by the Morgan Hill Police Department, the interview lasted about 20 minutes. She later received a text from Stubblefield saying he wanted to pay her for her time that day, and she went back to the house.",
      "The woman reported to the police that Stubblefield raped her at gunpoint, then gave her $80 and let her go. DNA evidence matched that of Stubblefield, the report said.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said police never searched Stubblefield's house and never introduced a gun into evidence, saying it was because he was famous Black man and it would \u201copen up a storm of controversy,\" according to the appellate decision.",
      "By saying Stubblefield\u2019s race was a factor in law enforcement\u2019s decision not to search his house, prosecutors implied the house would've been searched and a gun found had Stubblefield not been Black, the appeals court said. The reference to controversy also links Stubblefield to the events after the recent killing of Floyd based on his race.",
      "Defense attorneys said there was no rape, and Stubblefield said the woman consented to sex in exchange for money.",
      "\u201cThe trial had a biased judge who didn't allow the evidence from the defense, the fact that she was a sex worker, to be heard in front of a jury,\u201d Rosenfeld said. He called the incident a \u201ctransactional occasion\u201d between Stubblefield and the woman.",
      "He remains in custody until a hearing next week, during which his attorneys will ask a judge to approve a motion to release him. Prosecutors have several options, including asking the court to stay their decision so they can appeal to the state's Supreme Court, or refile charges.",
      "The Santa Clara District Attorney's Office said it was \u201cstudying the opinion.\u201d",
      "Stubblefield began his 11-year lineman career in the NFL with the 49ers in 1993 as the league\u2019s defensive rookie of the year. He later won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1997 before leaving the team to play for Washington. He returned to the Bay Area to finish his career, playing with the 49ers in 2000-01 and the Raiders in 2003."

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the chancellor and business secretary have written to the UK's main regulators asking them to come up with ideas for reform that could boost economic growth.",
      "They contacted watchdogs, including energy regulator Ofgem and water regulator Ofwat, before Christmas asking them to submit proposals by mid-January.",
      "This comes after figures published earlier this week indicated the UK economy had flatlined between July and September.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the letter \"says all you need to know\" about Sir Keir's government, claiming he has to \"beg his own government to create growth after Labour's damaging Budget\".",
      "UK economy had zero growth between July and September",
      "Get serious on pay in 2025, TUC chief tells ministers",
      "The letter - which is also understood to have been sent to the Environment Agency, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and healthcare regulators - was first reported by Sky News.",
      "Signed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, it said ministers believed collaboration to be essential to ensure the regulatory environment became \"more pro-growth and pro-investment\" while respecting the independence of regulators.",
      "The FCA said it would reply in the new year. It added that it had already delivered measures since the summer to support growth, including reforming information that retail investors receive, as well as making proposals to provide better value for money for workplace pensions.",
      "The letter said improving regulation to enable growth and not hold back investment was \"an essential part\" of the government's growth mission.",
      "Economic growth is a principal reason behind many major policy announcements, from Communities Secretary Angela Rayner unveiling reforms to the planning system in order to boost house-building, to the chancellor encouraging more \"sensible risk-taking\" in financial services companies.",
      "This letter is evidence that Sir Keir wants to pull every possible governmental lever to make sure arms-length bodies like regulators, as well as government departments, prioritise helping deliver Labour's mission of achieving the highest sustained economic growth in the G7.",
      "It is also an indication that the prime minister fears regulators can restrain economic growth by imposing obstacles to business activity \u2013 a message typically more associated with Conservative politicians but which Starmer is increasingly putting at the heart of his plans.",
      "In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said that \"the regulators, the blockers and bureaucrats\" were part of an \"alliance of naysayers\" who mean that \"we can't get things done in our country.\"",
      "And in October, addressing a summit of international investors in London, he said: \"We've got to look at regulation across the piece, and where it is needlessly holding back investment\u2026 mark my words, we will get rid of it\".",
      "On the other side of the argument will be groups in various sectors where there is a regulator, who argue that what the government sees as obstacles are in fact necessary rules.",
      "Conservative MP Griffith said that if the prime minister wants the UK to exhibit the fastest growth in the G7, then \"he'd have more luck turning the clock back to before the general election when the UK was growing under the Conservatives\".",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Keir warned MPs it would take some time for people to feel their living standards improve.",
      "This week Reeves also said the challenge was to fix the economy \"after 15 years of neglect is huge\", while shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the figures showed \"growth has tanked on Labour's watch\"."

      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "This has been a miserable year for Boeing. Not only has it struggled to cope with a safety and quality control crisis, it has lost billions of dollars following a strike by workers that paralysed production at two of its biggest factories.",
      "Even its space programme has been in trouble. Two astronauts were left stranded on the International Space Station in June after their Boeing Starliner capsule developed a potential fault, which would have made returning to Earth in it too dangerous.",
      "On top of all this, the company faces a crisis of confidence from within its own ranks, says Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical and economic analyst at industry consultants Leeham Company.",
      "\"People in Boeing don't believe in words from top management any more,\" he says.",
      "Sam Mohawk is a 51-year-old quality assurance investigator at Boeing's factory in Renton near Seattle, a huge plant where the 737 Max is built. It is the company's best-selling aircraft, but one with a chequered safety record.",
      "Earlier this year Mr Mohawk came forward as a whistleblower, claiming that chaos on the factory floor in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic had led to thousands of faulty or \"non-conforming\" parts going missing, and potentially being fitted aboard aircraft that have since been sent to customers.",
      "\"The whole system was just in shambles,\" he says of that period. \"It [had] kind of just broken down.\"",
      "His allegations came to light in June when they were referred to during a congressional hearing in Washington DC into safety failures at the aerospace giant.",
      "During the session, Boeing's top bosses were accused by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of \"strip-mining\" the company for profit and cutting corners on safety in order to boost earnings.",
      "David Calhoun, who was Boeing's chief executive at the time, said he \"didn't recognise\" Mr Hawley's depiction of the company. \"That is not the way we operate,\" Mr Calhoun said back then. \"I am proud of every action we have taken.\"",
      "Since then, Boeing has appointed a new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, who has pledged to \"restore trust\" in the business, overhaul its corporate culture and prioritise the safety of passengers. The company is also in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety and quality plan, which was launched earlier in the year.",
      "But according to Mr Mohawk, who still works at Boeing, the drive to build planes as quickly as possible in order to maximise revenues remains. The accountants, he insists, are \"100%\" running the operation.",
      "\"Nothing has changed,\" says Mr Mohawk. \"Our executives talk to the press and say, 'quality and safety is our number one priority'. But it's just the same.\"",
      "Boeing rejects Mr Mohawk's claims. It insists they have been thoroughly investigated and that none of them were found to be valid.",
      "In a statement, it said: \"Boeing data systems do track parts, including non-conforming parts. The investigations into Mr Mohawk's claims found no evidence that defective parts were installed on Boeing planes, and none of the issues raised affected safety.\"",
      "Another Boeing employee called Nathan (not his real name), who works in the company's Everett factory in Washington state, where the 777 is built, describes low staff morale and corners being cut on the production line. Employees \"don't always follow the rules because they feel the pressure from their manager, and so they are not taking steps to ensure their own safety\", he claims.",
      "But Mike Dunlop, an aerospace industry veteran and author of a book about turning around failing businesses, argues that Boeing has in fact already begun the process of transforming itself by going back to basics.",
      "He believes many of Boeing's problems result from the arrogance of the company's management in the past, as it sought to cut costs in an effort to make more money. Recently, he says, there have been some improvements.",
      "\"I've seen the biggest changes in the company since the 1960s. What Kelly Ortberg is doing is focusing back on their core principles, which is to build airplanes as effectively and safely as possible, and be a reliable supplier to the airlines.\"",
      "Arguably, the market needs Boeing to be healthy. It remains a huge company, employing more than 150,000 people directly, and countless more in supply chains around the world. It is a significant contributor to the US economy.",
      "But some insiders argue that it now has a credibility problem and needs to restore confidence.",
      "Crashes and the 737 Max",
      "Boeing's challenging year began on 5 January with a routine evening flight from Portland International Airport in Oregon to Ontario, California. The plane, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, had taken off minutes earlier and was climbing when something went badly wrong.",
      "\"Er, yeah, we'd like to go down,\" a female voice said over the radio as the crisis erupted at 16,000ft. \"Alaska 1282 declaring an emergency\u2026 we're descending to 10,000\u2026 we're depressurised.\"",
      "Moments earlier on the flight deck, First Officer Emily Wiprud had been exchanging routine messages with air traffic control, then there was a loud bang, a sudden rush of wind and her radio headset was torn off. Air pressure in the aircraft plummeted, as did the temperature.",
      "Ms Wiprud and the captain hurriedly put on oxygen masks, then worked together with calm urgency to bring the damaged aircraft to the ground.",
      "What had happened was deeply disturbing. A panel fitted over an unused emergency exit had not been bolted into place properly and had come away as the plane was climbing, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the incident.",
      "The passengers were still strapped in and no one was seriously hurt. But as investigators pointed out, it could have been much worse.",
      "What made the incident stand out was the fact that the 737 Max was Boeing's newest aircraft and its bestselling model in history.",
      "Since its entry into service, more than 1,600 have been sent to airlines and a further 4,800 are on order. But even before this, its safety record was tarnished.",
      "In late 2018, an aircraft went down in the sea off the coast of Indonesia. Four months later another plane crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. A total of 346 people were killed.",
      "Both accidents were ultimately blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software. This had been fitted to address handling quirks on the new plane, and prevent pilots, who were used to earlier versions of the 737, from needing expensive retraining.",
      "In practice, it became active at the wrong time, and forced both aircraft into catastrophic dives, according to investigators.",
      "Did cost cutting 'jeopardise safety'?",
      "Some critics blame these accidents on a focus on the bottom line at the expense of safety. In a statement, The Foundation for Aviation Safety, which is chaired by ex-Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson, said: \"Attention to share price and profit margins alone has proven to be a flawed strategy.\"",
      "In the aftermath of those crashes, the 737 Max was grounded for 20 months as regulators examined every aspect of its design.",
      "The company faced criticism over its corporate culture. A congressional report released in September 2020 found that Boeing's rush to build new aircraft as quickly as possible while cutting costs had \"jeopardised the safety of the flying public\" \u2013 although its findings were described as \"partisan\" by one leading Republican.",
      "The incident in Portland, however, was the result of the failure by Boeing engineers to bolt the door panel back on properly, after it had been removed to repair manufacturing flaws. Yet it placed the company in the spotlight again.",
      "In particular, it drew attention to a series of continuing quality problems that had been occurring behind the scenes at the aircraft-maker and at its main supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which makes a number of large aircraft components including the main body.",
      "These included manufacturing defects affecting parts of fuselages, tail and rudder assemblies, as well as sealants applied as protection against the effect of lightning strikes in central fuel tanks.",
      "But the incident also placed a renewed focus on claims made by whistleblowers from within both companies, who had suggested that the pressure from Boeing to produce aircraft quickly, and ramp up production, had compromised safety on both the 737 and 787 programmes.",
      "The sudden deaths of two other whistleblowers \u2013 John Barnett, who had worked in Boeing's 787 factory in South Carolina, and Josh Dean, who had been employed by Spirit \u2013 generated further headlines in 2024. It resulted in pushing the wider story about Boeing once again into the news.",
      "US politicians made their feelings clear. Richard Blumenthal, head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations said: \"Boeing has put profits and speed of production ahead of quality and safety, and ultimately, that failing is at the core of its current difficulties.\"",
      "The strike that 'cost Boeing $5.5 billion'",
      "After the Portland incident, Boeing was ordered by the US Department of Transportation to produce a comprehensive action plan \"to address its systemic quality control and production issues\".",
      "The aerospace giant responded by publishing a detailed strategy aimed at improving its production systems, gaining more control over its supply chain, and encouraging employees to speak up on safety and quality control issues.",
      "It also promised to strengthen its training programmes and overhaul critical processes on the production line.",
      "On 1 July, Boeing reached an agreement to take control of Spirit as part of its efforts to resolve quality problems.",
      "There were also changes at the top of the company when Mr Calhoun, who had become chief executive a year after the incidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia, stepped down and was replaced in August by Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who had spent decades in the industry.",
      "But weeks after his appointment, Boeing faced further crisis when more than 30,000 unionised workers - most of them in the company's Washington State heartlands - went on strike over a new four-year contract, and how much Boeing would increase pay and other benefits for its workers.",
      "The walkout, which began in September and lasted for seven weeks, held up production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "In the past, the company had become accustomed to negotiating from a position of strength, only this time it was in a weak position, and according to Bjorn Fehrm, employees were out for revenge.",
      "\"It was obvious to them that the old management had basically screwed them. That was the sentiment. They were absolutely disgusted with how they had been treated in the old contract,\" he explains.",
      "The result was a bitter dispute, at a time when the company was trying to instil a new working culture, and Mr Ortberg had promised to \"reset\" relations with its employees.",
      "Boeing had to dig deep to come up with a deal that satisfied their demands, which included a 38% pay rise over four years. According to consultants Anderson Economic Group, the strike cost the company more than $5.5 billion.",
      "Airbus versus Boeing: the fallout",
      "All of this came at a time when the aerospace giant was already struggling financially. In the first nine months of 2024 it racked up losses of nearly $8bn (\u00a36.3bn). As a result, it set out plans to cut 17,000 jobs, or a tenth of its workforce.",
      "Boeing's problems have taken a heavy toll on its business. Where once it went toe to toe with its European rival Airbus, it has now delivered fewer aircraft in each of the past five years.",
      "In the first nine months of 2024 it distributed 291 planes to its customers, while Airbus provided 497, according to Forecast International.",
      "For its customers, this has been frustrating. Ryanair, one of the biggest buyers of the 737 Max, has cut its growth forecasts for next year. In the US, Southwest Airlines has had to make job cuts.",
      "Yet Airbus is not in a position to take full advantage of this. Its own order books are full to bursting, with a backlog of nearly 8,700 planes. Like its rival, it has experienced problems with suppliers, leading to delays.",
      "Meanwhile, airlines want new planes. Estimates from both Boeing and Airbus suggest more than 40,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades.",
      "The current generation of aircraft are much more efficient and cheaper to run than their predecessors. So delays in renewing their fleets will cost airlines money \u2013 potentially leading to higher ticket prices for their passengers - as well as hampering efforts to improve their environmental performance.",
      "According to Mr Fehrm, all this creates an opening for a third player to take a stake in the market. \"Over the next five to 10 years there will be a gap between what the market is asking for and what Airbus and Boeing can deliver by thousands of aircraft.",
      "\"So it's open for a third player. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer is a candidate. Or it's going to be a chance for Comac, the Chinese supplier, to come into different markets and say, 'Actually, we can do a decent job here.'\"",
      "A 'borderline miraculous' revival?",
      "In early December Mike Whitaker, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), visited the factory in Renton near Seattle that Mr Mohawk has raised concerns about. At the time, Mr Whitaker said: \"What's truly needed is a fundamental cultural shift that's oriented around safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training.",
      "\"As expected, Boeing has made progress executing its comprehensive plan in these areas, and we will continue to closely monitor the results as they begin to ramp up production following the strike.\"",
      "But for many experts, the problems at Boeing go back decades \u2013 and are unlikely to be solved overnight.",
      "\"The hardest thing to change in large companies is the mindset of people,\" says Mr Fehrm. \"It takes time, and it needs to be manifested in actions, doing things differently.",
      "\"There are changes coming, but people won't look at what the top management under Kelly Ortberg say. They will look for actions.\"",
      "Some observers believe Mr Ortberg has an opportunity now to improve the company's fortunes. Mr Dunlop thinks a change in mindset will be fundamental to Boeing's future.",
      "\"The fastest way to turn around a company is to have a complete change in attitude on how you treat your employees, how you treat your customers, and most importantly in how you treat your suppliers.\"",
      "A complete reversal of its previous approach could produce a \"borderline miraculous\" revival, he believes.",
      "But others are less confident. Captain Dennis Tajer, the lead spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association (the pilots' union for American Airlines), believes real change at Boeing has to come, not from the boardroom, but from further down the company's ranks.",
      "\"The solution is below senior management,\" he argues.",
      "\"It's at the middle management level, where you find the gatekeepers and the people who support doing things properly, not just keeping the schedule going.\"",
      "The stakes, he insists, could not be higher.",

    "title": "Elon Musk's 'social experiment on humanity': How X evolved in 2024",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

      "\"It is unreal at the minute. I put a job post up a couple of weeks ago and it took me two weeks just to find one applicant. I tried advertising on Facebook, I had posters up in the window.",
      "\"A couple of years ago I'd have one poster up in the window and about six applicants coming in. It's so different.\"",
      "Mr Barry said the rural location and \"unsociable hours\" made it trickier for some people but said he \"loved coming to work\" and meeting the customers.",
      "Samantha Harper, managing director or Red Dragon Pubs, which owns the pub Mr Barry works in, said it felt like the industry had been in \"perma-crisis\" since Covid.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:04:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Hurricane Beryl lashed the island in July, devastating much of its fishing fleet.",
    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",
      "\"We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,\" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete.",
      "\"What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,\" he adds.",
      "Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going.",
      "\"Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.\""

    "summary": "Manmohan Singh was instrumental in bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation.",
    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",
      "While studying at Cambridge, the lack of funds bothered Singh, his daughter, Daman Singh, wrote in a book on her parents.",
      "\"His tuition and living expenses came to about \u00a3600 a year. The Panjab University scholarship gave him about \u00a3160. For the rest he had to depend on his father. Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",
      "Manmohan Singh defended his record, saying his government had worked with \"utmost commitment and dedication for the country and the welfare of its people\".",
      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters."

      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is now seeking views from automotive and charging experts to \"restore clarity\" on how to deliver the ban.",
      "Car industry leaders have warned drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and charging point infrastructure.",
      "Last month, Ford said the UK government's mandate to produce and sell more electric vehicles (EVs) \"just doesn't work\" without demand.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "The Department for Transport said the consultation would \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry\" so they \"have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\".",
      "'The price point is crazy'",
      "But some say they are not yet sold on switching to EVs. Kaylan Evans from London said she wouldn't buy an electric car because \"the price point is crazy\".",
      "\"I don't like the element of relying on charging points and stations when the infrastructure isn't that set up at the moment,\" she added.",
      "She said she and her husband are sticking to their petrol car for now.",

      "She wants to move away from her diesel car because of \"the rising cost of fuel and the environmental issues\".",
      "Hybrid sales",
      "The government said the consultation would be part of a \"wider push\" to make it easier and cheaper to charge electric cars.",
      "There are now more than 72,000 public charging points in the UK, with another 100,000 planned by local authorities across England, according to the government.",
      "The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and homes without private parking spaces poses an issue as well - one that analysts will take several years to resolve.",
      "The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts.",
      "The government said EVs made up one in four cars sold in the UK. It said industry data put 1 in 3 used electric cars at under \u00a320,000.",
      "Edmund King, president of the AA, said drivers have been \"hesitant about the transition but not hostile\" but the consultation would bring more clarity and certainty.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said it was \"imperative we get an urgent resolution\" to adapt the mandate to help car makers achieve it along with \"bold incentives\" to get drivers to buy electric vehicles.",
      "The consultation proposes updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle (Zev) mandate, which sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise. Firms failing to meet these targets face a \u00a315,000 fine per sale.",
      "Companies can avoid fines by buying \"credits\" from firms that have exceeded their quotas for electric car sales. They can also \"borrow\" allowances from future years.",
      "The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank said target required to be achieved by each manufacturer was due to be reached as an average across the industry because these credits would be taken into account.",
      "Colin Walker, transport lead at the ECIU added: \"Certain manufacturers are proving themselves not just equal but better to the task they've been set. The likes of BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, for example. They are all selling more EV's than they need to. It's proof it can be done and that more ambitious targets in the years ahead can be hit.\"",

      "The government's eight-week consultation aims to gather views on which cars can be sold alongside zero emission vehicles from 2030, including full hybrids and plug-in hybrids, as well as the strategy for vans and the policy for small volume manufacturers.",
      "More than two-thirds of car manufacturers in the UK, including Stellantis, have committed to transitioning fully to electric cars by 2030.",
      "However, firms have also announced thousands of job cuts, partly because of EV targets.",
      "UK car production experienced a sharp decline in October 2024, with overall output dropping by over 15% compared to the previous year. Automotive industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed this fall to weak demand and a significant decrease in exports.",
      "Electric and hybrid vehicle production saw an even steeper decline, falling by one-third due to flagging European demand and factory retooling for new models.",
      "\"Today's measures will help us capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain,\" Alexander said.",
      "Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK said this was an opportunity to position the UK as \"one of the most attractive battery EV markets on the global stage.\" He said there was a growing demand for used and new batteries, and this roadmap would give manufacturers and users more clarity."

      "Bridget Phillipson defended the government ending the exemption from Wednesday.",
      "Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she said \"very few families\" would leave the schools as a result. Separately, she told the Sunday Times she had the support of middle-class parents as they had already been \"priced out\" of private education.",
      "The Conservatives labelled the decision a \"vindictive policy that will worsen the education of every single child, regardless of the school they are educated in\".",
      "The policy was outlined by the Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the autumn Budget.",
      "The money raised would go towards investing in state schools and teacher recruitment, Phillipson wrote in the Telegraph. She added that \u00a31.8bn would be raised a year by 2029-30.",
      "But the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents most of the UK's private schools, said the money the government claimed it would raise was an \"estimate, not a fact\".",
      "\"The negative effects of this unprecedented tax on education will be felt by families and children across state and independent schools,\" the ISC's chief executive, Julie Robinson said on Sunday.",
      "Ms Robinson added that they are not alone in predicting that the policy \"could cost the treasury money and would damage state education\" due to the cost of educating more children in the sector.",
      "Approximately 93% of children in the UK currently attend state schools, Phillipson said.",
      "The government has pledged to recruit 6,500 more teachers funded by the money raised in the policy, Phillipson said.",
      "She added that \"high-quality\" teaching has the biggest impact on children's learning, but that \"in some key subjects the teacher pipeline has been running dry\".",
      "Schools have been struggling to hire teachers in maths, science, and design and technology, she said.",
      "Phillipson added that \"very few\" families would move out of private schools, according to the government's impact assessment.",
      "In October however, the ISC said some private schools reported a 4.6% drop in pupil attendance in secondary school uptake, which it attributed to parents now deciding against sending their children to private school.",
      "Acknowledging the policy as an area \"where feelings run high\", Phillipson said that some of the conversations around it have been \"scaremongering\".",
      "She also told the Sunday Times that she had received abuse over the policy, but would wear it as a \"badge of honour\" if it meant driving up the standards of state schools.",
      "She added that the policy was supported by \"middle-class parents in good professional jobs with housing costs [who] just can't afford that level of fee\" and want \"brilliant state schools\".",
      "Emphasising the importance of investment into state schools in her Telegraph piece, Phillipson said raising the standards of such establishments was the \"route to better life chances\u2026 and a stronger society and economy\".",
      "A Conservative spokesperson added: \"The idea that middle-class parents support this bitter policy is simply not true.",

      "Only 40.1% of fourth year pupils - typically aged 14-16 years old - achieved a pass rate for National 5 mathematics in 2024, while 75.2% passed English. Just over 25% passed the most popular science subject, biology.",
      "The Scottish government said that not all pupils sit National 5 exams in S4.",
      "The Commission on School Reform is an independent group of education experts, set up by think tank Reform Scotland.",
      "Its latest report analyses SQA exam data based on the number of pupils in the cohort, rather than the number which sit the examination.",

      "Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ms Ford said issues like staffing could be a contributing factor to the reason for the decline in student performance, but Scotland does not collect enough data to examine the true cause.",
      "She said: \"One of the things that the Scottish government said was they felt that the drop in the number doing maths in particular was because we support a curriculum of pupil choice.",
      "\"Pupils are choosing subjects on the basis of where they are most likely to succeed and that's even more concerning because we have to ask ourselves, why do fewer pupils now expect to succeed in maths and in stem subjects?",
      "\"For society as whole, this is not good news. Society develops on the back of an educated population and not having the level of education in sciences and mathematics that other countries do will be to Scotland's disadvantage.\"",
      "'Not good enough'",
      "Chair of Reform Scotland and former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell said it was \"very worrying\" that less than half of Scotland's 16-year-olds had passed National 5 maths.",
      "He added:  \"If our economic future is to be based around industries like renewable energy and health sciences, improving our pass rates in mathematics and the sciences is a matter of critical national importance.",
      "\"The deficit in our Stem pass rates revealed by this research is not good enough.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Scottish government said pupils, parents and teachers at individual school's are best placed to decide at what age national qualifications are taken.",
      "They added: \"They are best-placed to determine the correct pathway for each young person and this flexibility and child-centred approach has been a key feature of Curriculum for Excellence for many years.",
      "\"One of the most important aspects of such decisions is that young people are entered at the level of qualification at which they have the best chance of achieving success.\"",
      "These figures demonstrate the way in which the senior phase in secondary schools operates.",
      "The emphasis is on what a student has achieved by the time they leave school - not what they have obtained at the end of a particular school year.",
      "The overwhelming majority of students - not just the academically able - now remain in school until S6.",
      "Some students may not obtain a National 5 qualification in maths in S4 but go on to get one in S5.",
      "Another factor is worth considering too.",
      "Once English and maths, or at least arithmetic, were effectively compulsory for students in S4.",
      "Now they are often just options, albeit relatively popular ones.",
      "This reflects how many schools only allow students to do a maximum of six National 4 or 5 courses in S4.",
      "There are several issues worthy of discussion.",
      "One is whether young people at all schools should have the chance to obtain more than 6 qualifications in S4.",
      "Another is whether certain subjects should, in effect, be mandatory as was once the case. (Until the 1980s any student with a reasonable prospect of passing was expected to do O Grade English and Maths. From the late 80s on, most would study Standard Grade courses in these subjects at the appropriate level.)",
      "If, however, compulsion is not the answer some supporters of particular subjects may want to consider if more can be done to make them attractive options which a greater number of students might positively choose."

      "That accidental choice changed his life. Twelve years on, he is an English teacher in South Korea - and he says he loves it here: \u201cI have got to try all the foods I\u2019ve seen in K-dramas, and I\u2019ve gotten to see several of the K-pop artists in concerts whose lyrics I used to study Korean.\u201d",

Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",

      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",

      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",
      "\"[They] are impossible love stories between a super-rich guy and a girl who is usually poor, and, you know, the guy is there to save her and it really sells you a dream.\"",
      "But it is Korean women who are writing most of these shows \u2013 so it is their imagination, or fantasy, that is capturing the interest (and hearts) of other women across the world.",
      "In Seoul, Marie said she was \u201ctreated like a lady\u201d, which hadn\u2019t happened \u201cin a very long time\u201d, but her \u201cdating experience is not exactly as I expected it to be\u201d.",
      "\u201cI do not want to be a housewife. I want to keep working. I want to be free. I want to go clubbing with my girlfriends if I want to, even though I'm married or in a relationship, and a lot of guys here do not want that.\u201d",
      "International fans are often looking for an alternative world because of disappointment with their own society, Prof Chung says.",
      "The prim romances, with handsome, caring and chivalrous heroes, are drawing a female audience turning away from what they see as hypersexual American entertainment. And when social inequality became a stronger theme in Korean films and shows - such as Parasite and Squid Game \u2013 it attracted global viewers disillusioned with capitalism and a yawning wealth divide in their countries.",
      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",
      "And there is now a bigger spotlight on the industry's less glamorous side. The immense pressure stars face to be perfect, for instance, and the demands of a hyper-competitive industry. Creators behind blockbuster shows have alleged exploitation and complained about not being fairly compensated.",
      "Still, it\u2019s great to see the world pay attention to Korea, Prof Chung says. She grew up in a repressive South Korea, when critics of the government were regularly threatened or even killed. She escaped into American movies.",
      "When Parasite played in the cinema of the small American town where she lives, she saw on the faces of other moviegoers the same awe she felt as a child watching Hollywood films: \u201cIt feels so great that our love is returned.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 01:56:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Women-led Indian films have made a splash across the world this year, including at major festivals.",
    "story": [
      "In 2024, as Bollywood struggled to find its footing, smaller films by Indian women that told nuanced stories made headlines in the country and across the world.",
      "In May, Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light made history by winning the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival.",
      "In the months since then, All We Imagine As Light has become a juggernaut of indie cinema, sweeping through film festivals and the awards circuit. It has been judged the Best International film by prestigious associations including the New York Film Critics Circle and the Toronto Film Critics Association. It has also picked up two Golden Globe nominations, including for Ms Kapadia as best director.",
      "It is also on several best films of the year list, including that of the BBC and the New York Times.",
      "And it has company.",
      "Director Shuchi Talati's coming-of-age drama Girls Will Be Girls won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies (Lost Ladies) spent at least two months on the top 10 list of Netflix in India and was picked as the country's official Oscar entry (a controversial decision). Laapataa Ladies didn't make it to the Academy's shortlist. What did make it was British-Indian director Sandhya Suri's Hindi film Santosh, which had been picked as the UK's submission to the Oscars.",
      "Is this sudden wave of success for Indian films an aberration or a long-awaited shift in global consciousness?",
      "\"It's a culmination of both,\" says film critic Shubhra Gupta, pointing out that these films were not \"made overnight\".",
      "For instance, Shuchi Talati, the director of Girls Will Be Girls, and its co-producer Richa Chadha were in college together when they first came up with the idea for the film. \"They have been working on it for years,\" Gupta says.",
      "\"It's pure serendipity that 2024 became the year these films were released, igniting conversations together.\"",
      "This fortunate alignment has been a cinematic dream. The global impact of these films is rooted in their quality and exploration of universal themes like loneliness, relationships, identity, gender and resilience. With strong female voices and unconventional feminist narratives, these stories venture into territories unexplored by mainstream Indian cinema.",
      "In All We Imagine As Light, a film made in the Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam languages, three migrant women in Mumbai navigate empathy, resilience and human connection. The narrative delves into themes of loneliness and the socio-political landscape, notably the scrutiny of interfaith Hindu-Muslim relationships as seen with the character Anu (Divya Prabha) and her bond with Shiaz (Hridhu Haroon).",
      "Kapadia told the BBC that while the women in her films are financially independent, they still face limitations in their personal lives, particularly when it comes to matters of love.",
      "\"For me, love in India is very political\u2026 women seem to hold a lot of the so-called honour of the family and the protection of the caste lineage. So if she marries somebody who is of a different religion or of a different caste, that becomes an issue. For me, it is really a method to control women and infantilise them,\" she says.",
      "Talati's Girls Will Be Girls explores female adolescence, rebellion and intergenerational conflict through the story of a 16-year-old girl studying at a strict boarding school in the Himalayas and her fractured relationship with her mother, Anila, who struggles with her own vulnerabilities and unresolved emotions.",
      "\"It is the kind of coming-of-age film that we don't do in India at all,\" Gupta says. \"It looks at women from a very empathetic, very warm gaze.\"",
      "\"The age where people experience emotions with and without their bodies, their minds, that exploration but without infantilising the experience - it was never part of Indian mainstream cinema,\" she adds.",
      "Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies did not perform well at the box-office but got warm reviews from viewers and critics. At a BAFTA screening in London this month, Ms Rao described the current moment as \"really special for women from India\", expressing hope for a continued wave of such stories.",
      "Her film is a satirical comedy about two newlywed brides getting accidentally swapped on a train because of their veils. It offers a sharp commentary on patriarchy, identity and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centred mainstream Indian films.",
      "\"A lot of us who are very patriarchal in our thinking are often that way because that's how we have been brought up,\" Bollywood star Aamir Khan, a co-producer of the film, said after the screening. \"But we need to be understanding, at least try and help each other even to come out of this kind of thinking.\"",
      "The biggest surprise this year came from the UK, which selected the Hindi-language film Santosh, directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, as its Oscar entry. Shot entirely in India over a 44-day schedule, it featured a largely female crew. Starring Indian actors Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajbhar, Santosh was co-produced by people and companies across the UK, India, Germany and France.",
      "The film is intrinsically an Indian story about violence against women, set as a taut thriller.",
      "Goswami says the success of Santosh and All We Imagine as Light points to the merging of borders and expansion of film industries, creating space for cross-pollination and exchange.",
      "\"We often think these Indian films require [specific] cultural context, but they don't. Any film driven by emotion will resonate universally, regardless of its origins,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Three of the films - All We Imagine as Light, Girls Will Be Girls and Santosh - share one more common trait: they are cross-country co-productions.",
      "Goswami agrees that this could this be a formula for the future.",
      "\"With a French producer, for example, a film gains the opportunity to be seen by a French audience who may follow that producer or the broader film industry. This is how it becomes more globally accessible and relevant,\" she says.",
      "Even in Bollywood, some women-led films have had huge success this year. Stree 2, a horror-comedy about a mysterious woman battling a monster who abducts free-thinking women, was the year's second-biggest hit, playing in cinemas for months.",
      "On streaming platforms, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's opulent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, an exploration of the misogyny and exploitation in the lives of courtesans in pre-independent India, was among Google's top-searched TV shows of the year.",
      "Their success seems to signal a growing appetite for such stories, their broad appeal demonstrating that mainstream cinema can address important themes without sacrificing entertainment value.",
      "Despite systemic challenges, 2024 has highlighted the global power of female voices from India and the demand for diverse stories. The momentum could be crucial for the Indian film industry in getting wider distribution for its independent films and pave the way for a more diverse and equitable film landscape."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 02:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Carmen Souza's latest album is inspired by the little-known British influence on the Cape Verde islands.",
    "story": [
      "When she was a young child and taking too long to get ready for school, family get-togethers or to sing in the church choir, Cape Verdean musician Carmen Souza was often told to \"ariope\".",
      "What she did not realise until years later was that the Creole word came directly from the English word \"hurry up\".",
      "\"We have so many words that derive from the British English,\" Souza, a jazz singer-songwriter and instrumentalist, tells the BBC.",
      "\"'Salong' is 'so long', 'fulespide' is 'full speed', 'streioei' is 'straightaway', 'bot' is 'boat', and 'ariope' - which I always remember my father saying to me when he wanted me to pick up my pace.\"",
      "Ariope is now one of eight songs that Souza has composed for the album Port'Ingl\u00eas - meaning English port - to explore the little-known history of the 120-year-old British presence in Cape Verde. It started off as research for her master's degree.",
      "\"Cape Verdeans are very connected to music - in fact, we always say that music is our biggest export - and so I wondered whether there was also a musical impact,\" she says.",
      "There are very few recordings of compositions of the time - Souza did discover that an American ethnomusicologist, Helen Heffron Roberts, recorded some in the 1930s but they are on very fragile wax cylinders and can only be listened to in person at Yale University in the US.",
      "So rather than rearranging old recordings, Souza - and her musical partner Theo Pas'cal - created new music, inspired by stories she came across.",
      "She has combined jazz and English sea shanties with Cape Verdean rhythms - including the funan\u00e1, played on an iron rod with a knife and the accordion, and the batuque, played by women and based on African drumming rhythms.",
      "The Cape Verdean islands lie about 500km (310 miles) off the coast of West Africa. They are mostly arid, with limited arable land and prone to drought.",
      "But they are a strategic midway point in the Atlantic Ocean, and they were first controlled by the Portuguese as they traded between south-east Asia, Europe and the Americas - in spices, silk and enslaved people. With the abolition of the slave trade, Cape Verde went into decline.",
      "Cape Verde remained a Portuguese colony until 1975 - but during the 18th and 19th Centuries, British merchants settled and Cape Verde once again became a bustling crossroads.",
      "The British came for the cheap labour, goats, donkeys, salt, turtles, amber and archil, a special ink that was used in British clothes manufacturing.",
      "They built roads, bridges and developed the natural ports - which became known as Port'Ingl\u00eas - and set up coaling stations, with coal brought in from Wales.",
      "S\u00e3o Vicente's Mindelo port became a vital refuelling stop for steamships carrying goods across the Atlantic Ocean or to Africa - and an important global communications hub with the 1875 arrival of a submarine cable station.",
      "Souza's exploration of the British presence in Cape Verde quickly became personal.",
      "\"As I started to research, I found so many personal connections,\" Souza says - including the fact that her grandfather loaded coal on to ships in Mindelo.",
      "That inspired her to write Ariope - the story of an older man urging a younger man, who prefers to stay in the shade playing his guitar, to \"ariope\". The British ships are coming and the sailors do not like to wait - \"fulespide, streioei\", the song goes.",
      "Souza imagines the spirit of her grandfather in the song. He used to play the fiddle - and was known as a great storyteller.",
      "\"I was told that if you had to walk with him for kilometres, you wouldn't notice the distance because it would be one funny story after another.\"",
      "Souza is part of Cape Verde's large diaspora. She was born in Portugal, and now lives in London. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are about 700,000 Cape Verdeans living abroad - twice as many as at home.",
      "Historically, people were forced to move for work because of famine, drought, poverty and lack of opportunities.",
      "This movement contributed to the islands' deep, rich tradition of strongly distinctive music, including the melancholic morna made famous by singer Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora and declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco in 2019.",
      "The composer behind many of the songs that made \u00c9vora a global star was Francisco Beleza - also known as B L\u00e9za. He revolutionised morna and was one of Cape Verde's most influential writers, composers and morna singers.",
      "According to Souza's research, he also considered the British presence to be more beneficial than the Portuguese - at least to middle-class Cape Verdeans.",
      "Souza's track Amizadi, a mix of funan\u00e1 and jazz, was inspired by B L\u00e9za's admiration of the British. He composed a morna - Hitler ca ta ganha guerra, ni nada, meaning \"Hitler will not win the war\" to show solidarity with the British people during World War II - and even raised money for the British war effort.",
      "Souza found that ports were \"an important hub for musicians\" who flocked there to learn the music - and instruments - of visiting foreign sailors.",
      "They blended them with Cape Verdean rhythms to create new sounds. The mazurka - derived from a Polish musical form - and contradan\u00e7a from the British quadrille dance.",
      "Early written records of Cape Verdean music are scarce - the Portuguese colonists did not document life and society on Cape Verde other than records of taxes and commodities.",
      "They also banned the batuque - for being too noisy and too African - and funan\u00e1 because its lyrics challenged social inequalities.",
      "But Souza found an intriguing entry in the diary of British naturalist Charles Darwin, who arrived in Cape Verde in 1832 - the first stop on his famous Beagle voyage to study the living world.",
      "He describes an encounter with a group of about 20 young women who, writes Darwin, \"sung with great energy a wild song, beating with their hands upon their legs\".",
      "That, says Souza, is most probably an early performance of batuque - and she was inspired to write the song Sant Jago by Darwin's accounts of the warm hospitality he received on Cape Verde.",
      "Many younger Cape Verdean musicians tend not to play the islands' older rhythms, and some like the contradan\u00e7a are slowly dying out.",
      "Souza hopes that her Port'Ingl\u00eas album will inspire younger generations that \"there is a way to do something new with the traditional genres\".",
      "\"I always bring some different elements - improvisation, the piano, the flute, the jazz harmonisation - so that the music is going through another process of creolisation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Season two of Squid Game has received reviews as mixed as a Christmas selection box, with TV critics calling it everything from \"sensational\" to \"a letdown\".",
      "The Guardian said that after a pretty slow start, the returning series eventually turns into \"TV that will make you uncomfortably bloodthirsty indeed\".",
      "While the Times described it as a \"layered and nuanced story of revenge and redemption\".",
      "Netflix's most popular original show returned to our screens on Boxing Day with protagonist Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) - aka Player 456 - back for more, three years after his victory in the lethal series of children's games.",
      "*This article contains spoilers*",
      "The first season of the South Korean drama followed a group of 456 people, desperate and in debt, fighting to the death for a huge cash prize.",
      "This time around, the previous winner is joined by hundreds of new competitors who he tries to guide to safety.",
      "The new episodes find the main character \"hellbent on seeking revenge on the super-rich puppet-masters who engineered its deadly spectacle\", according to the Guardian's Rebecca Nicholson, who awarded three stars.",
      "But the early episodes \"feel like delaying tactics\", she added, \"and considering that this is Squid Game, it is all rather ordinary\".",
      "\"When we get into the actual games, the smash-hit K-drama finds its feet,\" she noted. \"But it spends far too many episodes dragging its heels extremely painfully.\"",
      "Series three, which has already been commissioned for 2025, \"must do better\", she concluded.",
      "\"For all of its unevenness, particularly as it is warming up to the proper action, there is one big twist that really works, though whether it is distinct enough from what happens in the first series is unclear,\" wrote Nicholson.",
      "\"And when you think you know where it is going, it turns away from its trajectory, upping the ante and finding its feet. What a shame it takes so long to get there though.\"",
      "The first series, which the Times' Tim Glanfield notes was viewed as a \"dystopian commentary on the ills of late-stage capitalism\", became Netflix's biggest ever series launch - streamed by 111 million users in its first 28 days.",
      "The Times critic offered four stars for season two, saying: \"The key to the success of this sensational return is the careful and thoughtful pacing, combined with hints of light within the gruesome shade.",
      "\"Although the obvious temptation is to throw the viewer straight back into the arena of horror, with 456 new breathless players being manipulated and mutilated in ever-more creative ways (don't worry, there's plenty of that to come), the first few episodes confidently explore life on the outside.\"",
      "He added: \"This is a story of revenge and redemption: more layered, more nuanced and more complex than the original series.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Ed Power gave season two only three stars however, comparing it to the \"equivalent of a difficult second album from an overnight pop star\".",
      "\"It has lots of what you loved about the first Squid Game, from 2021, but has little interest in surpassing, much less subverting, its predecessor\".",
      "'Impossible to replicate shock'",
      "A second series was not always on the cards. At one point creator Hwang Dong-hyuk swore against making another, given the stress of the first had seen him lose quite a few teeth.",
      "Like the characters in the show, it seems he is mainly in season two for the money.",
      "\"Even though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn't make much,\" he told the BBC. \"So doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\"",
      "\"And I didn't fully finish the story,\" he added.",
      "His dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time high audience expectations.",
      "The Independent's Annabel Nugent said she thinks the director got it bang on with his approach, awarding the new series four stars.",
      "\"Squid Game season 2 is nowhere near as shocking as the first \u2013 but isn't that the point?\" she wrote.",
      "\"It is impossible to replicate the shock of the first season, and writer Hwang Dong Hyuk does well not to try.\"",
      "Among the new characters to the game, Nugent noted is \"No Eul, a North Korean defector forced to leave her baby behind\", \"Gyeong Seok, a theme-park caricaturist who needs money to pay for his daughter's cancer treatment\" and \"Myung Gi, a former YouTube star and crypto bro who lost his money in a scam\".",
      "Squid Game stalwart Seong Gi-hun tries to help them as well as \"a young pregnant girl who hides her growing belly beneath her baggy tracksuit\" and \"a transgender ex-military officer hoping for a new, more accepting life in Thailand\".",
      "\"Where the first series relied on shock for horror, each death landing like a brisk whack to the back of your head, season two derives terror from what we know as returning audiences, positioning Gi Hun once again as our surrogate,\" wrote Nugent.",
      "Squid Game season 2 review: 'A highly welcome return to this hellscape world'",
      "Squid Game season 2 review: 'A highly welcome return to this hellscape world'",
      "\"He also knows what comes next and yet even with that knowledge is powerless to stop it.\"",
      "She added: \"Stripping away the shock and peeling back the mystery that anchored season one is a risk, but one that allows Hwang to lay bare his show's stridently anti-capitalist message.\"",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Feinberg called season two \"a thorough letdown\".",
      "\"It's not a fundamental level on which Squid Game is broken, but season two simply doesn't work.\"",

      "\"Call the Midwife will always be a drama for me about women and the working classes,\" she tells the BBC.",

      "Thomas manages to cram in tough storylines into a cosy 8pm, Sunday night slot, often shared with shows such as Antiques Roadshow.",
      "There have only been two instances where she's been asked to change something in the show, which was initially set in 1957 and is about to hit the 1970s.",
      "\"One was for the haemorrhage machine,\" she recalls, describing a contraption which recreates post-birth blood loss.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:11:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Dynamic pricing, Katy Perry's comeback album, Joker 2 and Eurovision were among the biggest fails of 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Money, success, power, beauty - it often seems as if celebrities have everything they could possibly want.",
      "So it's just as well they also get tangled up in their fair share of mishaps, blunders and own goals every year.",
      "Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.",
      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",
      "Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due a backstage incident where a woman's video camera was knocked to the ground.",
      "Winner Nemo even accidentally broke the Eurovision trophy after placing it on stage, leaving the Swiss entrant with bandages after sustaining deep cuts to the thumb.",
      "Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\".",
      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",
      "Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK.",
      "ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.",
      "Another daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested).",
      "Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones.",
      "Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist.",
      "The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.",
      "12. The Oppenheimer stage invasion",
      "When Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background.",
      "The intruder was actually YouTuber Lizwani, who managed to infiltrate the event and make it all the way to the stage during the night's biggest moment.",
      "But the fact he was standing quietly and respectfully meant few viewers even noticed anything was wrong. Bafta have since tightened security.",
      "A month later, there was more awkwardness when Oppenheimer was named best picture at the Oscars, in an announcement fumbled by Al Pacino.",
      "Pacino dispensed with the traditional \"And the Oscar goes to...\"",
      "Instead, he stumbled through proceedings before announcing somewhat abruptly: \"My eyes see Oppenheimer.\"",
      "There was a delayed reaction from the audience and orchestra, who weren't entirely sure if Pacino was finished or if they had heard the winner correctly.",
      "But Scarface redeemed himself later in the year by revealing his delightful Shrek phone cover, courtesy of his young daughter. All was forgiven.",
      "13. Cynthia Erivo's poster reaction",
      "When one fan affectionately edited a promotional poster for Wicked to resemble the musical's original Broadway illustration, actress Cynthia Erivo said it erased her contribution to the film, because her eyes were hidden under her witch's hat.",
      "A barrage of memes followed as fans lightly poked fun at her reaction, with many social media users jokingly trying to avoid any further erasure by attaching pictures of Erivo to posts which had nothing to do with her.",
      "The original fan clarified that the altered film promo was intended to be \"an innocent fan edit to pay homage to the original Broadway poster\".",
      "But Erivo handled the backlash like a pro, making light of the situation and telling ET: \u201cFor me it was just like a human moment of wanting to protect little Elphaba. I probably should have called my friends.\"",
      "14. Rishi in the rain",
      "When Rishi Sunak called a general election in May, the then-prime minister made the announcement outdoors despite it bucketing with rain.",
      "Being in the open air also allowed an anti-Tory activist to disrupt the announcement by blasting music from a nearby speaker.",
      "But Sunak gamely stuck it out, later commenting that he was \"not a fair-weather politician\" and confirming he'd be taking an umbrella on the campaign trail.",
      "15. Tour troubles",
      "Live tours and concerts were disrupted this year for all kinds of reasons.",
      "Jennifer Lopez cancelled her live shows after reports of poor ticket sales, although she said it was so she could spend time with family and friends.",
      "Tenacious D's tour fell apart after one member made some ill-advised comments about Donald Trump.",
      "And Madonna's fans became increasingly frustrated with her lateness.",
      "Elsewhere, Adele repeatedly swore at an audience member in Las Vegas who she thought had shouted \"Pride sucks\". It transpired the fan had actually shouted \"work sucks\" after the singer discussed her working week. Oops.",
      "So fair play to Kate Nash for not only keeping her show on the road, but funding her tour by selling pictures of her bottom online, helpfully bringing publicity to the issues of high tour costs and poor streaming royalties in the process.",

      "And on Christmas Day, she equalled the record as the Street's most married character, alongside Street Cars stud Steve McDonald.",

      "But to her horror, it transpired her new beau had murdered not only his ex-wife but also Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw), as well as attempting to kill Gail's own mum Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire).",
      "Gail, with a now legendary line, branded Richard as \"Norman Bates with a briefcase\", a reference to the serial killer in classic Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho.",

      "When Eileen's other son Jason (Ryan Thomas) arrived on the scene from work, still wearing a hard hat, Gail declared: \"Here they are, the rest of the Village People!\"",
      "As the decades rolled on, the feud continued - but for a respectful ceasefire - with each woman aiming digs at the other about their respective love lives.",
      "It exploded again properly in 2015 when the pair argued over the affections of Gail's fifth husband Michael (Les Dennis).",

      "5. Falsely imprisoned for murder",
      "In 2010, Gail got married again, this time to Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale).",
      "This one wasn't any happier in the end, though, as he decided he was going to fake his own death due to debts.",
      "But he accidentally drowned for real on a boat trip, leading to his new wife being arrested for murder after witnesses said they'd seen the couple arguing (about his aforementioned plan).",
      "In prison, troublemaker Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) lied that her cellmate Gail had confessed to killing Joe.",
      "Luckily for one of the street's most downtrodden characters, Gail was found not guilty and released.",
      "6. Helping her son deal with his wife's death",
      "Gail had her troubles with son David (Jack P. Shepherd) as well, once accusing him of delibrately causing \"fear and misery to everyone in this family\".",
      "\"We've had sleepless nights,\" she added dramatically. \"I'm on pills, for God's sake!\"",
      "By 2016, David was a married man himself. However, that came to a tragic end when his wife Kylie (Paula Lane) was stabbed to death, dying in David's arms.",
      "Gail's motherly advice was for him to be honest with his own children about what had happened.",
      "In a heart-rending, tear-filled scene, she recalled the day she had struggled to tell her eldest son Nick (nowadays Ben Price) the truth about his dad Brian being killed, explaining that the boy had been left scarred.",
      "\"It was just about the worst conversation of my life,\" Gail told David, with a wry laugh to break the tension. \"And it's had some competition.\"",

      "\"Those moments, for me, were Corrie and were gold.",
      "\"They make me smile.\"",
      "7. Gail's moving monologue",
      "In 2018, Gail powerfully expressed the shock and grief of Weatherfield residents following the devastating suicide of factory boss Aidan Connor.",
      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",
      "\"And yet [she was saying], if you did know everybody's business then you would have seen this coming.\"",

She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",

      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",

    "summary": "Over the centuries, painters in India have depicted Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
    "story": [
      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy.",
      "\"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.",
      "Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities.",
      "In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).",

      "Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity.",

      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",

      "Then the pandemic hit and she lost her job. Aged 25, she had to move back in with her parents in Watford.",
      "She decided to start a skincare brand, despite knowing nothing about the industry. It was a big success until one wrong business decision, which triggered her trichotillomania - a hair-pulling disorder that meant she could not resist the urge to pull out her eyelashes.",

      "So I decided to spend the remaining \u00a38,000 of the company's cash on advertising but I didn't see a return from that. I had to reinvest my own savings back into the business because I had nothing but I still had people to pay and bills coming out.",

      "Dr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, previously told BBC News: \"For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go [and] visit it.",

      "The probe endured temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could have frazzled the on-board electronics.",
      "It was protected by an 11.5cm (4.5in) thick carbon-composite shield, but the spacecraft's tactic was to get in and out fast.",
      "In fact, it moved faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds.",

      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",

      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",

      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",

      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",

    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 01:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 02:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Out of 46 countries where elections were held, nearly two-thirds saw numbers of women elected fall - BBC finds.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly half the world's population - 3.6 billion people - had major elections in 2024, but it was also a year that saw the slowest rate of growth in female representation for 20 years.",
      "Twenty-seven new parliaments now have fewer women than they did before the elections - countries such as the US, Portugal, Pakistan, India, Indonesia and South Africa. And, for the first time in its history, fewer women were also elected to the European Parliament.",
      "The BBC has crunched numbers from 46 countries where election results have been confirmed and found that in nearly two-thirds of them the number of women elected fell.",
      "The data is from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) - a global organisation of national parliaments that collects and analyses election data.",
      "There were gains for women in the UK, Mongolia, Jordan and the Dominican Republic, while Mexico and Namibia both elected their first female presidents.",
      "However, losses in other places mean that the growth this year has been negligible (0.03%) - after having doubled worldwide between 1995 and 2020.",
      "Mariana Duarte Mutzenberg, who tracks gender statistics for the IPU, says progress has been \"too fragile\" in certain democracies. For example, the Pacific Island nation Tuvalu lost its only female member of parliament, and now has no women in government at all.",
      "The Pacific Islands have the lowest proportion of female members of parliament in the world at 8%.",
      "Globally, women make up 27% of parliaments worldwide, and only 13 countries are close to 50%. Latin America and parts of Africa are currently leading when it comes to female representation.",
      "Some countries, says Ms Duarte Mutzenberg, are still making gains, largely thanks to gender quotas - Mongolia jumped from 10% to 25% female representation this year, after introducing a mandatory 30% candidate quota for women.",
      "On average, countries without quotas have elected 21% women, compared with 29% with quotas.",
      "For example, quotas - and political will - helped Mexico achieve gender parity in 2018, after former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador decided the parliament should be 50% women.",
      "Political will could also be a game-changer when it comes to ministerial positions, says Julie Ballington from UN Women - which collects data on women heading government ministries.",
      "Cabinets have the power to impact society, yet still have the lowest female representation of all the political measures UN Women looks at, she says, with women usually restricted to certain ministerial roles such as overseeing human rights, equality, and social affairs - rather than finance or defence.",
      "This is \"a missed opportunity\", she says.",
      "With so many different countries, contexts and political intricacies at play it is hard to define why the dial hardly shifted this year.",
      "But there are some universal barriers to women's participation in politics.",
      "Firstly, research has shown there is an ambition gender gap.",
      "\"Women are less likely to wake up and think they would be good in senior leadership,\" professor of politics Rosie Campbell told an audience at King's College, London. \"They often need to be nudged: 'Have you thought about being an MP?'\"",
      "And a slow-down could mean fewer mentors for future female politicians, says Dr Rachel George, an expert on gender and politics at Stanford University in the US. So young women would be \"less likely to think that they can, or should, run\".",
      "Once they do decide to run for office, women tend to be at a disadvantage financially.",
      "A wealth of research has found it is harder for women to access funding for a political campaign or to have the financial freedom to take time off work.",
      "In most societies, women still have more caring responsibilities than men - which can negatively affect how they are viewed by voters, says Dr George.",
      "This is not helped by the fact that few parliaments offer maternity leave, says Carlien Scheele from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \"It puts women off if those policies are not in place,\" she says.",
      "And then, there is the way electoral systems are designed.",
      "Countries using proportional representation (PR) or mixed electoral systems elect a higher share of women than first-past-the-post systems and are also more likely to have electoral quotas for women, according to the IPU.",
      "But those factors are not new. So what is changing?",
      "There has been an increase in attacks on women in public life, online and in person, according to studies in many different countries.",
      "In Mexico, which already experiences violent elections, gender-based violence was particularly high this year, says IPU's Mariana Duarte Mutzenberg, with women politicians also particularly targeted by disinformation aimed at \"trying to ruin their reputation in one way or another\".",
      "This all has a wider \"chilling effect\" and stops younger women from wanting to run, says Dr George.",

      "NZ's incoming PM calls Ardern abuse 'abhorrent'",
      "A backlash to female economic empowerment and feminism is also a factor.",
      "In South Korea - despite a small increase in the share of women elected - a feeling among many young men of reverse discrimination played out in this year's election.",
      "\"Some parties continued to fuel or tap into an anti-gender sentiment among male voters who perceive women's rights advocates as anti-men,\" says Ms Duarte Mutzenberg.",
      "However, she says, this may have led to even more women coming out to vote.",

      "Studies have also shown the benefits of including women in peace negotiations, suggesting that processes which are based on substantive contributions from women are more likely to achieve sustainable outcomes.",

      "These threats to security and to trade revenues have helped remind the EU and the UK of the common values they share in unpredictable times.",
      "The EU felt weakened by Brexit in 2016. It meant losing a big economy and its only significant military power apart from France.",
      "As for post-Brexit UK, now free from the rules of EU membership, it's also now a far smaller power on the world stage.",
      "And, closer to home, the Labour government has realised Europe is key to delivering on a number of priority pledges to the UK public.",
      "\"The economy, defence, migration... there's a European element to all of this, making EU relations important for the whole government agenda. Things which will make a success of this government are tied up with Europe,\" says Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.",

      "An EU-UK summit is planned for spring, and a number of political figures and high-level diplomats from EU member states and the UK spoke to me on condition of anonymity ahead of bilateral negotiations getting started.",
      "I kept hearing of the \"enormous amount of goodwill\" in the EU towards the new Labour government with its oft-repeated \"reset\" enthusiasm.",
      "At the same time though, there is a clear note of Brussels scepticism the Labour government would do well to take heed of, if it wants to see tangible results.",
      "\"The headspace is there. The appetite is there in Europe for closer UK relations,\" one EU figure told me.",

      "It's relatively easy to formalise what is already happening: co-operation over Russia sanctions for example, as well as discussions - already taking place inside Nato - over military and defence capabilities and how to best protect Europe against cyber-attacks and attacks on key installations like energy infrastructure in the North Sea.",
      "It's seen as a win-win agreement.",
      "And there is no proposal to make a defence pact legally binding.",
      "The Labour government does not have to worry here about being seen - by the political opposition or those in the UK who voted Leave - as attempting to \"roll back Brexit\".  And it is sensitive about this potential accusation.",
      "But Labour has also made promises on trade and the economy: to \"make Brexit work\" and to \"tear down\" the trade barriers hard Brexit imposed. The Office for Budget Responsibility reckons Brexit will cost the UK economy 4% of GDP in the long term.",
      "Labour wants to avoid that, but that's not as straightforward as it might sound.",
      "No 'backdoor' for UK to EU trade deals",
      "EU figures say they're confused by the UK government proclaiming an \"ambitious\" reset while insisting on maintaining restrictive post-Brexit red lines.",

      "\"For us, it's like being in a weird tug of war. With the devil on one EU shoulder and an angel on the other. In terms of values, there is more that unites us than divides us with the UK.",
      "\"The EU wants to take action to get the UK closer, but on the other hand, we can't do away with technical minutiae that are the foundation of the EU. We can't make special deals, even if that limits the relationship with the UK.\"",
      "In order to see significant improvement in economic relations, both sides will have to make compromises.",
      "In Brussels, there is no appetite to rip up the TCA - the already-existing trade agreement between the EU and UK. But you do detect an EU openness to starting negotiations on different economic sectors simultaneously.",
      "\"We can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" insisted one EU diplomat.",
      "There's also an acknowledgement on the UK side that sectoral agreements might well have to involve aligning with EU rules in those sectors.",
      "EU looks for return of youth mobility scheme",
      "The key to any compromise that Labour might make with the EU going forward will be: Can they sell the result back home as a win for the British public?",
      "The EU will push hard for long term fishing rights in UK waters.",
      "It also wants a Youth Mobility Scheme, allowing 18-30 year olds to work and/or study in the UK or the EU for up to three years, paying local fees at university if they choose the study option.",
      "The UK government insists there will be no return to freedom of movement with the EU.",
      "Migration is a hot button issue. But it's notable that Labour has not explicitly ruled out the youth scheme. They've only said they've \"no plans\" to go for it.",
      "On youth mobility, the assumption is that more EU youngsters would take advantage of a mobility scheme than UK citizens because of language barriers.",
      "But the UK government might use openness to the EU-requested mobility scheme and/or a fishing agreement as leverage to negotiate something important for UK interests, such as the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which eases cross-Channel business, or the mobility of UK artists and entertainers to travel in the EU.",
      "Both of these were listed in the Labour election manifesto as priorities if the party got into government.",
      "Labour also wants to move on a veterinary agreement with the EU, to reduce barriers in the trade of food and agricultural products. That would require UK alignment with EU animal and plant health rules.",

      "The North Sea basin comprises the UK plus EU member states Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and Single Market member Norway. It's one of the most promising regions in the world for offshore wind.",
      "On illegal migration, the EU says it's open to co-operating more closely with the UK. It wants the UK to crack down more on people working illegally in the country.",
      "France complains that the ease with which it says irregular migrants can disappear and make a living is a major a pull-factor to the UK for economic migrants.",
      "The EU has ruled out the UK being able to send migrants, arriving illegally on its shores aboard small boats, back to the EU countries they set off from.",
      "Voters moving faster than their governments",
      "Whatever the developments in EU-UK relations in 2025 and beyond, they are likely to happen slowly because of political concerns and because negotiations have a habit of getting bogged down in detail.",
      "In direct contrast, a recent poll by YouGov and Datapraxis for the European Council of Foreign Relations suggests voters in the EU and UK are far more gung-ho than leaders in Brussels and London about jumping over previous political taboos to strengthen ties.",
      "The poll found that around half of those asked in the UK believe greater engagement with the EU is the best way to boost the UK economy (50%), strengthen its security (53%) and effectively manage migration (58%).",

      "A majority of voters in Poland (54%) and Germany (53%) \u2013 and a prevailing opinion in Spain (43%), Italy (42%) and France (41%) \u2013 believe the EU should grant the UK special access to certain parts of the European single market to secure a closer security-based relationship.",

      "On 10 January, the court is due to hear arguments on a US law that requires TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social media company to an American firm or face a ban come 19 January - a day before Trump takes office.",
      "US officials and lawmakers had accused ByteDance of being linked to the Chinese government - which the firm denies.",
      "Those allegations of an app that has 170 million users in the US led Congress to pass a bill in April, which President Joe Biden signed into law, that included the divest or ban requirement.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 23:53:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The killings have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse.",
    "story": [
      "\"The Chinese people are so miserable,\" read a social media post in the wake of yet another mass killing in the country earlier this year. The same user also warned: \"There will only be more and more copycat attacks.\"",
      "\"This tragedy reflects the darkness within society,\" wrote another.",
      "Such bleak assessments, following a spate of deadly incidents in China during 2024, have led to questions about what is driving people to murder strangers en masse to \"take revenge on society\".",
      "Attacks like this are still rare given China's huge population, and are not new, says David Schak, associate professor at Griffith University in Australia. But they seem to come in waves, often as copycat attempts at garnering attention.",
      "This year has been especially distressing.",
      "From 2019 to 2023, police recorded three to five cases each year, where perpetrators attacked pedestrians or strangers.",
      "In 2024, that number jumped to 19.",
      "In 2019, three people were killed and 28 injured in such incidents; in 2023, 16 dead and 40 injured and in 2024, 63 people killed and 166 injured. November was especially bloody.",
      "On the 11th of that month, a 62-year-old man ploughed a car into people exercising outside a stadium in the city of Zhuhai, killing at least 35. Police said that the driver had been unhappy with his divorce settlement. He was sentenced to death this week.",
      "Days later, in Changde city, a man drove into a crowd of children and parents outside a primary school, injuring 30 of them. The authorities said he was angry over financial losses and family problems.",
      "That same week, a 21-year-old who couldn't graduate after failing his exams, went on a stabbing rampage on his campus in Wuxi city, killing eight and injuring 17.",
      "In September, a 37-year-old man raced through a Shanghai shopping centre, stabbing people as he went. In June, four American instructors were attacked at a park by a 55-year-old man wielding a knife. And there were two separate attacks on Japanese citizens, including one in which a 10-year-old boy was stabbed to death outside his school.",
      "The perpetrators have largely targeted \"random people\" to show their \"displeasure with society\", Prof Schak says.",
      "In a country with vast surveillance capabilities, where women rarely hesitate to walk alone at night, these killings have sparked understandable unease.",
      "So what has prompted so many mass attacks in China this year?",
      "China's slowing economy",
      "A major source of pressure in China right now is the sluggish economy. It is no secret that the country has been struggling with high youth unemployment, massive debt and a real estate crisis which has consumed the life savings of many families, sometimes with nothing to show for it.",
      "On the outskirts of most major cities there are entire housing estates where construction has stopped because indebted developers cannot afford to complete them. In 2022, the BBC interviewed people camping in the concrete shells of their own unfinished apartments, without running water, electricity and windows because they had nowhere else to stay.",
      "Xi Jinping is worried about the economy - what do Chinese people think?",
      "A Japanese boy was killed in China. Was cyber-nationalism to blame?",
      "\"Optimism certainly does seem to have faded,\" says George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University's China Centre. \"Let's use the word trapped, just for the moment. I think China has become trapped in a sort of cycle of repression. Social repression and economic repression, on the one hand, and a kind of faltering economic development model on the other.\"",
      "Studies appear to point to a significant change in attitudes, with a measurable increase in pessimism among Chinese people about their personal prospects. A significant US-China joint analysis, which for years had recorded them saying that inequality in society could often be attributed to a lack of effort or ability, found in its most recent survey that people were now blaming an \"unfair economic system\".",
      "\"The question is who do people really blame?\" Mr Magnus asks. \"And the next step from that is that the system is unfair to me, and I can't break through. I can't change my circumstances.\"",
      "A lack of options",
      "In countries with a healthy media, if you felt you had been fired from your job unfairly or that your home had been demolished by corrupt builders backed by local officials, you might turn to journalists for your story to be heard. But that is rarely an option in China, where the press is controlled by the Communist Party and unlikely to run stories which reflect badly on any level of the government.",
      "Then there are the courts \u2013 also run by and for the party \u2013 which are slow and inefficient.  Much was made on social media here of the Zhuhai attacker's alleged motive: that he did not achieve what he believed was a fair divorce settlement in court.",
      "Experts say other outlets for venting frustrations have also narrowed or been shut down altogether.",
      "Chinese people often air their grievances online, says Lynette Ong, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, who has carried out significant research on how the Chinese state responds to push back from its people.",
      "\"[They] will go on to the internet and scold the government\u2026 just to vent their anger. Or they may organise a small protest which the police would often allow if it's small-scale,\" she explains. \"But this sort of dissent, small dissent, has been closed off in the last couple of years.\"",
      "There are plenty of examples of this: Increased internet censorship, which blocks words or expressions that are deemed controversial or critical; crackdowns on cheeky Halloween costumes that make fun of officialdom; or when plain-clothed men, who appeared to have been mobilised by local officials, beat up protesters in Henan province outside banks which had frozen their accounts.",
      "As for dealing with people's mental and emotional responses to these stresses, this too has been found wanting. Specialists say that China's counselling services are vastly inadequate, leaving no outlet for those who feel isolated, alone and depressed in modern Chinese society.",
      "\"Counselling can help build up emotional resilience,\" says Professor Silvia Kwok from Hong Kong's City University, adding that China needs to increase its mental health services, especially for at-risk groups who have experienced trauma or those with mental illness.",
      "\"People need to find different strategies or constructive ways to deal with their emotions\u2026 making them less likely to react violently in moments of intense emotional stress.\"",
      "Taken together, these factors suggest the lid is tightening on Chinese society, creating a pressure cooker-like situation.",
      "\"There are not a lot of people going around mass killing. But still the tensions do seem to be building, and it doesn't look like there is any way it is going to ease up in the near future,\" Mr Magnus says.",
      "What should worry the Communist Party is the commentary from the general public blaming those in power for this.",
      "Take this remark for example: \"If the government truly acts fairly and justly, there would not be so much anger and grievance in Chinese society\u2026 the government's efforts have focused on creating a superficial sense of harmony. While it may appear that they care about disadvantaged people, their actions have instead caused the greatest injustices.\"",
      "While violent attacks have been rising in many countries, according to Professor Ong, the difference in China is that officials have had little experience dealing with them.",
      "\"I think the authorities are very alarmed because they've not seen it before, and their instinct is to crack down.\"",
      "When China's leader Xi Jinping spoke about the Zhuhai attack, he seemed to acknowledge pressure was building in society. He urged officials across the country to \"learn hard lessons from the incident, address risks at their roots, resolve conflicts and disputes early and take proactive measures to prevent extreme crime\".",
      "But, so far, the lessons learnt seem to have led to a push for quicker police response times using greater surveillance, rather than considering any changes to the way China is run.",
      "\"China is moving into a new phase, a new phase that we have not seen since the late 70s,\" Prof Ong says, referring to the time when the country began opening to the world again, unleashing enormous change.",
      "\"We need to brace for unexpected events, such as a lot of random attacks and pockets of protest and social instability emerging.\"",

    "story": [
      "Actress Olivia Hussey, who shot to international prominence as a teenager for her role in the acclaimed 1968 film version of Romeo and Juliet, has died aged 73.",
      "The Argentine-born actress, who grew up in London, died on Friday surrounded by her loved ones, a statement posted on her Instagram said.",
      "Hussey won the best new actress Golden Globe for her part as Juliet, but decades later she sued Paramount Pictures for sexual abuse as she was aged just 15 when she filmed the movie's nude scene.",
      "Her other most notable screen role was as Mary, mother of Jesus, in 1977 TV miniseries Jesus of Nazareth.",
      "\"As we grieve this immense loss, we also celebrate Olivia's enduring impact on our lives and the industry,\" the statement said.",
      "Hussey was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1951, before moving to London aged seven and studying at the Italia Conti Academy drama school.",
      "She was 15 when Romeo and Juliet director Franco Zeffirelli discovered her onstage, playing opposite Vanessa Redgrave in the play The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.",
      "Zeffirelli was looking for someone who was young enough to be a convincing Juliet in what he intended to be the definitive cinematic version of the Shakespeare play.",
      "He cast Hussey alongside British 16-year-old Leonard Whiting as Romeo in the film.",
      "The film was nominated for an Oscar for best picture and director. Hussey missed out on an Oscar nomination herself in a strong year in which Barbra Streisand won the main award for Funny Girl.",
      "But at that year's Golden Globes, Hussey won the award for best new star.",
      "Decades later, she and Whiting sued Paramount Pictures alleging Zeffirelli - who died in 2019 - had encouraged them to film nude scenes despite previous assurances they would not have to.",
      "The pair sought damages of more than $500m (\u00a3417m), based on suffering they said they had experienced and the revenue brought in by the film since its release.",
      "But last year a judge dismissed the case, finding the scene was not \"sufficiently sexually suggestive\".",
      "In 1977, Hussey had reunited with Zeffirelli for Jesus of Nazareth to play the Virgin Mary, before appearing in Death on the Nile a year later based on Agatha Christie's novel.",
      "Her roles in early slasher film Black Christmas (1974)  and TV film Psycho IV: The Beginning earned her recognition as a scream queen. In the latter, she played Norman Bates's mother in a prequel storyline.",
      "In later years she also took on work as a voice actress, appearing frequently in video games.",
      "But she did have one final reunion with her former Romeo - as she and Whiting appeared together in the 2015 British film Social Suicide, which was loosely based on Romeo and Juliet and set in the social media era.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:04:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Hurricane Beryl lashed the island in July, devastating much of its fishing fleet.",
    "story": [
      "There are few clearer signs of the destructive power that Hurricane Beryl unleashed on Barbados in July than the scene at the temporary boatyard in the capital, Bridgetown.",
      "Scores of mangled and cracked vessels sit on stacks, gaping holes in their hulls, their rudders snapped off and cabin windows broken.",
      "Yet these were the lucky ones.",
      "At least they can be repaired and put back out to sea. Many others sank, taking entire family incomes with them.",
      "When Beryl lashed Barbados, the island's fishing fleet was devastated in a matter of hours. About 75% of the active fleet was damaged, with 88 boats totally destroyed.",
      "Charles Carter, who owns a blue-and-black fishing vessel called Joyce, was among those affected.",
      "\"It's been real bad, I can tell you. I had to change both sides of the hull, up to the waterline,\" he says, pointing at the now pristine boat in front of us.",
      "It has taken months of restoration and thousands of dollars to get it back to this point, during which time Charles has barely been able to fish.",
      "\"That's my living, my livelihood, fishing is all I do,\" he says.",
      "\"The fishing industry is mash up,\" echoes his friend, Captain Euride. \"We're just trying to get back the pieces.\"",
      "Now, six months after the storm, there are signs of calmer waters. On a warm Saturday, several repaired vessels were put back into the ocean with the help of a crane, a trailer and some government support.",
      "Seeing Joyce back on the water is a welcome sight for all fishermen in Barbados.",
      "But Barbadians are acutely aware that climate change means more active and powerful Atlantic hurricane seasons - and it may be just another year or two before the fishing industry is struck again. Beryl, for example, was the earliest-forming Category 5 storm on record.",
      "Few understand the extent of the problem better than the island's Chief Fisheries Officer, Dr Shelly Ann Cox.",
      "\"Our captains have been reporting that sea conditions have changed,\" she explains. \"Higher swells, sea surface temperatures are much warmer and they're having difficulty getting flying fish now at the beginning of our pelagic season.\"",
      "The flying fish is a national symbol in Barbados and a key part of the island's cuisine. But climate change has been harming the stocks for years.",
      "At the Oistins Fish Market in Bridgetown, flying fish are still available, along with marlin, mahi-mahi and tuna, though only a handful of stalls are open.",
      "At one of them, Cornelius Carrington, from the Freedom Fish House. fillets a kingfish with the speed and dexterity of a man who has spent many years with a fish knife in his hands.",
      "\"Beryl was like a surprise attack, like an ambush,\" says Cornelius, in a deep baritone voice, over the market's chatter, reggae and thwack of cleavers on chopping boards.",
      "Cornelius lost one of his two boats in Hurricane Beryl. \"It's the first time a hurricane has come from the south like that, normally storms hit us from the north,\" he said.",
      "Although his second boat allowed him to stay afloat financially, Cornelius thinks the hand of climate change is increasingly present in the fishermen's fate.",
      "\"Right now, everything has changed. The tides are changing, the weather is changing, the temperature of the sea, the whole pattern has changed.\"",
      "The effects are also being felt in the tourism industry, he says, with hotels and restaurants struggling to find enough fish to meet demand each month.",
      "For Dr Shelly Ann Cox, public education is key and, she says, the message is getting through.",
      "\"Perhaps because we are an island and we're so connected to the water, people in Barbados can speak well on the impact on climate change and what that means for our country,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if you speak to children as well, they're very knowledgeable about the topic.\"",
      "To see for myself, I visited a secondary school \u2013 Harrison College \u2013 as a member of a local NGO, the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network (CYEN), talked to members of the school's Environmental Club about climate change.",
      "The CYEN representative, Sheldon Marshall, is an energy expert who quizzed the pupils about greenhouse gases and the steps they could take at home to help reduce carbon emissions on the island.",
      "\"How can you, as young people in Barbados, help make a difference on climate change?\" he asked them.",
      "Following an engaging and lively debate, I asked the pupils how they felt about Barbados being on the front line of global climate change, despite having only a small carbon footprint itself.",
      "\"Personally, I take a very pessimistic view,\" said 17-year-old Isabella Fredricks.",
      "\"We are a very small country. No matter how hard we try to change, if the big countries \u2013 the main producers of pollution like America, India and China \u2013 don't make a change, everything we do is going to be pointless.\"",
      "Her classmate, Tenusha Ramsham, is slightly more optimistic.",
      "\"I think that all great big leaps in history were made when people collaborated and innovated,\" she argues. \"I don't think we should be completely disheartened because research, innovation, creating technology and education will ultimately lead to the future that we want.\"",
      "\"I feel if we can communicate to the global superpowers the pain that we feel seeing this happen to our environment,\" adds 16-year-old Adrielle Baird, \"then it would help them to understand and help us collaborate to find ways to fix the issues that we're seeing.\"",
      "For the island's young people, their very futures are at stake. Rising sea levels now pose an existential threat to the small islands of the Caribbean.",
      "It is a point on which the Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, has become a global advocate for change \u2013 urging greater action over an impending climate catastrophe in her speech at COP29 and calling for economic compensation from the world's industrialised nations.",
      "On its shores and in its seas, it feels like Barbados is under siege - dealing with issues from coral bleaching to coastal erosion. While the impetus for action comes from the island's youth, it is the older generations who have borne witness as the changes unfold.",
      "Steven Bourne has fished the waters around Barbados his whole life and lost two boats in Hurricane Beryl. As we look out at the coastline from a dilapidated beach-hut bar, he says the island's sands have shifted before his very eyes.",
      "\"It's an attack from the elements. You see it taking the beaches away, but years ago you'd be sitting here, and you could see the water's edge coming upon the sand. Now you can't because the sand's built up so much.\"",
      "By coincidence, in the same bar where I chatted to Steven was Home Affairs Minister Wilfred Abrahams, who has responsibility for national disaster management.",
      "I put it to him that it must be a a difficult time for disaster management in the Caribbean.",
      "\"The whole landscape has changed entirely,\" he replied. \"Once upon a time, it was rare to get a Category Five hurricane in any year. Now we're getting them every year. So the intensity and the frequency are cause for concern.\"",
      "Even the duration of the hurricane season has changed, he says.",
      "\"We used to have a rhyme that went: June, too soon; July, standby; October, all over,\" he tells me. Extreme weather events like Beryl have rendered such an idea obsolete.",
      "\"What we can expect has changed, what we've prepared for our whole lives and what our culture is built around has changed,\" he adds.",
      "Fisherman Steven Bourne had hoped to retire before Beryl. Now, he says, he and the rest of the islanders have no choice but to keep going.",
      "\"Being afraid or anything like that don't make no sense. Because there's nowhere for we to go. We love this rock. And we will always be on this rock.\""

    "title": "How a food crisis in India enriched America's library collections",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:18:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The treasure trove of South Asian books came from PL-480, a US initiative launched in 1954.",
    "story": [
      "In 1996, Ananya Vajpeyi, a doctoral student, discovered the fabled South Asia collection of books at the University of Chicago's Regenstein Library.",
      "\"I've spent time in some of the leading South Asia libraries of the world, at Oxford and Cambridge, Harvard and Columbia. But nothing has ever matched the unending riches held at the University of Chicago,\" Ms Vajpeyi, a fellow at India's  Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), told me.",
      "The 132-year-old University of Chicago houses more than 800,000 volumes related to South Asia, making it one of the world's premier collections for studies on the region. But how did such a treasure trove of South Asian literature end up there?",
      "The answer lies in a programme called PL-480, a US initiative launched in 1954 under Public Law 480, also known as the Food for Peace, a hallmark of Cold War diplomacy.",
      "Signed into law by President Dwight D Eisenhower, PL-480 allowed countries like India to buy US grain with local currency, easing their foreign exchange burden and reducing US surpluses. India was one of the largest recipients of this food aid, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s when it faced severe food shortages.",
      "The local currency funds were provided at minimal cost to participating US universities. These funds were used to purchase local books, periodicals, phonograph records, and \"other media\" in multiple Indian languages, enriching collections at over two dozen universities. Institutions like the University of Chicago became hubs for South Asian studies as a result. (Manuscripts were excluded due to Indian antiquity laws.)",
      "\"PL-480 has had amazing and unexpected consequences for the University of Chicago and for more than 30 other US collections,\" James Nye, director of the Digital South Asia library at University of Chicago, told the BBC.",
      "The process of building an impressive library collection from South Asia was no simple task.",
      "A special team staffed by 60 Indians was established in Delhi in 1959. Initially focused on picking up government publications, the programme expanded over five years to include books and periodicals. By 1968, 20 US universities were receiving materials from the growing collection, as noted by Maureen LP Patterson, a leading bibliographer of South Asian studies.",
      "In a paper published in 1969, Patterson recounted that in the early days of the PL-480, the team in India faced the challenge of sourcing books from a vast, diverse country with an intricate network of languages.",
      "They needed the expertise of booksellers with a reputation for good judgement and efficiency. Given India's size and the complexity of its literary landscape, no single dealer could handle the procurement on their own, Patterson, who died in 2012, wrote.",
      "Instead, dealers were selected from various publishing hubs, each focusing on specific languages or groups of languages. This collaboration worked seamlessly, with dealers sending titles they were not certain about for approval. The final selection rested with the Delhi office, Patterson noted.",
      "The programme was keen on picking up a comprehensive collection of Indian fiction in all languages. \"The policy netted a huge number of detective stories and novels of no lasting value,\" wrote Patterson.",
      "In 1963, the choice for acquiring books was narrowed down to \"research level material\" - and intake of fiction in many languages was halved. By 1966, more than 750,000 books and periodicals were sent to American universities from India, Nepal and Pakistan, with India contributing more than 633,000 items.",
      "\"We've sent works like History of India from 1000 to 1770 AD, Handicrafts in India, Hindu Culture and Personality: A Psychoanalytic Study, and more,\" a report on a meeting in an US library on the programme in 1967 said.",
      "Todd Michelson-Ambelang, librarian for South Asian studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, wonders if vast collections from the region in US and other Western libraries took away literary resources from the Indian sub-continent.",
      "Founded during Cold War tensions and funded by PL-480, his university's South Asia centre grew its library to more than 200,000 titles by the 21st Century.",
      "Mr Michelson-Ambelang told the BBC that the removal of books from South Asia through programmes like PL-480 \"creates knowledge gaps\", as researchers from there often need to travel to the West to access these resources.",
      "It is unclear whether all the books acquired by US universities from India at that time are still available there. According to Maya Dodd, of India's FLAME University, many books now unavailable in India can be found in the University of Chicago's library collections, all marked with the stamp saying \"PL-480\".",
      "\"For the most part, books that came through the PL-480 programme are still available in South Asia. But preservation is often a challenge due to white ants, pests, and a lack of temperature and humidity control. In contrast, most materials in the West remain well-preserved thanks to the preservation and conservation efforts in our libraries,\" Mr Michelson-Ambelang says.",
      "Another reason why Mr Michelson-Ambelang calls the Western libraries colonial archives \"partly is because they serve academics, often excluding those outside their institutions. While librarians understand the disparities in access to South Asian materials, copyright laws limit sharing, reinforcing these gaps\".",
      "So, what happened when the PL-480 programme ended?",
      "Mr Nye says the end of the programme in the 1980s, shifted the financial burden to American libraries. \"Libraries in the US have had to pay for the selection, acquisition, collection, and delivery of resources,\" he said. For example, the University of Chicago now spends more than $100,000 annually on buying books and periodicals  through the Library of Congress field office in Delhi.",
      "Ms Vajpeyi believes the books-for-grain deal had a positive outcome. She studied Sanskrit, but her research in University of Chicago spanned Indian and European languages -  French, German, Marathi, and Hindi - and touched on linguistics, literature, philosophy, anthropology, and more. \"At the Regenstein Library, I never failed to find the books I needed or get them quickly if they weren't already there,\" she says.",
      "\"The books are safe, valued, accessible and used. I've visited libraries, archives and institutions in every part of India and the story in our country is universally dismal. Here they were lost or destroyed or neglected or very often made inaccessible.\""

      "Lee Jeong-hyun, the chief of the Muan fire department, told a televised briefing that the tail section of the plane was identifiable but \"one cannot recognise the shape of the rest of the plane\".",
      "He said that the bird strike and bad weather may have caused the crash - but that the exact cause is still being investigated. The flight and voice recorders from the plane have been recovered, though the Yonhap news agency reported that the former was damaged.",

      "He added: \"A lot of things about this tragedy don't make sense.\"",
      "What is a bird strike?",
      "A bird strike is a collision between a plane in flight and a bird. They are very common - in the UK, there were more than 1,400 bird strikes reported in 2022, only about 100 of which affected the plane, according to data from the Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "The best known bird strike occurred in 2009, when an Airbus plane made an emergency landing on New York's Hudson River after colliding with a flock of geese. All 155 passengers and crew survived.",
      "Professor Doug Drury, who teaches aviation at CQUniversity Australia, wrote in an article for The Conversation this summer that Boeing planes have turbofan engines, which can be severely damaged in a bird strike.",
      "He said that pilots are trained to be especially vigilant during the early morning or at sunset, when birds are most active.",
      "But some aviation experts are sceptical about whether a bird strike could have caused the crash at Muan Airport.",
      "\"Typically they [bird strike] don't cause the loss of an airplane by themselves,\" Mr Thomas told Reuters.",
      "Australian airline safety expert Geoffrey Dell also told the news agency: \"I've never seen a bird strike prevent the landing gear from being extended.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 23:07:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The wild success of K-entertainment - from pop hits to mushy dramas - has been in the making for years.",
    "story": [
      "Evan Barringer was 14 years old when he stumbled onto Full House, a South Korea romcom where two strangers are forced to share a house.",
      "Sitting in his house in Memphis, he hit play assuming it was an Asian remake of a beloved American sitcom from the 1980s. It wasn\u2019t until the third episode that he realised they had nothing in common save the name. But he was hooked.",
      "That accidental choice changed his life. Twelve years on, he is an English teacher in South Korea - and he says he loves it here: \u201cI have got to try all the foods I\u2019ve seen in K-dramas, and I\u2019ve gotten to see several of the K-pop artists in concerts whose lyrics I used to study Korean.\u201d",
      "When Evan discovered Full House in 2012, South Korean entertainment was a blip in the world\u2019s eye. Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style was the best-known Korean pop export at the time.",
      "Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that\u2019s four times the population of South Korea. Squid Game, Netflix's most popular show ever, has just returned for a much-anticipated second season.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The so-called Korean Wave swept the world, experts say, when the success of streaming met American-inspired production value. And Korean entertainment \u2013 from pop music and mushy dramas to acclaimed hits built around universal themes \u2013 was ready for it.",
      "No more 'Candy girls': The powerful women breaking K-drama barriers",
      "\u2018I lost nine teeth filming Squid Game\u2019: BBC on set with show\u2019s director",
      "BTS and Blackpink are now familiar names on the global pop circuit. People are swooning over sappy K-dramas from Dubai to India to Singapore. Overseas sales of all this Korean content - including video games - is now worth billions.",
      "Last month, after 53-year-old poet and novelist Han Kang won the Nobel Prize for her literature, online boards were full of memes noting South Korea\u2019s \u201cCulture Victory\u201d \u2014 a reference to the popular video game series Civilisation.",
      "And there were jokes about how the country had achieved the dream of founding father Kim Koo, who famously wrote that he wished for Korea to be a nation of culture rather than might.",
      "As it turns out, this moment had been in the making for years.",
      "It's all in the timing",
      "After South Korea\u2019s military dictatorship ended in 1987, censorship was loosened and numerous TV channels launched. Soon, there was a generation of creators who had grown up idolising Hollywood and hip-hop, says Hye Seung Chung, associate professor of Korean Film Studies at the University of Buffalo.",
      "Around the same time, South Korea rapidly grew rich, benefitting from an export boom in cars and electronics. And money from conglomerates, or chaebols as they are known, flowed into film and TV production, giving it a Hollywood-like sheen.",
      "They came to own much of the industry, from production to cinemas. So they were willing to splurge on making movies without worrying much about losses, Prof Chung says.",
      "K-pop, meanwhile, had become a domestic rage in the mid-90s, propelling the success of groups such as HOT and Shinhwa.",
      "This inspired agencies to replicate the gruelling Japanese artist management system.",
      "Scout young talent, often in their teens, and sign them onto years-long contracts through which they become \u201cperfect\u201d idols, with squeaky clean images and hyper-managed public personas. As the system took hold, it transformed K-pop, creating more and more idols.",
      "By the 2000s, Korean TV shows and K-pop were a hit in East and South East Asia. But it was streaming that took them to the world, and into the lives of anyone with a smartphone.",
      "That\u2019s when the recommendation engine took over \u2013 it has been key in initiating Korean culture fans, taking them from one show to the next, spanning different genres and even platforms.",
      "The alien and the familiar",
      "Evan says he binged the 16 hour-long episodes of Full House. He loved the way it took its time to build the romance, from bickering banter to attraction, unlike the American shows he knew.",
      "\u201cI was fascinated by each cultural difference I saw - I noticed that they don\u2019t wear shoes in the house,\u201d he recalls. So he took up Netflix\u2019s suggestions for more Korean romcoms. Soon, he found himself humming to the soundtracks of the shows, and was drawn to K-pop.",
      "He has now begun watching variety shows, a reality TV genre where comedians go through a series of challenges together.",
      "As they work their way through the recommendations, fans are immersed in a world that feels foreign yet familiar \u2013 one that eventually includes kimchi jiggae, a spicy kimchi stew, and kalguksu, a seafood and kelp noodle broth.",
      "When Mary Gedda first visited South Korea, she went looking for a bowl of kimchi jjigae, as she had seen the stars do on screen numerous times.",
      "\u201cI was crying [as I ate it]. It was so spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, why did I order this? They eat it so easily in every show.\u201d",
      "Mary, an aspiring French actor, now lives in Seoul. Originally a K-pop fan, she then discovered K-dramas and learned Korean. She has starred in a few cameo roles as well. \u201cI got lucky and I absolutely love it,\u201d she says.",
      "For Mary, food was a big part of the appeal because she saw such a variety of it on K-dramas. Seeing how characters build relationships over food was familiar to her, she says, because she grew up in the French countryside in Burgundy.",
      "But there is also the promise of romance, which drew Marie Namur to South Korea from her native Belgium. She began watching K-dramas on a whim, after visiting South Korea, but she says she kept going because she was \u201cpretty much attracted to all those beautiful Korean men\u201d.",
      "\"[They] are impossible love stories between a super-rich guy and a girl who is usually poor, and, you know, the guy is there to save her and it really sells you a dream.\"",
      "But it is Korean women who are writing most of these shows \u2013 so it is their imagination, or fantasy, that is capturing the interest (and hearts) of other women across the world.",
      "In Seoul, Marie said she was \u201ctreated like a lady\u201d, which hadn\u2019t happened \u201cin a very long time\u201d, but her \u201cdating experience is not exactly as I expected it to be\u201d.",
      "\u201cI do not want to be a housewife. I want to keep working. I want to be free. I want to go clubbing with my girlfriends if I want to, even though I'm married or in a relationship, and a lot of guys here do not want that.\u201d",
      "International fans are often looking for an alternative world because of disappointment with their own society, Prof Chung says.",
      "The prim romances, with handsome, caring and chivalrous heroes, are drawing a female audience turning away from what they see as hypersexual American entertainment. And when social inequality became a stronger theme in Korean films and shows - such as Parasite and Squid Game \u2013 it attracted global viewers disillusioned with capitalism and a yawning wealth divide in their countries.",
      "The pursuit of a global audience has brought challenges as well. The increasing use of English lyrics in K-pop has led to some criticism.",
      "And there is now a bigger spotlight on the industry's less glamorous side. The immense pressure stars face to be perfect, for instance, and the demands of a hyper-competitive industry. Creators behind blockbuster shows have alleged exploitation and complained about not being fairly compensated.",
      "Still, it\u2019s great to see the world pay attention to Korea, Prof Chung says. She grew up in a repressive South Korea, when critics of the government were regularly threatened or even killed. She escaped into American movies.",
      "When Parasite played in the cinema of the small American town where she lives, she saw on the faces of other moviegoers the same awe she felt as a child watching Hollywood films: \u201cIt feels so great that our love is returned.\u201d",

      "I was working as a producer in the BBC's Moscow bureau. Suddenly there was breaking news: Russia's President Boris Yeltsin had stepped down.",
      "His decision to resign took everyone by surprise, including the British press corps in Moscow. When the news broke there was no correspondent in the office. That meant I had to step in to write and broadcast my first BBC dispatch.",
      "\"Boris Yeltsin always said he would see out his full term in office,\" I wrote. \"Today he told Russians he'd changed his mind.\"",
      "It was the start of my career as a reporter.",
      "And the start of Vladimir Putin's as Russia's leader.",
      "Following Yeltsin's resignation, in accordance with the Russian constitution, Prime Minister Putin became acting president. Three months later he won the election.",
      "On leaving the Kremlin, Yeltsin's parting instruction to Putin was: \"Take care of Russia!\"",
      "I've found myself recalling these words of Yeltsin more and more, the closer Russia's war on Ukraine gets to the three-year mark.",
      "That's because President Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had devastating consequences.",
      "Primarily for Ukraine, which has seen massive destruction and casualties in its cities. Almost 20% of its territory has been occupied and 10 million of its citizens have been displaced.",
      "But for Russia, too:",

      "I often wonder whether the course of history would have been drastically different if Yeltsin had picked someone else to succeed him. The question, of course, is academic. History is full of ifs and buts and maybes.",

      "\"I think that Vladimir Putin has a very thin skin and a huge ambition for his country. The Soviet Union was recognised as the second superpower in the world. Russia can't make any claims in that direction. And I think that ate away at his ego.\"",
      "That is one possible explanation for the change we've seen in Putin: his burning ambition to \"Make Russia Great Again\" (and to make up for what many perceive as Moscow's defeat in the Cold War) put Russia on an inevitable collision course with its neighbours \u2013 and with the West.",
      "The Kremlin has a different explanation.",
      "From the speeches he gives, the comments he makes, Putin appears driven by resentment, by an all-encompassing feeling that for years Russia has been lied to and disrespected, its security concerns dismissed by the West.",
      "But does Putin himself believe that he has fulfilled Yeltsin's request to \"take care of Russia?\"",
      "I recently had a chance to find out.",
      "More than four hours into his lengthy end-of-year press conference, Putin invited me to ask a question.",
      "\"Boris Yeltsin told you to take care of Russia,\" I reminded the president. \"But what of the significant losses in your so-called 'special military operation', the Ukrainian troops in Kursk region, the sanctions, the high inflation. Do you think you've taken care of your country?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" President Putin replied. \"And I haven't just taken care of it. We've pulled back from the edge of the abyss.\"",
      "He portrayed Yeltsin's Russia as a country that had been losing its sovereignty. He accused the West of having \"patronisingly patted\" Yeltsin on the shoulder while \"using Russia for its own purposes\". But he, Putin, was \"doing everything\", he said, \"to ensure Russia was an independent sovereign state\".",
      "Presenting himself as the defender of Russian sovereignty: is this a view he's come up with retrospectively to try to justify the war in Ukraine? Or does Putin really believe this take on modern Russian history?",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 01:56:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Women-led Indian films have made a splash across the world this year, including at major festivals.",
    "story": [
      "In 2024, as Bollywood struggled to find its footing, smaller films by Indian women that told nuanced stories made headlines in the country and across the world.",
      "In May, Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light made history by winning the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival.",
      "In the months since then, All We Imagine As Light has become a juggernaut of indie cinema, sweeping through film festivals and the awards circuit. It has been judged the Best International film by prestigious associations including the New York Film Critics Circle and the Toronto Film Critics Association. It has also picked up two Golden Globe nominations, including for Ms Kapadia as best director.",
      "It is also on several best films of the year list, including that of the BBC and the New York Times.",
      "And it has company.",
      "Director Shuchi Talati's coming-of-age drama Girls Will Be Girls won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies (Lost Ladies) spent at least two months on the top 10 list of Netflix in India and was picked as the country's official Oscar entry (a controversial decision). Laapataa Ladies didn't make it to the Academy's shortlist. What did make it was British-Indian director Sandhya Suri's Hindi film Santosh, which had been picked as the UK's submission to the Oscars.",
      "Is this sudden wave of success for Indian films an aberration or a long-awaited shift in global consciousness?",
      "\"It's a culmination of both,\" says film critic Shubhra Gupta, pointing out that these films were not \"made overnight\".",
      "For instance, Shuchi Talati, the director of Girls Will Be Girls, and its co-producer Richa Chadha were in college together when they first came up with the idea for the film. \"They have been working on it for years,\" Gupta says.",
      "\"It's pure serendipity that 2024 became the year these films were released, igniting conversations together.\"",
      "This fortunate alignment has been a cinematic dream. The global impact of these films is rooted in their quality and exploration of universal themes like loneliness, relationships, identity, gender and resilience. With strong female voices and unconventional feminist narratives, these stories venture into territories unexplored by mainstream Indian cinema.",
      "In All We Imagine As Light, a film made in the Hindi, Marathi and Malayalam languages, three migrant women in Mumbai navigate empathy, resilience and human connection. The narrative delves into themes of loneliness and the socio-political landscape, notably the scrutiny of interfaith Hindu-Muslim relationships as seen with the character Anu (Divya Prabha) and her bond with Shiaz (Hridhu Haroon).",
      "Kapadia told the BBC that while the women in her films are financially independent, they still face limitations in their personal lives, particularly when it comes to matters of love.",
      "\"For me, love in India is very political\u2026 women seem to hold a lot of the so-called honour of the family and the protection of the caste lineage. So if she marries somebody who is of a different religion or of a different caste, that becomes an issue. For me, it is really a method to control women and infantilise them,\" she says.",
      "Talati's Girls Will Be Girls explores female adolescence, rebellion and intergenerational conflict through the story of a 16-year-old girl studying at a strict boarding school in the Himalayas and her fractured relationship with her mother, Anila, who struggles with her own vulnerabilities and unresolved emotions.",
      "\"It is the kind of coming-of-age film that we don't do in India at all,\" Gupta says. \"It looks at women from a very empathetic, very warm gaze.\"",
      "\"The age where people experience emotions with and without their bodies, their minds, that exploration but without infantilising the experience - it was never part of Indian mainstream cinema,\" she adds.",
      "Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies did not perform well at the box-office but got warm reviews from viewers and critics. At a BAFTA screening in London this month, Ms Rao described the current moment as \"really special for women from India\", expressing hope for a continued wave of such stories.",
      "Her film is a satirical comedy about two newlywed brides getting accidentally swapped on a train because of their veils. It offers a sharp commentary on patriarchy, identity and gender roles, a shift from decades of male-centred mainstream Indian films.",
      "\"A lot of us who are very patriarchal in our thinking are often that way because that's how we have been brought up,\" Bollywood star Aamir Khan, a co-producer of the film, said after the screening. \"But we need to be understanding, at least try and help each other even to come out of this kind of thinking.\"",
      "The biggest surprise this year came from the UK, which selected the Hindi-language film Santosh, directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, as its Oscar entry. Shot entirely in India over a 44-day schedule, it featured a largely female crew. Starring Indian actors Shahana Goswami and Sunita Rajbhar, Santosh was co-produced by people and companies across the UK, India, Germany and France.",
      "The film is intrinsically an Indian story about violence against women, set as a taut thriller.",
      "Goswami says the success of Santosh and All We Imagine as Light points to the merging of borders and expansion of film industries, creating space for cross-pollination and exchange.",
      "\"We often think these Indian films require [specific] cultural context, but they don't. Any film driven by emotion will resonate universally, regardless of its origins,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Three of the films - All We Imagine as Light, Girls Will Be Girls and Santosh - share one more common trait: they are cross-country co-productions.",
      "Goswami agrees that this could this be a formula for the future.",
      "\"With a French producer, for example, a film gains the opportunity to be seen by a French audience who may follow that producer or the broader film industry. This is how it becomes more globally accessible and relevant,\" she says.",
      "Even in Bollywood, some women-led films have had huge success this year. Stree 2, a horror-comedy about a mysterious woman battling a monster who abducts free-thinking women, was the year's second-biggest hit, playing in cinemas for months.",
      "On streaming platforms, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's opulent Netflix series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, an exploration of the misogyny and exploitation in the lives of courtesans in pre-independent India, was among Google's top-searched TV shows of the year.",
      "Their success seems to signal a growing appetite for such stories, their broad appeal demonstrating that mainstream cinema can address important themes without sacrificing entertainment value.",
      "Despite systemic challenges, 2024 has highlighted the global power of female voices from India and the demand for diverse stories. The momentum could be crucial for the Indian film industry in getting wider distribution for its independent films and pave the way for a more diverse and equitable film landscape."

    "summary": "Salome Zourabichvili's term is due to end on Sunday, but she says she is her country's last legitimate institution.",
    "story": [
      "Salome Zourabichvili's family fled Georgia in 1921 after Soviet forces snuffed out the country's three-year experiment with independence from Russia.",
      "A century later, Georgia's pro-Western president is refusing to leave office, arguing she is the last legitimate institution in her country.",
      "On Sunday, her six-year term as president is due to end. According to a new system for selecting the head of state, on that day she will be replaced by former Manchester City footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili, chosen with the support of the governing Georgian Dream party.",
      "Zourabichvili, 72, has denounced his election under an electoral college system in which he was the only candidate as a travesty.",
      "When she became president in 2018 she was endorsed by Georgian Dream, but she has since condemned their contested election victory in late October as a \"Russian special operation\" and backed nightly pro-EU protests outside parliament.",
      "The government says if she refuses to leave office she will be committing a crime.",
      "If she is forced out, she says the ruling party's takeover of the state will be complete and Georgia will have surrendered its sovereignty to a party that she accuses of serving Moscow.",
      "'A mythical place'",
      "Salome Zourabichvili was born in France in 1952 into a prominent family of Georgian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Her grandfather, a minister in the government of briefly independent Georgia, fled to France in 1921.",
      "Georgia, then under Soviet rule, loomed large in her childhood. It was a \"mythical place, which only existed in books,\" she said in a 2004 interview.",
      "Though raised in a culturally Georgian environment, speaking the language at home and attending Georgian Orthodox church services, she easily integrated into French culture. She attended France's elite schools, including Sciences Po, traditionally a feeder for the country's top public servants.",
      "She excelled, serving as a French diplomat for nearly 30 years. But throughout, her true passion remained in extricating her parents' mysterious country of origin from Russia's influence and bringing it closer to the West.",
      "\"She sees it as her life's mission to bring Georgia into Europe. Everything else for her has always been secondary,\" said Alexandre Crevaux-Asatiani, a former Zourabichvili aide.",
      "In 2003, she was appointed French ambassador to Georgia. A year later, she was granted Georgian citizenship and made foreign minister under President Mikheil Saakashvili. Dismissed in 2005, she took an increasingly prominent role in her adopted country's politics, founding a new party.",
      "Saakashvili's rule ended in 2012 and Georgian Dream have been in power ever since. The party's founder, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, is widely seen by Georgians as the most powerful man in their country. By a quirk of fate, he is also French, having taken citizenship in 2010.",
      "Backed for the presidency by Ivanishvili's party, Zourabichvili was initially unpopular among the country's pro-Western youth. A popular TV show mocked her halting Georgian, spoken with a strong French accent.",
      "She was seen as aligned with the ruling party, unpopular with many young people, and she blamed a short war with Russia in 2008 on Georgia allowing itself to be provoked.",
      "But as her presidential term progressed, Georgian Dream took an increasingly authoritarian and anti-Western turn, cracking down on civil society and NGOs. It refused to join Western sanctions on Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and called the West the \"global war party\", making a mockery of its stated aim of joining the EU and Nato.",
      "Zourabichvili openly defied the government, believing she had the support of the majority of Georgia's population.",
      "She pledged to veto a bill on \"foreign influence\" that mirrored Russian legislation passed under President Vladimir Putin, but the government passed it anyway, defying weeks of protests.",
      "\"The choice for Georgia is between independence or slavery, Europe or Russia,\" she said in April.",
      "She has often addressed the protesters who have turned out every night for a month outside parliament, casting them as the conscience of the nation against a Russia-friendly government.",
      "Last month she asked riot police, accused by the opposition of brutalising protesters: \"Are you serving Russia or Georgia?\"",
      "Many protesters, initially distrustful of the president for coming to power with Georgian Dream's backing, came to respect her outspoken opposition.",
      "\"No-one expected her to be this good. She reflects our values,\" said Irakli, a 34-year-old who has been regularly demonstrating. \"She motivates us to fight.\"",
      "Ahead of October's contested elections, the government tried to impeach her for meeting EU leaders without government authorisation. Ultimately the effort failed but it was an indication of the showdown to come.",
      "Zourabichvili called the elections, which returned Georgian Dream to power, \"totally falsified\". She backed opposition parties' calls for a re-run, drawing the ire of senior party leaders.",
      "'Let's see where she ends up'",
      "She now faces perhaps her biggest challenge so far, as Georgian Dream prepares to install her replacement, Mikheil Kavelashvili, as president.",
      "But Zourabichvili has insisted she will not go, setting up a likely constitutional crisis. Georgian Dream Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has threatened her with arrest.",
      "\"Let's see where she ends up, behind bars or outside,\" he told reporters this week.",
      "The government is likely to force her to leave one way or another, said Petre Tsiskarishvili of the opposition United National Movement.",
      "Conscious of not wanting to make her a political martyr and elevate her profile further, it may avoid a high-profile arrest, he added, perhaps merely locking her out of her official residence at the Orbeliani Palace.",
      "Doubts towards her will persist. Some in the opposition blame her for providing a pro-European face to Georgian Dream's authoritarian turn for far too long, refraining from criticising Ivanishvili until only a few months ago.",
      "But in a country where pro-European forces have often been fractured, Zourabichvili's supporters say she is likely to emerge from her term in office as a key opponent to the government.",
      "\"Even if she is arrested, she will still be considered the legitimate president of Georgia. There is no question about it,\" said Mr Crevaux-Asatiani, the president's former aide.",

      "\"I feel that when he saw this, he felt that this [was] closure,\" she adds. \"Now we want people to hear what Syrians went through.\"",
      "Abdullah, 36, was working in Damascus as a store keeper with the International Committee of the Red Cross in July 2013 when he and his colleagues were stopped at a checkpoint on the outskirts of the Syrian capital.",
      "He says he participated in anti-regime protests in 2011 in the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad began, but soon distanced himself when rebels began to use violence and weapons in response to a brutal crackdown by the regime's forces.",
      "Abdullah was singled out at the checkpoint and put on a green bus, handcuffed and blindfolded, and taken to a military area. He says he was then put in solitary confinement for three days and beaten.",
      "\"It was so dark for three days, I remember,\" he says.",
      "\"I don't [hear] any sound. It was so dark. You hear nothing. You feel so lonely.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "A man of few words, Manmohan Singh led the country from the front - but was deeply misunderstood along the way.",
    "story": [
      "The prospect of a shy politician is somewhat hard to imagine. Unless that politician is Manmohan Singh.",
      "Since the death of the former Indian prime minister on Thursday, much has been said about the \"kind and soft-spoken politician\" who changed the course of Indian history and impacted the lives of millions.",
      "His state funeral is being held on Saturday and India's government has announced an official mourning period of seven days.",
      "Despite an illustrious career - he was governor of India's central bank and federal finance minister before becoming a two-term prime minister - Singh never came across as a big-stage politician, lacking the public swagger of many of his peers.",
      "Though he gave interviews and held news conferences, especially in his first term as prime minister, he chose to stay quiet even when his government was mired in scandals or when his cabinet ministers faced corruption allegations.",
      "His gentlemanly ways were both deplored and adored in equal measure.",
      "His admirers said he was careful not to pick unnecessary battles or make lofty promises and that he focused on results - perhaps best exemplified by the pro-market reforms he ushered in as finance minister which opened India's economy to the world.",
      "\"I don't think anyone in India believes that Manmohan Singh can do something wrong or corrupt,\" his  former colleague in the Congress party, Kapil Sibal, once said,. \"He was extremely cautious, and he always wanted to be on the right side of the law.\"",
      "His opponents, on the other hand, mocked him, saying he exhibited a kind of fuzziness unsuitable for a politician, let alone the premier of a country of more than one billion people. His voice - husky and breathless, almost like a tired whisper - often became the butt of jokes.",
      "But the same voice was also endearing to many who found him relatable in a world of politics where high-pitched and high-octane speeches were the norm.",
      "Singh's image as a media-shy, unassuming, introverted politician never left him, even when his contemporaries, including his own party members, went through dramatic cycles of reinvention.",
      "Yet, it was the dignity with which he manoeuvred each situation - even the difficult ones - that made him so memorable.",
      "Born to a poor family in what is now Pakistan, Singh was India's first Sikh prime minister. His personal story - of a Cambridge and Oxford-educated economist who overcame insurmountable odds to rise up the ranks - coupled with his image of an honest and thoughtful leader, had already made him a hero to India's middle classes.",
      "But in 2005, he surprised everyone when he made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which around 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "The riots, in which several Congress party members were accused, broke out after the assassination of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. One of them later said they shot the Congress politician to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar.",
      "It was a bold move - no other prime minister, including from the Congress party, had gone so far as to offer an apology. But it provided a healing touch to the Sikh community and politicians across party lines respected him for the courageous act.",
      "A few years later, in 2008, Singh's understated style of leadership received more praise after he signed a landmark deal with the US that ended India's decades-long nuclear isolation, allowing India access to nuclear technology and fuel for the first time since it held tests in 1974.",
      "The deal was massively criticised by opposition leaders and Singh's own allies, who feared it would compromise India's foreign policy. Singh, however, managed to salvage both his government and the deal.",
      "The period 2008-2009 also witnessed global financial turmoil but Singh's policies were credited for shielding India from it.",
      "In 2009, he led his party to a resounding victory and returned as the PM for a second term, cementing his image of a benevolent leader, or rather, the exciting idea that leaders could be benevolent.",
      "For many, he had become virtue personified, the \"reluctant prime minister\" who stayed clear of the spotlight and refused to make any dramatic gestures, but was also not afraid of taking bold decisions for the sake of his country's future.",
      "Then, things began to unravel.",
      "A string of corruption allegations - first around the hosting of the Commonwealth Games, then the illegal allocation of coal fields - plagued the Congress party and Singh's government. Some of these corruption allegations were later found to be untrue or exaggerated. Some cases from the period are still pending in courts.",
      "But Singh had already begun to feel some pressure. During his tenure, he made several attempts at reconciliation with India's arch rival neighbour Pakistan, hoping for a thaw in the decades-old frosty relations.",
      "The approach was sharply questioned in 2008 when a terror attack led by a Pakistan-based terror group killed 171 people in Mumbai city.",
      "The 60-hour siege, one of the bloodiest in the country's history, opened a chasm of allegations, as the opposition blamed the government's \"soft stance\" on terrorism for the tragedy.",
      "In the coming years, other decisions Singh made badly backfired.",
      "In 2011, an anti-corruption movement led by social activist Anna Hazare shook up Singh's government. The frail 72-year-old became an icon for the middle classes, as he demanded stringent anti-corruption laws in the country.",
      "As a middle-class hero himself, Singh was expected to deal with Hazare's demands more perceptively. Instead, the prime minister tried to quash the movement, allowing the police to arrest Hazare and disband his demonstration.",
      "The move stoked a wave of public and media hostility against him. Those who once admired his understated style wondered if they had misjudged the politician and began to see his quiet ways through a less generous lens.",
      "The feeling was heightened the next year when Singh refused to comment on the horrific gang rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi for more than a week.",
      "To make things worse, India's economic growth was slowing. Corruption grew and jobs shrank, sparking waves of public anger. And Singh's unassuming personality, which once made his every move seem like a revelation, was labelled as showing complacency, diffidence and even arrogance by some.",
      "Yet, Singh never tried to defend or explain himself and faced the criticism quietly.",
      "That was until 2014. At a rare news conference, he announced that he would not seek a third term in office.",
      "But he also tried to set the record straight. \"I honestly believe that history will judge me more kindly than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament did, \" he said, after listing some of the biggest accomplishments of his tenure.",
      "He was right.",
      "As it turned out, neither the Congress, nor Singh, could entirely recover from the damage as they lost the general elections to the BJP. But despite the many hurdles, Singh's image as a kind and discerning leader stayed with him.",
      "Throughout his prime ministerial stint and despite a second term plagued by controversies, he maintained an aura of personal dignity and integrity.",
      "His policies were seen to centre around the middle class and the poor - he approved manifold increase in salaries of central employees, kept inflation in check and introduced landmark schemes on educations and jobs.",
      "It may not have been enough to elevate him from the quandaries of politics or shield him from some of the failures of his career.",
      "But there was more to his shyness; he was a leader of steely resolve."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 02:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Carmen Souza's latest album is inspired by the little-known British influence on the Cape Verde islands.",
    "story": [
      "When she was a young child and taking too long to get ready for school, family get-togethers or to sing in the church choir, Cape Verdean musician Carmen Souza was often told to \"ariope\".",
      "What she did not realise until years later was that the Creole word came directly from the English word \"hurry up\".",
      "\"We have so many words that derive from the British English,\" Souza, a jazz singer-songwriter and instrumentalist, tells the BBC.",
      "\"'Salong' is 'so long', 'fulespide' is 'full speed', 'streioei' is 'straightaway', 'bot' is 'boat', and 'ariope' - which I always remember my father saying to me when he wanted me to pick up my pace.\"",
      "Ariope is now one of eight songs that Souza has composed for the album Port'Ingl\u00eas - meaning English port - to explore the little-known history of the 120-year-old British presence in Cape Verde. It started off as research for her master's degree.",
      "\"Cape Verdeans are very connected to music - in fact, we always say that music is our biggest export - and so I wondered whether there was also a musical impact,\" she says.",
      "There are very few recordings of compositions of the time - Souza did discover that an American ethnomusicologist, Helen Heffron Roberts, recorded some in the 1930s but they are on very fragile wax cylinders and can only be listened to in person at Yale University in the US.",
      "So rather than rearranging old recordings, Souza - and her musical partner Theo Pas'cal - created new music, inspired by stories she came across.",
      "She has combined jazz and English sea shanties with Cape Verdean rhythms - including the funan\u00e1, played on an iron rod with a knife and the accordion, and the batuque, played by women and based on African drumming rhythms.",
      "The Cape Verdean islands lie about 500km (310 miles) off the coast of West Africa. They are mostly arid, with limited arable land and prone to drought.",
      "But they are a strategic midway point in the Atlantic Ocean, and they were first controlled by the Portuguese as they traded between south-east Asia, Europe and the Americas - in spices, silk and enslaved people. With the abolition of the slave trade, Cape Verde went into decline.",
      "Cape Verde remained a Portuguese colony until 1975 - but during the 18th and 19th Centuries, British merchants settled and Cape Verde once again became a bustling crossroads.",
      "The British came for the cheap labour, goats, donkeys, salt, turtles, amber and archil, a special ink that was used in British clothes manufacturing.",
      "They built roads, bridges and developed the natural ports - which became known as Port'Ingl\u00eas - and set up coaling stations, with coal brought in from Wales.",
      "S\u00e3o Vicente's Mindelo port became a vital refuelling stop for steamships carrying goods across the Atlantic Ocean or to Africa - and an important global communications hub with the 1875 arrival of a submarine cable station.",
      "Souza's exploration of the British presence in Cape Verde quickly became personal.",
      "\"As I started to research, I found so many personal connections,\" Souza says - including the fact that her grandfather loaded coal on to ships in Mindelo.",
      "That inspired her to write Ariope - the story of an older man urging a younger man, who prefers to stay in the shade playing his guitar, to \"ariope\". The British ships are coming and the sailors do not like to wait - \"fulespide, streioei\", the song goes.",
      "Souza imagines the spirit of her grandfather in the song. He used to play the fiddle - and was known as a great storyteller.",
      "\"I was told that if you had to walk with him for kilometres, you wouldn't notice the distance because it would be one funny story after another.\"",
      "Souza is part of Cape Verde's large diaspora. She was born in Portugal, and now lives in London. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are about 700,000 Cape Verdeans living abroad - twice as many as at home.",
      "Historically, people were forced to move for work because of famine, drought, poverty and lack of opportunities.",
      "This movement contributed to the islands' deep, rich tradition of strongly distinctive music, including the melancholic morna made famous by singer Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora and declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco in 2019.",
      "The composer behind many of the songs that made \u00c9vora a global star was Francisco Beleza - also known as B L\u00e9za. He revolutionised morna and was one of Cape Verde's most influential writers, composers and morna singers.",
      "According to Souza's research, he also considered the British presence to be more beneficial than the Portuguese - at least to middle-class Cape Verdeans.",
      "Souza's track Amizadi, a mix of funan\u00e1 and jazz, was inspired by B L\u00e9za's admiration of the British. He composed a morna - Hitler ca ta ganha guerra, ni nada, meaning \"Hitler will not win the war\" to show solidarity with the British people during World War II - and even raised money for the British war effort.",
      "Souza found that ports were \"an important hub for musicians\" who flocked there to learn the music - and instruments - of visiting foreign sailors.",
      "They blended them with Cape Verdean rhythms to create new sounds. The mazurka - derived from a Polish musical form - and contradan\u00e7a from the British quadrille dance.",
      "Early written records of Cape Verdean music are scarce - the Portuguese colonists did not document life and society on Cape Verde other than records of taxes and commodities.",
      "They also banned the batuque - for being too noisy and too African - and funan\u00e1 because its lyrics challenged social inequalities.",
      "But Souza found an intriguing entry in the diary of British naturalist Charles Darwin, who arrived in Cape Verde in 1832 - the first stop on his famous Beagle voyage to study the living world.",
      "He describes an encounter with a group of about 20 young women who, writes Darwin, \"sung with great energy a wild song, beating with their hands upon their legs\".",
      "That, says Souza, is most probably an early performance of batuque - and she was inspired to write the song Sant Jago by Darwin's accounts of the warm hospitality he received on Cape Verde.",
      "Many younger Cape Verdean musicians tend not to play the islands' older rhythms, and some like the contradan\u00e7a are slowly dying out.",
      "Souza hopes that her Port'Ingl\u00eas album will inspire younger generations that \"there is a way to do something new with the traditional genres\".",
      "\"I always bring some different elements - improvisation, the piano, the flute, the jazz harmonisation - so that the music is going through another process of creolisation.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 07:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Under the burden of military service, some reservists are refusing to return to Israel's front lines.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s war on multiple fronts has not just worn down its enemy. It's not just taken the lives of thousands of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. It\u2019s also continuing to extract a price from its own people.",
      "There\u2019s a growing sense of war weariness in Israel. The recent ceasefire deal with Lebanon will be a relief for many. Not least for Noam Glukhovsky \u2013 an IDF reservist, who\u2019s spent much of the past year serving on the front line as a medic.",
      "We spoke to Noam, 33, in Tel Aviv before the ceasefire was announced. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this war for much longer. We just don\u2019t have the manpower to keep going on without a clear end date and goal,\u201d he said.",
      "As an IDF reservist Noam would normally expect to do a few weeks of military service a year. But this past year he\u2019s spent 250 days in uniform. The war, he said, had ripped him away from the life he knew. His plans to become a doctor have also been set back by a year.",
      "When we meet Noam was trying to catch up with his studies, but also waiting to see whether he\u2019d be called up again. His mood was defiant.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t put my life on hold anymore,\u201d he said. Unless there was a dramatic change in the direction of the war, he said he wouldn\u2019t be returning to his unit. He\u2019d had enough.",
      "The IDF already acknowledges that fewer reserves are now reporting for duty. After the attacks by Hamas on 7 October last year, which killed about 1,200 people, more than 300,000 reservists responded. Turnout exceeded 100%. Now it\u2019s down to 85%. Noam estimates that in his unit the response is even lower \u2013 with around 60% of those called up now reporting for duty.",
      "Reserves and conscripts are the lifeblood of the IDF. Brigadier General Ariel Heimann \u2013 also a reservist and a former chief reserve officer - says Israel is too small a country to have a large, expensive, professional, regular army. Without reservists, he says, the IDF wouldn\u2019t be able to fight or survive.",
      "According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the IDF has 170,000 active duty personnel, including conscripts, and 465,000 reserves.",
      "Brig Gen Heimann admits the IDF\u2019s reliance on reserves will become more challenging the longer the war goes on. He likened the IDF to a spring \u2013 if it\u2019s stretched too far it\u2019ll break. At the moment he says it\u2019s coping.",
      "But in a sign of the strain the IDF wants to extend mandatory service for male conscripts from 32 to 36 months.",
      "The fact that the burden of service is not being shared by all, has also fuelled a sense of resentment. One group has been exempt from military service for decades \u2013 thousands of Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, Jews. They believe the lives of their young men should be dedicated to religious studies not military service.",
      "The issue has already divided Israel\u2019s coalition government. But, following the intervention of the attorney general, call up papers are being sent to 7,000 Haredi Jewish men. They\u2019ve responded with angry protests. But Brig Gen Heimann, like the ousted former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, says they have a \u201cmoral duty to serve\u201d.",
      "There\u2019s not just a personal sacrifice required, but an economic one too.",
      "The Bank of Israel said in May that the cost of the war for Israel could reach $70bn (\u00a355bn) by the end of next year, an estimate made before the country's ground invasion of Lebanon. Small businesses are among the hardest hit.",
      "Shelly Lotan\u2019s food tech start-up is among many fighting for survival. Shelly\u2019s already had to move her business from northern Israel to avoid Hezbollah\u2019s rockets. Two of her seven employees have been called up for military service.",
      "On the morning we meet, at her Tel Aviv home, Shelly has just received more bad news. She\u2019s received a text from one of her staff whose military service is being extended.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t express how critical it is to have another employee missing for another month,\u201d says Shelly.",

      "Shelly\u2019s also had to juggle family life with three young children. Her husband, also a reservist, has had to spend long periods away from home.",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon may ease some of the pressure. But there\u2019s still fighting in Gaza. Shelly Lotan fears for the future without a clear strategy from Israel\u2019s government to end the conflict.",

    "summary": "Former Indian PM Manmohan Singh, who died on Thursday, led India through both good and bad times.",
    "story": [
      "People in India are reflecting on former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's contribution to the country since his death on Thursday evening.",
      "Singh, who held the top post for two consecutive terms between 2004 and 2014, was seen as an architect of India's economic liberalisation which changed the country's growth trajectory.",
      "The first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to return to power, Singh was also the first Sikh to assume the top office.",
      "Known as a soft-spoken technocrat, he had earlier headed India's central bank, served as a finance secretary and minister, and led the opposition in the upper house of parliament.",
      "Here are five milestones from Singh's life that shaped his career and had a lasting impact on more than a billion Indians.",
      "Economic liberalisation",
      "Singh was appointed finance minister in 1991 by the Congress party-led government under Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao.",
      "India's economy at the time was facing a serious financial crisis, with the country's foreign reserves at a dangerously low level, barely enough to pay for two weeks of imports.",
      "Singh led the initiative to deregulate the economy to avoid its collapse, which he argued was otherwise imminent. Despite stiff opposition from members of his government and party, Singh prevailed.",
      "He took bold measures that included devaluing the currency, reducing import tariffs and privatising state-owned companies.",
      "He was famously quoted as saying in parliament during his first budget speech in 1991 that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "Later, as prime minister, Singh continued to build on his economic reform measures, lifting millions of Indians out of poverty and contributing to India's rise as one of the world's fastest-growing major economies.",
      "Reluctant prime minister",
      "The Congress party made a comeback in 2004 elections, handing a surprise defeat to the government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "Congress chief Sonia Gandhi was widely expected to head the government, but many members of the outgoing ruling party raised questions over the fact that she was born in Italy. She declined to take up the post and instead proposed Singh's name, who was seen as a non-controversial, consensus candidate of great personal integrity.",
      "In the next parliamentary election, he helped his party win a bigger mandate, but critics often termed him a \"remote-controlled\" prime minister managed by the Gandhi family.",
      "Singh often refused to comment on such allegations and kept his focus on the job.",
      "He may have started his first stint as prime minister with some reluctance but he soon stamped his authority on the top job.",
      "Singh's tenure, particularly between 2004 and 2009, saw the country's GDP grow at a healthy average pace of around 8%, the second fastest among major economies.",
      "He took bold decisions on reforms and brought more foreign investment into the country. Experts credit him for shielding India from the 2008 global financial crisis.",
      "But his second term, in an alliance with a disparate group of parties, was marked by allegations of corruption against some of his cabinet ministers, though his personal integrity was never questioned.",
      "In response to these allegations, he told journalists in 2014 in his last press conference as prime minister that he hoped history would judge him differently.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he said.",
      "\"I think taking into account the circumstances and the compulsions of a coalition polity, I have done as best as I could do under the circumstances.\"",
      "Rights to education, information and identity",
      "As prime minister, Singh took several far-reaching decisions that continue to impact the health of Indian democracy even today.",
      "He introduced new laws that strengthened and guaranteed the right to seek information from the government, allowing citizens an extraordinary power to hold officials accountable.",
      "He also introduced a rural employment scheme which guaranteed livelihood for a minimum of 100 days, a measure economists said had a profound impact on rural incomes and poverty reduction.",
      "He also brought in a law that guaranteed the right to free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6 and 14, significantly reducing the school dropout rates.",
      "His government also introduced a unique identity project called Aadhar to improve financial inclusion and delivery of welfare benefits to the poor. The current federal government, run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has continued to keep Aadhar as a cornerstone for many of its policies.",
      "Apology for anti-Sikh riots",
      "In 1984, prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge a military action she had ordered against separatists hiding in Sikhism's holiest temple in northern India's Amritsar.",
      "Her death sparked massive violence that resulted in the death of more than 3,000 Sikhs and a widespread destruction of their property.",
      "Singh formally apologised to the nation in 2005 in parliament, saying the violence were \"the negation of the concept of nationhood enshrined in our constitution\".",
      "\"I have no hesitation in apologising to the Sikh community. I apologise not only to the Sikh community, but to the whole Indian nation,\" he said.",
      "No other prime minister, particularly from the Congress party, had gone this far to apologise in parliament for the riots.",
      "Deal with US",
      "Singh signed a historic deal with the US in 2008 to end India's nuclear isolation after its 1998 testing of the weapon system.",
      "His government argued that the deal wouldhelp meet India's growing energy needs and sustain its healthy growth rate.",
      "The deal, seen as a watershed moment in the India-US relations, promised to grant a waiver to India to commence civilian nuclear trade with the US and the rest of the world.",
      "But it faced massive opposition, with critics of the deal alleging that it would compromise India's sovereignty and independence in foreign policy. In protest, the Left Front withdrew support from the governing alliance.",
      "Singh, however, managed to save both his government and the deal."

    "title": "Elon Musk's 'social experiment on humanity': How X evolved in 2024",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",

      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carter's attorneys for comment.",
      "Combs remains jailed in New York awaiting a criminal trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He also faces a wave of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs.",
      "The lawsuits allege many individuals were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida after receiving drug-laced drinks.",
      "Combs' lawyers have dismissed Buzbee's lawsuits as \"shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\" Jay-Z has said in a statement that Buzbee is trying to blackmail him to settle the Alabama woman's allegations.",
      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",
      "Spiro asked the judge to dismiss the entertainer from the woman's lawsuit and he requested a hearing on the case for the day after he made his requests in writing on Dec. 18.",
      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story. For one thing, the woman said she traveled for five hours from Rochester to watch the music awards show on a jumbotron outside the VMAs even though permits and pictures show there was no jumbotron at the event.",

    "story": [
      "New Mexico prosecutors have dropped their appeal, ending an effort to\u00a0reinstate charges against Alec Baldwin in connection with the fatal shooting on the set of his movie \"Rust.\"",
      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",
      "David Halls, the film's safety coordinator, pleaded no contest last year to negligent use of a firearm. He completed six months of unsupervised parole."

      "The biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL's moves into streaming - Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the \"Sunday Ticket\" package moved to YouTube TV last year.",

      "Kansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed - which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs - with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record.",
      "Houston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 23:11:16 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

    "story": [
      "Manufacturers of baby powder and cosmetic products made with talc will have to test them for asbestos under a proposal announced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "The agency's proposal comes at the directive of Congress, which passed legislation requiring the FDA take action last year.\u00a0 A known human carcinogen, asbestos is found in the same rock types as talc deposits and may mingle in the mining process, potentially leading to contaminated products and raising concerns about the risks to the public.",
      "The FDA's proposed rule would require manufacturers test samples of talc-containing cosmetic products for asbestos with methods including polarized light and transmission electron microscopy, which lights up samples with an electron beam. Alternatively, companies could also rely on a certificate of analysis from their talc suppliers, the agency stated.",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\" Linda Katz, a medical doctor and director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said Thursday in a news\u00a0release announcing the agency's action.",
      "The agency's proposed rule falls short of a ban on talc, which advocates including U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, have\u00a0called for.",
      "Long-running litigation against Johnson & Johnson alleges the company's talc baby powder caused women to develop ovarian cancer. The company in June agreed to pay $700 million to settle allegations it misled people about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",

      "\"The Hidden Globe: How Wealth Hacks the World\" (Riverhead Books) makes a complex financial and legal subject clear, exciting \u2026 and deeply troubling.",

      "\"The Hidden Globe\" by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy may be advising President-elect Donald Trump on cutting federal spending\u00a0but they also have some advice for him about the U.S. workforce, urging his next administration to bring in more foreign tech workers.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy's views have sparked an online spat between factions of Trump's supporters over immigration and the tech industry, whose businesses rely on the H-1B visa to bring in thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers each year from India, China and other nations.",
      "The tech industry has long called for more H-1B visas to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S., although Trump's first administration restricted the program in 2020, arguing that it allows businesses to replace Americans with lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "That debate has again erupted after Musk, himself once on an H-1B visa and whose electric vehicle company Tesla has hired workers using the program, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers. Ramaswamy, for his part, wrote in an X post that American culture \"has venerated mediocrity over excellence,\" leading to a nation that does \"not produce the best engineers.\"",
      "\"There is a permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent. It is the fundamental limiting factor in Silicon Valley,\" Musk wrote on Dec. 25 on X, his social media app.",
      "Here's what to know about the debate and the H-1B visa.",
      "How did the most recent H-1B debate begin?",
      "The debate touched off this week when Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer\u00a0with a history of racist and conspiratorial comments, criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence policy in his coming administration. Krishnan favors the ability to bring more skilled immigrants into the U.S.",
      "Loomer declared the stance to be \"not America First policy\" and said the tech executives who have aligned themselves with Trump were doing so to enrich themselves.",
      "Loomer's comments sparked a back-and-forth with venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, whom Trump has tapped to be the \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\" Musk and Ramaswamy, whom Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut the federal government, defended the tech industry's need to bring in foreign workers.",
      "It bloomed into a larger debate with more figures from the hard right weighing in about the need to hire U.S. workers, whether values in American culture can produce the best engineers, free speech on the internet, the newfound influence tech figures have in Trump's world and what his political movement stands for.",
      "Who qualifies for an H-1B visa?",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says\u00a0the H-1B visa is geared toward professionals with a \"theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge,\" and who have a bachelor's degree or higher in their field.",
      "Those professionals also need to have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company, which must offer a wage that's not lower than that paid to similarly qualified workers or below the prevailing wage for the job in the geographic area where that person will be working.",
      "How many workers receive H-1B visas?",
      "The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be granted for those with a master's degree or higher, USCIS says. The visa is valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years beyond that.",
      "However, the U.S. approves extensions each year for people already working on H-1B visas, with a 2023 report noting that the agency granted the greenlight to more than 309,000 requests for continuing employment under the visa program.",
      "What countries do H-1B recipients come from?",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders stem from a wide range of nations, including Canada, Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a USCIS report.",
      "What's the debate about H-1B visas?",
      "Technology companies say H-1B visas for skilled workers, used by software engineers and others in the tech industry, are critical for hard-to-fill positions.",
      "But critics have said they undercut U.S. citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the program to be eliminated, not expanded.",
      "Some investigations, including a 2017\u00a0report from CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" have found that while many businesses use the program as intended, some have taken advantage of the visa program to replace American workers with less expensive temporary foreign workers.",
      "What does Donald Trump say about H-1B visas?",
      "Trump has not yet weighed in on the rift, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "But Trump's positions over the years have reflected the divide in his movement. His tough immigration policies, including his pledge for mass deportation, were central to his winning presidential campaign.",
      "He has focused on immigrants who come into the U.S. illegally but he has also sought curbs on legal immigration, including family-based visas.",

    "summary": "Federal officials say homelessness rose 18% in 2024, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing.",
    "story": [
      "Homelessness in the U.S. jumped 18.1% this year, hitting a record level, with the dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in some regions of the country, federal officials said Friday.",
      "More than 770,000 people were counted as homeless in federally required tallies taken across the country during a single night in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its new report.\u00a0The estimate likely undercounts the number of unhoused people given that it doesn't include people staying with friends or family because they don't have a place of their own.",
      "That jump comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time.",
      "Vulnerable Americans have been hard hit during the post-pandemic years as many government supports ended, including the eviction moratorium. At the same time, housing costs are surging, causing a record number of renters to be cost-burdened, or paying more than 30% of their income on housing,\u00a0according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.",
      "\"More people than ever need help paying rent. More people than ever are becoming homeless for the first time,\" the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit focused on preventing and ending homelessness, wrote on X in a post about the HUD report.",
      "The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population.",
      "\"No American should face homelessness,\" HUD Agency head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on \"evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\"",
      "However, because the report is based on data collected almost a year earlier, it may not accurately represent current circumstances, the statement added. For instance, unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have declined this year, after migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under President Joe Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December 2024.",
      "A rise in family homelessness",
      "Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness \u2014 one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities.",
      "Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year.",
      "Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count.",
      "\"Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,\" Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. \"As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.\"",
      "Bans on camping",
      "The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness.",
      "Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities \u2014 especially in Western states \u2014 have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don't violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness.",
      "There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024.",
      "\"The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,\" Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. \"With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide. Federal investments are critical in tackling the country's housing affordability crisis and ensuring that every American has access to safe, stable housing.\"",
      "Cities where homelessness is declining",
      "Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023.",
      "California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts.",
      "The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade.",
      "Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017.",

      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon that her agency will need to start taking \"extraordinary measures\" or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations. And the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic pushed up government borrowing costs such that debt service next year will exceed spending on national security.",

      "This holiday shopping season saw Americans stepping up their purchases at retail stores, with many chains luring shoppers with big Black Friday discounts. But with the holiday now over, retailers are beginning to roll out their post-Christmas sales, aiming to entice shoppers to spend more.",
      "Shoppers spent between $979.5 billion and $989 billion last month and in December, with retail sales up 2.5% to 3.5%\u00a0from a year ago, according to an estimate from the National Retail Federation, the nation's biggest retail trade group.",
      "Retailers are now looking to encourage more of the same in wrapping up the holidays with additional post-Christmas promotions. This year's shorter holiday shopping period placed pressure on some retailers, some of which also struggled to attract inflation-weary consumers through their doors.",
      "\"So far, post-Christmas discounts seem to be slightly bigger than last year,\" GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are working hard to stimulate demand and nudging consumers into spending.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, there is not a dramatic difference. A lot of retailers managed inventory well this year so they don't have loads of stuff left over that they need to shift.\"",
      "Budget-conscious shoppers have also found bargains during a particularly tough year\u00a0for some retailers, with store closures surging 69% versus a year earlier, according to research firm CoreSight.",
      "The industry's woes include the recent bankruptcy of popular chain Party City, now holding an \"All Stores Closing Sale!\" with everything going at a discount and up to 50% off. Along the same vein, Big Lots plans to host \"going out of business\" sales as its more than 900 locations after the company's sale to a private equity firm fell through earlier this month.",
      "Other national retailers are also holding sales, but tying them to the season. Here's a sampling.",
      "Do products usually go on sale after Christmas?",
      "Yes, retailers typically offer post-holiday sales to reduce inventory after Christmas. But this year, American shoppers have another reason to head to the malls or the computer in search of deals: the potential threat of higher prices on many goods if President-elect Donald Trump enacts tariffs on imports.",
      "Sticker-shocked consumers have in recent months seen some relief as inflation abated, but Trump's pledge to impose\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0on imports once back in the White House has some experts warning that prices could increase on a slew of goods in 2025, including made-in-China toys,\u00a0electronics\u00a0and even crude\u00a0oil imported\u00a0from Canada.",
      "For instance, Dallas-Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings is running a \"pre-tariff sale,\" predicting its prices would double once the import duties kick in, the company\u00a0posted\u00a0on Facebook.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:56:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, requires some businesses to register with FINCEN next month, or face fines. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's beneficial ownership information rule, or BOI?",
      "The reporting rule is the CTA's Beneficial Ownership Information reporting requirement, or BOI, which mandates small businesses to register the following with FinCEN, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

      "Here are other filing deadlines, depending on the date of a business' creation.",
      "Companies created on or after September 4, 2024 that had a filing deadline between December 3, 2024 and December 23, 2024 now have until January 13, 2025 to file with FinCEN.Businesses created or registered in the U.S. on or after Dec. 3, 2024 and on or before Dec. 23, 2024 have an extra 21 days from their original deadline to file with FinCEN.Those businesses that qualify for disaster relief may be have deadlines later than Jan. 13.

      "The penalties are up to $591 per day for failure to file, according to FinCEN.",
      "Businesses may also face criminal penalties of up to two years imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, the Chamber of Commerce notes.",
      "Which businesses are exempt from the CTA filing?",
      "There are 23 types of businesses that are exempt from the beneficial ownership information filing, according to the Chamber of Commerce. These include many publicly traded companies and nonprofits, as well as some large operating companies.",
      "Many types of banks and other financial services businesses don't need to file, according to FinCEN. Some other types of businesses, such as many sole proprietorships, are also exempt, it noted. (A list and Q&A on exemptions can be seen here.)",
      "What may happen next in the CTA case?",

    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",

      "The lawyers wrote that the neuropsychologist concluded that cognitive impairments, including impaired memory, diminished attention, processing speed slowness, and ease of confusion means Jeffries would not be capable of assisting his attorneys.",
      "In a joint letter to the judge, defense lawyers and prosecutors suggested that experts who have evaluated Jeffries testify at a two-day competency hearing in June so that a ruling on competency can follow. A spokesperson for prosecutors said Tuesday that the office would have no further comment.",
      "Jeffries arrest came after a 2023 lawsuit filed by an actor that alleged the former CEO ran a sex trafficking operation that targeted aspiring male models. In the current case, prosecutors say Jeffries, his romantic partner and a third man lured men into drug-fueled sex parties in the Hamptons, on Long Island, by dangling the promise of modeling for the retailer's ads.",
      "Jeffries left Abercrombie in 2014 after more than two decades leading the clothing retailer once famous for its preppy, all-American aesthetic and marketing with shirtless male models.",
      "In an indictment unveiled in October, prosecutors alleged that 15 accusers were induced by \"force, fraud and coercion\" to engage in sex parties from 2008 to 2015 in New York City and the Hamptons, the wealthy summertime resort on Long Island where Jeffries has a home, as well as at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.",
      "Prosecutors say the men were sometimes directed to wear costumes, use sex toys and endure painful erection-inducing penile injections.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 09:37:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",

      "Carter completed submarine training and served in the Navy for seven years before moving home to Georgia to run the family peanut farm. He and Rosalynn raised four children while his career focus shifted from farming to politics.",
      "After eight years in state offices, Carter, a Democrat, was elected governor of Georgia in 1970. It was clear he was a new kind of Southern leader, one who emphasized racial equality and traditional values, at a time when the nation was in need of stability.",
      "In 1976 \u2014 America's bicentennial year \u2014 he defeated President Gerald Ford to become the 39th president of the United States. The Carters conveyed that they were of the people when they marched in the open air on the inaugural parade route.",
      "\"His greatest asset as a candidate was his outsider status,\" Brinkley said. \"And his greatest failing as a president was the fact that he remained an outsider, when you must be an insider in Washington if you're going to be an effective president.\"",
      "He struggled to cultivate relationships in Washington and feuded openly with Democratic leaders in Congress. As oil prices and inflation soared, his popularity sank.",
      "But there were accomplishments along the way. Carter created the departments of Energy and Education. He established formal diplomatic ties with China and returned control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians.",
      "Perhaps his greatest achievement was a historic peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, known as the Camp David Accords.",
      "\"Let history record that deep and ancient antagonism can be settled without bloodshed and without a staggering waste of precious lives,\" Carter said at the signing of the peace treaty on March 26, 1979.",
      "On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. A U.S. military attempt to free them ended in disaster, with eight American servicemen killed in a crash. The crisis dominated Carter's reelection campaign, while the economy continued to struggle and inflation topped 18%.",
      "In the final days of his administration, the president and his team negotiated freedom for the hostages. They were released on Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day.",
      "In the years after leaving the White House, the Carters established The Carter Center in Atlanta, with a mission to work toward advancing peace and global health.",
      "\"We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes \u2014 and we must,\" he said in 2002 as he formally accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his decades of humanitarian work.",
      "He and Rosalynn built houses with Habitat for Humanity, dedicating their efforts to the group for more than 30 years, and he penned more than 20 books.",
      "He sparked controversy with his 2006 book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\" in which he characterized Israel's treatment of Palestinians as oppression. He later issued an open apology to the Jewish community, saying that suggestions for improvement should not stigmatize Israel.",
      "In 2007, Carter spoke at the funeral of his former political rival turned close friend and confidante, former President Ford.",
      "\"One of my proudest moments was at the commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, when two noted historians both declared that the Ford-Carter friendship was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history,\" Carter said.",
      "Carter announced in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with cancer, a form of melanoma that had spread to his liver and his brain. Though he curtailed his activities with The Carter Center, he continued to fundraise for the organization, and also continued teaching Sunday school classes in Plains, a tradition he started in his teens.",
      "Carter was treated with a new immunotherapy drug and made a remarkable recovery, sharing the news six months later that an MRI showed no signs of cancer.",
      "In May 2019, he suffered another health setback, falling and breaking his hip. He went home from the hospital to recover and was soon back to teaching his Sunday school class. Carter suffered two more falls in October 2019 and was hospitalized for a fractured pelvis. A month later, he was admitted to a hospital in Atlanta for a surgical procedure to relieve pressure on his brain.",
      "The Carter Center said in May 2023 that Rosalynn had been diagnosed with dementia; she continued to live at home with her husband until her death that November.",
      "They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",
      "During his many years after the White House, Carter planted seeds of peace, and sometimes seeds of controversy. But as one of the most active former presidents in history, many believe he defined the role for those who would follow.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 16:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After a single term in office, Jimmy Carter's decades of humanitarian work may be his most enduring legacy.",
    "story": [
      "Elected in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia, ran as a Washington outsider and rose to the White House with a strong sense of morality, an engineer's mind and a progressive, moderate approach to governing.",
      "Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100, after going into hospice care\u00a0in February 2023 at his home in Plains, Georgia, served only a single term in office but devoted the decades that followed to bettering the lives of countless people across the U.S. and around the world.",
      "He faced massive crises during his presidency \u2014 sky-high oil prices, double-digit interest rates and inflation, and the Iran hostage crisis \u2014 and his failure to effectively address them resulted in his failure to win reelection in 1980. He also had some major accomplishments, including the negotiation of a peace deal between Egypt and Israel.",
      "But it is his widely lauded post-presidency, characterized by tireless peace and humanitarian efforts, that is likely to be his most enduring legacy.",
      "After leaving office in 1981, Carter became an important diplomatic figure, securing the release of political prisoners in Nicaragua in 1986 and of American Aijalon Gomes from North Korea in 2010. He served as a negotiator with North Korea during the Clinton administration, and even offered his services to then-President Trump in talks with North Korea.",
      "Along with his wife, Rosalynn Carter \u2014 who died at age 96 on Nov. 19, 2023 \u2014   he founded the Carter Center in 1982, a nonprofit human rights organization that took on as its broad mission the alleviation of human suffering. Through the work of the Carter Center, he devoted himself to preventing and resolving global conflicts, promoting freedom and democracy, and improving the health of millions of people around the world.",
      "Among other initiatives, the Carter Center oversaw efforts to conduct free and fair elections in dozens of countries in the developing world, and helped lead global efforts to eliminate Guinea worm disease, which spread through unfiltered drinking water and once sickened millions across Africa.",
      "Carter was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in advancing democracy and human rights through the Carter Center.",
      "\"We have transformed the lives of, I would say, millions of people, primarily in the poorest and most destitute and forgotten communities in the world,\" he told CBS News' Rita Braver in a 2006 interview.",
      "The Carters also worked for decades with Habitat for Humanity to build homes for those in need. Carter first became involved in 1984 and remained active building homes with the organization for decades. The day after he fell in his Plains, Georgia, home in October 2019, leaving him with a black eye and stitches at the age of 95, Carter still traveled to Tennessee to volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.",
      "He and Rosalynn sponsored the Carter Work Project at Habitat for Humanity for over 30 years. According to the organization, the Carters have worked \"alongside 104,000 volunteers in 14 countries to build, renovate and repair 4,390 homes.\"",
      "A devout Christian, the former president also made an impact in his local community as a teacher. He taught Sunday School at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains until nearly the end of his life. He also taught at Emory University in Atlanta for nearly 40 years.",
      "Carter acknowledged that his post-presidential activities had earned him higher regard than he'd experienced in office.",
      "\"Certainly my reputation has been better in the post-presidential years than maybe in the White House,\" he said in that 2006 interview. \"But I think that when people look at back on what we did in the White House, I think there's a lot there of justifiable pride.\"",
      "Throughout his post-presidency, he was never afraid to speak out when troubled by policies of those who succeeded him in the White House. He was an early and vocal critic of the war in Iraq begun under President George W. Bush, and he opposed the Obama administration's use of drone strikes to target suspected terrorists.",
      "He criticized Trump for \"exacerbating\" racial tensions and being \"careless with the truth,\" telling CBS News' John Dickerson in 2018, \"I think I went through my campaign and my presidency without ever lying to the people or making a deliberately false statement, and I think that would be a very worthwhile thing to reinsert into politics these days.\" He added that he wished Trump well \"and I pray for him.\"",
      "Carter joined fellow past presidents in condemning the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and he marked the date one year later by writing: \"I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally \u2014 the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power \u2014 has become dangerously fragile at home. \u2026 For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct.\"",
      "Carter wrote 33 books, including memoirs about his life and career, as well as books on other topics like faith and aging.",
      "He and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years, and were known for their devotion to one another. They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "I'm Major Garrett, in for Margaret Brennan.",
      "As we close out 2024, we, of course, want to look ahead to the economy, health care, immigration, so much more, as Washington ushers in a new Congress and, importantly, a new administration.",
      "We begin with a Face the Nation tradition, our year-end correspondents roundtable.",
      "Joining us, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns, and senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.",
      "It is great to have you all with us.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, I want to start with you.",
      "The new Congress will be sworn in this week. What position does Mike Johnson, the current speaker of the House, find himself in seeking reelection to that position?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It's a tenuous position. It has the prospect and promise of having high drama Friday, when they begin the new Congress January 3 by choosing the new speaker.",
      "One of the most underappreciated and underreported issues of the 2024 election was this incredibly narrow margin Republicans preserved in the U.S. House, even more narrow than the one that gridlocked them over the past two years.",
      "And, of course, the first order of business is choosing a speaker. Republicans have just one or two votes to spare on anything. That has the possibility of paralyzing things. And we saw two years ago the speaker vote was like a \u2013 it's like Gilligan's Island. It was supposed to be a three- hour vote and ended up being a multi-arc drama with many divergent characters, not including Thurston Howell.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: But here's the thing. It's just the top layer of this very treacherous cake for them is picking a speaker, because, what does this next speaker have to concede to win that post?",
      "We saw over the last two years the prior speaker had to concede positions on the pivotal Rules Committee to some contrarian voices in the Rules Committees, where bills went to die, instead of to get set up for a vote. And that's why so many Democratic votes were needed for so many pivotal things, because the Rules Committee was jammed up by contrarians.",
      "That could happen again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa, I want to turn to you, because, if he were so inclined, president-elect Trump could clarify his preference here. And that would send an important signal to those Republicans in the House majority to be still on the fence about this, yet he remains conspicuously silent.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: That decision is reflective of the dynamic right now down at Mar-a-Lago, the president's retreat in Florida.",
      "There is high drama, as Scott reports, on Capitol Hill. But, in Trump's inner circle, it's almost like the low-key second season of a TV show. That's how it's been described to me by allies of president-elect Trump. He's being guided by Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff.",
      "And she's created, I'm told, this atmosphere of calm when it comes to some of the nominees, the process, laying out the agenda for next year, top of the agenda, tax cuts, trying to expand those Trump tax cuts from 2017, of course, mass deportations also part of Trump's plan, a border bill as well.",
      "And you do have controversial nominees in Kash Patel for the FBI, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, among others. But, at its core, you have a president-elect who's now comfortable with power, comfortable with the people around him.",
      "This is so different, Major, than what we saw in 2016, when we were covering that transition period. It had this theatrical element, Trump welcoming people to Bedminster for these showy appearances and interviews.",
      "Now we rarely see the president-elect. He's firing off missives at times on TRUTH Social, his platform, but he's often behind the scenes getting ready for 2025, because he's been here before. He knows what he wants to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe, President Biden remains president of the United States, though some Americans might have to be reminded of that fact.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What is ahead for the president in the waning days of his presidency in terms of travel and possible pardons?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, he is taking one final foreign trip, and it was one that we \u2013 those of us who followed him a long time anticipated might happen. And that is a trip to the Vatican to see the pope and then to see the Italian leadership as well.",
      "They have been in far closer contact than I think many people appreciate, because the pope, like the president, shares a lot of the concerns about the state of the world, about what's going on in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Conflict, climate change.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely, yes, and state of democracy and just general concern for social justice, which is\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Refugee flows, exactly.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, exactly.",
      "And so that will be a critical political meeting, but also a real personal capstone for the second Catholic president.",
      "And it speaks as well to one of the things he's been focused on over the last several weeks and will continue to be. We're still waiting to hear more about, for example, pardons and clemency. Will there be more of those? And will they be for the everyman? Or will they be for notable political figures like, for example, Jesse Jackson Jr., the former congressman from Illinois, or others who've ended up in the legal system and maybe are well- known and are now appealing for some kind of leniency or forgiveness?",
      "And so those 37 death row clemencies that we saw before Christmas, a good example of what's to come and what he's eager to do, and also a good example of what little he can do, because, of course, Congress has no interest in working with him. They can't even really sort out what to do with themselves, but \u2013 so he's using the executive privileges that he has in these waning weeks.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, as you know better than anyone at this table, this last year was a clash of law and politics, unlike anything we have seen in our modern American history.",
      "The judicial system in our country, according to Gallup, 35 percent confidence, 20 percent below our peer countries, other free market democracies. How much of that is a reflection of this clash, the Supreme Court, or just a sense that our judicial system has become, in the words of someone we have all come to know, two-tiered?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, that's a hard question to answer, because I think you have got a\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We always give you the easiest ones, Jan.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: But I'm going to try, Major, because I think it goes \u2013 you have got to look past just this past year and go further back.",
      "I think it really started and took off in the wake of the Dobbs decision, the court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The outrage over that decision was so extreme that you saw, I think, a quite calculated effort to undermine legitimacy of the Supreme Court by Democrats, Senate Democrats, for example, hearings, stories about scandals, some of which were pretty overblown, to say the least.",
      "So, that has an impact on public opinion. The public starts to believe that this court is corrupt, that this is \u2013 it's on the take, none of which is true. I mean, this is still a court. You may disagree with their decisions. It's a very conservative court. It is not a corrupt court.",
      "These are nine justices who have very different views on how to interpret the Constitution who are kind of in this Titanic struggle over law, not politics.",
      "Even the immunity decision, I mean, that decision was so misreported to say that the court was going to save Trump from a criminal trial. No, it wasn't. That was never the decision. In fact, that decision is going to help protect Joe Biden from any future prosecution by Donald Trump if he wanted to do that.",
      "So, when we look at public opinion polls, sure, the court's taken a hit, but that's true over the years. The court often takes a hit. So do other institutions. And the court's opinion \u2013 court's public opinion remains much higher than our other institutions, including the White House, Congress, and by far the news media.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Congress at 17 percent, according to Gallup.",
      "Caitlin, Jan mentioned the Dobbs decision. One of the things that roiled through the political calendar year of 2024 was how important, how impactful would that decision be on turnout and the ultimate outcome of the election?",
      "But, as you traveled the country, you kept telling us, yes, it's an important issue, but there are other things on the minds of women voters in this country.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, we always say that voters have the capacity to think about a lot of different things at once.",
      "And we saw, in the wake of that decision in the midterms, that was top of mind for people. It was the first way to kind of exercise their views across the country on this issue. But, this time around, voters had different ways to express their feelings about the Dobbs decision.",
      "Many of them had ballot measures in their states, a couple of those states being battleground states, that they could vote for codifying abortion rights into their state law and also vote for Donald Trump, because they believed in his views on the economy, on immigration, or at least that he could solve some of their concerns about them.",
      "And as I spoke to women across the country, as we all spent the whole year talking to voters and really listening to voters, a lot of women talked to me about how concerned they were about safety, about the economy, a lot of them responsible for their family's budgets, paying the bills, going to the grocery store, these kinds of fundamental things.",
      "And, also, it was kind of a reminder that we have been treating women as kind of a monolithic group in the wake of Dobbs. And this election showed that it's not as such, that they do care a lot about safety, the economy. Those were overarching issues, but they also do care about women's rights, abortion rights, but they just had other avenues to express that.",
      "And that's really what helped. And Donald Trump also modified his positions, at least to satisfy some of those voters, at least that I spoke to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert, Caitlin brought up women's concerns about security. That flows through immigration.",
      "I wonder what your perspective is on this online feud that's gone on, on for the last three or four days between parts of the MAGA universe over H- 1B visas, which are essentially visas set aside for high-skilled laborers, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and nominally president-elect Trump on the side of that, hard right nativist parts of the MAGA movement using expletives on social media typically reserved for their political foes, not for those in the MAGA tent, assailing one another.",
      "What do you make of all of that?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The coalition that lifted Donald Trump back to power included Silicon Valley executives. Elon Musk, Trump inner circle members say, deserves a lot of credit for pouring a lot of money in the final months into the campaign.",
      "But at the end of the day, this was a campaign where so many voters at rally after rally we covered were holding up signs that said \"Mass Deportations Now.\" The message was obvious, it was in your face.",
      "And for \u2013 the idea that president-elect Trump is going to back away from his immigration position because of some whisper in his ear from a Silicon Valley billionaire, it's just not happening, based on my reporting.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Scott, very quickly, do you think that \u2013 we have got about 30 seconds before we need to go to break. How much do you think that will be a part of the early congressional conversation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think this battle over the debt limit which Elon Musk weighed in on is going to be the first throw-down of 2025 and impact the first year of Trump's term, because they're going to need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling.",
      "That won't satisfy the Elon Musks of the world. I'm not sure how Trump circumvents Democratic concessions for the debt ceiling.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When we come back, you know it, you love it, predictions, biggest story, things that were undercovered with our outstanding correspondents panel.",
      "We will be back in just one moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation and our correspondents roundtable.",
      "Predictions.",
      "Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I think the biggest story to watch this coming year is how the president-elect when he becomes president handles immigration.",
      "We talked a lot about how the economy was the overarching theme of this election. Immigration is what Trump made his not only closing \u2013 closing argument on, but his entire campaign was really rooted in immigration.",
      "So what this looks like, we saw in our polling majority support for mass deportations. What does that actually look like? And how do they handle that once we see what that looks like on television, how they have people explaining their policy, and what those stories look like because of that, and whether the base is satisfied and whether the general public gets what they voted for on that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, 2025 prediction.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I will go back to the court.",
      "I think that Donald Trump will probably get his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court either this year or maybe next year, when\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Because someone retires.",
      "Who?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: He was nominated, took the bench in 2006, after nearly two decades on the court.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Most importantly, Marcus Freeman and the Fighting Irish will win the Sugar Bowl on January 1.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Now, this is normally my prediction with Alabama.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I'm stepping into your territory. But\u2026",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm happy to give it to you.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Governing by crisis in 2025.",
      "Ed, when we first met over a decade ago, we were covering crisis on Capitol Hill. Crisis persists. Such a handful \u2013 and Caitlin Huey-Burns as well. And Scott was there as well.",
      "Look, they only have a handful of seats in the House for the Republican majority. They can only do so much, as Scott said, debt limit battle on the horizon, spending fights. Deja vu. That culture of crisis, governing to the brink of discussions is here again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will make the firmer prediction that, based on all that chaos, Speaker Johnson won't be speaker by the end of 2025.",
      "Did that a few years ago on Paul Ryan, and it worked. So, watch out, Speaker Johnson. Nothing personal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be careful, Speaker Johnson. Be advised.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But just look at \u2013 look at what faces him.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ROBERT COSTA: \u2026 real soon.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The other one real quick, Washington Commanders will get a stadium here in the District of Columbia, because that congressional vote that authorized land\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Happened right before Congress adjourned.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: It sure did. And it was a great surprise at D.C. It'll happen this year.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott MacFarlane.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Long before the next election, there will be some people departing Washington voluntarily. This is a challenging environment to be an elected official.",
      "They're getting thousands of threats a year on their lives, on their families. The travel is exhausting. And we're coming into a relatively polarizing moment with Trump coming back into office. You're going to see a lot of retirements in odd-numbered years, including 2025.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think that's one reason why you're going to see Justice Alito step down.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things we also do in the year-end correspondents roundtable is dig into what was undercovered or underreported.",
      "Jan?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Undercovered and underreported, that would be, to me, Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline that became undeniable in the televised debate.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: At the presidential debate with Donald Trump.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Unquestioned.",
      "And it's starting to emerge now that his advisers kind of managed his limitations, which has been reported in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" for four years. And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats.",
      "It could have changed the scope of the entire election. Yet still, incredibly, we read in \"The Washington Post\" that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump. And I think that is either delusional or they're gaslighting the American people.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: President Biden has said repeatedly he was sick during the debate June 27 in Atlanta and he's always been fine and he leaves fine.",
      "That is his position, the position of many of his top aides as well, even though there is that reporting.",

Are the \u2013 the industrial worker in this country. Is it going to be the Democratic Party or the Republican Party? It remains a key story, deserves more attention.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I mentioned how we covered women voters, but also I think there is an aspect to which we underestimated or perhaps the public underestimated how Trump's personality wasn't as much of a burden to him.",
      "And, in some ways, it turned out to be a benefit with low-propensity voters. And talking to the Trump campaign throughout the cycle and reporting on it, they were making this bet that, if he leaned into his personality and made no qualms about it, made no apologies about it, that would kind of speak to this authenticity factor, this premium that low- propensity voters, those not inclined to participate in elections, might be inclined towards.",
      "It was a big bet. It paid off. And it will remain \u2013 the biggest question I have is whether Republicans can replicate any of that, because so much of their political wins this year are unique to Donald Trump himself.",

      "Trump has never specified if it's everybody or just some people. Will it include people who gassed and beat police officers with baseball bats, or will it just be those who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors? He's never been pressed to specify if it's all or some. And what's the political impact?",
      "Did his voters really want that? Does he gain political capital or lose it if he pardons everyone?",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the U.S. reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana.",
      "For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner.",
      "Dr. Leana Wen, it's great to have you with us.",
      "So, bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And, if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): Well, it's one more sign that the drumbeat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat.",
      "So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. Sixteen states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive.",
      "And now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans.",
      "But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill, but not only that. Researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.",
      "Bird flu has been around for a long time, but it hasn't\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: About 30 years.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, exactly.",
      "But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation. And there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment\u2026",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. That's right.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right.",
      "And so the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus. And if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.",
      "The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that, just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farmworkers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.",
      "And the second very important thing is, this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost five million doses of the vaccine.",
      "However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so \u2013 and to farmworkers and to vulnerable people.",
      "I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?",
      "I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available, so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that, in prior outbreaks of the bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52 percent, 52 percent.",
      "However, in the \u2013 in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild, and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals.",
      "People infected so far in the U.S. have been mainly farmworkers, who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses.",
      "We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And, again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Thirty seconds.",
      "Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose.",
      "Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the U.S. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And, also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it.",
      "We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but, first, we're going to take a quick break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Dr. Leana Wen and a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen.",
      "Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing in the context of bird flu and preparations therefore. Vaccines and testings were part of the Covid conversation and the Trump administration, when it was in charge.",
      "What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine, testing, public health, efficacy?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN, (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Markary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, we have worked together for the last ten-plus years on issues like hospital medical error (ph). He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.",
      "But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti- vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti-vaxing advocates in the country, if not in the world over the last couple of decades.",
      "He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that, if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind if there are new facts that are presented.",
      "It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are lifesaving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccination have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet (ph) study, childhood vaccines saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean these are facts. And it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the - in how science works and basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it, I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe as we could be having for bird flu the way that we had for Covid.",
      "There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed. Other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well.",
      "And I think it's a major problem that in the U.S. we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. Thanking you twice. And a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you. To you, too, Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave.",
      "Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you.",
      "I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE (Senior U.S. Economist, Bank of America): Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "So, we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well.",
      "You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022. That was a year in which GDP grew by only 1 percent. CPI inflation peaked at 9 percent. And all of the talk back then was stagflation, when, not if, is a recession going to arrive. Why are workers quiet quitting. And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected and in a very pleasant way. Three percent GDP growth. Inflation coming down. Labor productivity moving up. So, all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2 percent, albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger x factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy. And there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So, with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right, the majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So, if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with.",
      "And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right, so how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market and our country, that is to say put upward pressure on prices because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, I think it's - our base (ph) case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations.",
      "From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some down risks to economic activity if there's a large change in the population, right? That's just math.",
      "In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the U.S. economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So, we think that we can continue to grow at around 2 to 2.5 percent this - the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, in reading year-end summaries, \"The Economist,\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post,\" all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be to exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to day, to give a specific number. Our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 6,600, 6,700 by the end of the year.",
      "What you can say is that, obviously, there's been a pretty aggressive run- up in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late '90s if we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy in 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, when it comes to A.I., I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of A.I. adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So, I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026. It might be a story for a few years down the line.",
      "But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for A.I., right? So, if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes. We need to -",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires materials. It requires energy supply.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Aditya, we need to go. Pardon - pardon me.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires labor, you - you put - sure. Sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to.",
      "Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year and thank you so much for being with us.",
      "We'll be right back in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In 22 days Donald Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 47th president, only the second to serve two nonconsecutive terms.",
      "For more perspective on the most powerful position in the world, we spoke with David Rubenstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group. His new book, \"The Highest Calling,\" studies the highs and lows of some of this country's most consequential presidents.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How would you compare, based on your study of the presidency, our unsettled times now to unsettled times past?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN (Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, The Carlyle Group): Well, nothing is as bad as the Civil War, when we had 3 percent of our population killed and the fighting in Washington was so bad that about 60 different times members of Congress hit other members of Congress on the floor of the Congress. So, we're not quite there yet.",
      "Clearly, though, we're going into some uncharted waters because we have a president coming back who had been president before. That hadn't happened since Grover Cleveland was re-elected in 1892. And Trump has got more power than I think many people would have thought by the virtue of his victory size. And I do think he's going to act like he's got a mandate and Washington is bracing for what's going to happen.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Related to that, before the election results were known, polls indicated pretty consistently that Trump supporters were afraid if Harris would win, Harris supporters were afraid if Trump would win.",
      "Based on your study of this institution, the presidency, can you recall a time where that fear of an outcome was as prevalent as it was leading into this election?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, there have been a couple times when people really were afraid that the next person coming in that was the opposite party would really hurt the country in many ways. Clearly, my former boss, Jimmy Carter, really feared Ronald Reagan. He thought that Ronald Reagan was going to do - undo many of the things that Carter had done. Obviously, Reagan won by a landslide.",
      "And you've seen other times when this has happened as well. So, for example, when FDR won the first time, Herbert Hoover could not believe that this man, Herbert Hoover, had been such a distinguished American before he was president, and while he was president he had problems, but he was a very distinguished person. He never took FDR seriously. And FDR didn't really take Hoover that seriously. He refused to really meet with him, essentially, or met with him briefly and they just didn't want anything to do with him - each other.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Grover Cleveland. There's not a chapter in the book about Grover Cleveland. Is there anything that retroactively fascinates you about the Cleveland presidency now that Trump has returned to office, or are you similarly fascinated by the time in which he was president, the Gilded Age?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Grover Cleveland was a Democrat, a former governor of New York, very well respected, but he lost the election in 1888, and he came back in 1892. Now, one of the things we don't really know is whether a president, when he has a second term after he's been out of office, whether he'll be fresher, whether he'll bring better people in, whether he'll be more experienced.",
      "For example, Grover Cleveland's second term was reasonably successful. And, you know, maybe Trump's will be as well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things the nation struggled with this last 18 months or so was the collision of politics and the law. Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from this clash and the politics that came from the clash of trying to indict and try someone who had been president of the United States and was aspiring to that office again?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think there is a feeling among many people that it wasn't a good idea to indict the president of the United States. I think the trial in New York, where Trump was convicted, I think really helped him in his election effort. And I think there are many people who are - who are Trump supporters who believe that the indictments that came out of the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, were really political as well.",
      "And so I think there's - both sides feel that the other side is really talking past each other. The people who are in the Justice Department now feel that these indictments were fair and correct and had a special prosecutor and so forth. The Trump people believe they were completely political. I hope going forward that the Justice Department is not seen as political because one of the strengths of this country has been the rule of law, and I hope that the Justice Department that's coming in now will continue that tradition.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have a president in mind who, based on your study, grew in your regard and a president in your mind who, based on your study, got more diminished?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Harry Truman left office extremely unpopular, very unpopular, and he was thought to be an inappropriate (ph) successor to the great FDR. Now, because of books by David McCollough and other people who have written great books about Truman, people see him as one of our great presidents because post-World War II he helped end the war because he dropped the atomic bomb, which many people say was a mistake, but ki would say many historians think it was necessary to avoid -",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And he never doubted?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He never doubted. He never had self-doubt. Self-doubt was one of - was not one of his thing. He always believed it was the right decision. But he also was responsible for NATO, the U.N., the World Bank, the IMF, and the CIA, which he created as well. All these things he created",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And the recognition of Israel.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes, he recognized Israel, even though his secretary of state threatened to resign over it. So, he was a person who has really risen up.",
      "A person who's gone down, I would say, or two that have gone down a lot. One is Andrew Jackson. Remember, Democrats used to say, we're going to have a Jefferson-Jackson day dinner. You don't have that anymore because Jackson is now widely seen as being racist and very anti-Native American, and he really did many things that I think killed a lot of people, particularly in the Native American community. So, he's not really well respected today by scholars.",
      "Another person I would say is - is that - whose reputation has gone down is Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the great reformer after being president at Princeton, two years later he's - he's governor of New Jersey, then president of the United States.",
      "However, he now is widely seen as having done two things that were really big mistakes. One, he resegregated the federal workforce and had been integrated. Two, and this is very damaging I think as well, he - he had a stroke and with about 18 months to go, he couldn't really do what he had done before. He hid that from the public, and his wife essentially became a shadow president. She was really making decisions and deciding things that maybe he should have decided, and the public didn't know this. And that was a big problem.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You often ask biographers what question they would most want to pose to the subject of their presidential biography. Let me expand on that. If you could go to dinner with any president, who would it be, and what question would you want to make sure you got answered?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Without doubt, the greatest president and the greatest American ever is Abraham Lincoln. He was a person who - was not an abolitionist but ultimately came to free the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. And he also won the Civil War despite the fact that many people in the north didn't really want to fight the Civil War. They'd say, let the south go, we'll have our own country. Lincoln said, no, we're going to hold the union together. And he did that. We lost 3 percent of our population in the war, but he kept the union together and I think made the United States a stronger country as a result.",
      "We ended slavery eventually because of the 13th amendment. But, most importantly, he did it with humility. He didn't run around saying, look, I just won the Civil War. I just did the Gettysburg Address. Isn't that a great speech? He didn't do that. He didn't brag about it. He was very humble. And I think he had a sense of humor and a sense of perspective that is a really good thing for presidents.",
      "And I would like to ask him, do you have any regrets about not having freed the slaves earlier? Do you have any regrets about not getting rid of some of your generals earlier who were not very good? And he waited a couple years before he got Ulysses S. Grant in.",
      "Grant is also a person I should mention. He had the most amazing meteoric rise of almost anybody who's become president. He was selling firewood on the streets of St. Louis in 1860. The war breaks out in 1861, more or less, and eight years later he's president of the United States. I mean it's just amazing.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned humility. George W. Bush told you in your interview with him that that was the most important characteristic a president can possession. I've read other words that are important for presidents - courage, compassion, curiosity, decisiveness. Based on your study, what would you say is the most important?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the most important thing is having a perspective that you really want to do what's right for the American people. You're not trying to make money. You're not trying to feather your own nest. You're not trying to worry about history. You're just trying to do what's best for the American people.",
      "The qualities that I admire in leaders are people who are reasonably intelligent but not geniuses. You don't have to be a genius to be a great president. People who are willing to listen to other people. People that have some humility. People that are highly ethical. Those are the qualities that I think great leaders have in any area.",
      "Overall, we've gotten some pretty talented people who have served as president of the United States. And we've been fortunate. Lincoln, Washington, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Jefferson, and modern day presidents, Eisenhower, among others, have had some really great attributes and the country is good and I think better off for having had good people serve.",
      "One of my concerns in the future is that because it's become so political in Washington sometimes and the fight - infighting has been so intense that I'm not sure that - as many good people want to rise up and run for president in the future as we've seen in the past.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned in your very first answer the Civil War, the greatest time of testing in our country's history. You don't have to be very aggressive online to find casual talk among Americans about another civil war. They banty it about with some frequency.",
      "How worried are you about that, and do you think the mere discussion of it creates the potential of an inevitability?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think there has been discussions. Some people say the red states and the blue states should separate, but I don't think that's realistic or really going to happen. I think the country realizes that we are the strongest power in the world economically, militarily, politically, culturally and, in part, because the country's got a big enough population, and in part because we have a lot of attributes in red and blue states. I don't think it's realistic. People talk about that, but I don't think that's going to happen. The country is not going to be split up the way it was in the Civil War. I just don't see that as being realistic or desirable.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any doubt in your mind that presidents, all presidents, must guard against bitterness, anger, resentment, some of the things that fueled their pursuit of the office in the first place? Meaning, once they got there they need to set those things aside, even though they were part of the engine?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Everybody goes through life and has ups and downs. And you get a lot of bitterness and you get resentment of people. People that are good presidents ultimately rise up above that. A lot of people criticized Abraham Lincoln for many, many things. They called him all kinds of terrible names and they did say he was barely human.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: They called him a gorilla.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes. And he rose above that. And I think you have to rise above it. And, hopefully, when you don't have to worry about politics anymore in a second term, for example, you can rise above all the concerns you've had. When you're president of the United States, if you carry your resentments too long, it can affect others people adversely. So, I think in the case of President Trump, for example, clearly he has some resentments, but I think overall I believe he's going to rise above that in his second term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is Richard Nixon, which you, in your book, describe as a tragic figure, almost a Shakespearean-like tragic figure, the most available cautionary tale about resentments in the presidency?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: If only Shakespeare had been alive to write about Richard Nixon, it would have been a wonderful tragedy. He's a man who's really talented, very smart. He stumbles from running for president in 1960, barely loses. Loses for 1962 in the governorship of California and comes back and is elected in 1968 against all the odds.",
      "But he resented the people that looked down on him. He resented the liberals. He resented the ivy leaguers, as he would call them. And he really, I think, took those resentments and he perpetuated them through his chief of staff, Rob Haldeman and other people. And the result was a terrible thing called Watergate.",
      "I think Richard Nixon, had he not had Watergate, I think he would have gone down as a really impressive president because they opened to China, things he did on the environment. But Watergate will be what he's remembered for.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Was he the least ethical president in our history?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think there's - that's easy to say because some presidents had issues that we don't know about as much. Richard Nixon wasn't a person who was trying to make money for himself necessarily. He wasn't grafting himself into - into business deals and so forth. But I think he had some ethical failings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The book is called \"The Highest Calling.\" Is the presidency the highest calling? Some might argue that an age defining innovation is a higher calling or being a captain of industry is a higher calling, or just being a simple CEO employing tens of thousands of people is a higher calling. Why is it the highest calling?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The reason I called it \"The Highest Calling,\" and I had historically said that private equity, my profession, was the highest calling, but that was more tongue-in-cheek, is this. When Woodrow Wilson went to Paris to help end World War I, he was cheered by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Parisians. And people, for the first time, realized the most important person in the United States, in the world, really, is the president of the United States. And that's been true almost since Wilson came back from Paris.",
      "When FDR was running, the world really effectively, because he was president of the United States during World War II, he was the most important person in the world for sure. And I think ever since then, because of the economic, military, political power of the United States, whoever is the leader of the United States is almost certainly the most powerful person in the world, and pursuing what I would call the highest calling because you can affect the lives of people so much more significantly as president of the United States than any other job in the world.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave. Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you. I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration is inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE, BANK OF AMERICA SENIOR ECONOMIST: Good morning. Thank you for having me so we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA data on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well. You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022, that was a year in which GDP grew by only 1%, CPI inflation peaked at 9% and all of the talk back then was stagflation. When, not if, is a recession going to arrive, why are workers quiet quitting? And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected, and in a very pleasant way. 3% GDP growth, inflation coming down, labor productivity moving up. So all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2% albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger X factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy, and there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right? The majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with. And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right. So how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market in our country? That is to say, put upward pressure on prices, because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So I think it's our best case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations. From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some downside risks to economic activity. If there's a large change in the population right, that's just math. In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning, essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the US economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So we think that we can continue to grow at around two to two and a half percent this the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So in reading year end summaries, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be too exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to say, to give a specific number, our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 66-6700 by the end of this year. What you can say is that obviously there's been a pretty aggressive run up in- in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late 90s. If we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So when it comes to AI, I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of AI adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026, it might be a story for a few years down the line. But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for AI, right? So if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right? It requires materials. It requires energy supply\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Right we need to, pardon me\u2013",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: \u2013it requires labor, sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to. Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year, and thank you so much for being with us. We'll be right back in just a moment."

    "story": [
      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Leana Wen on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 29, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the US reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana. For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner. Dr Leana Wynn, it's great to have you with us. So bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, it's one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat. So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans. But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors. Bird flu has been around for a long time--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: -- About 30 years--",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, exactly. But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation, and there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment, that's right, where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. And so, the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus, and if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left. The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not. And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine. However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so- and to farm workers and to vulnerable people. I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that in prior outbreaks of the bird flu that the mortality rate is 52%. 52%. However, in the- in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals. People infected so far in the US have been mainly farm workers who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses. We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: 30 seconds. Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose. Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the US. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it. We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but first we're going to take a quick break.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen. Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing and the context of bird flu and preparations, therefore, vaccines and testing were part of the COVID conversation. And the Trump administration when it was in charge. What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine testing, public health efficacy.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon. We have worked together for the last 10 plus years on issues like hospital- medical ERM.\u00a0 He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges. But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades. He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind. If there are new facts that are presented. It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are life saving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccinations have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet study, childhood vaccines have saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean, these are facts, and it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the- in how science works, in basic scientific principles, to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier, for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it. I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID. There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well. And I think it's a major problem that in the US, we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise, thanking you twice and a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you to you too, Major."

      "MAJOR GARRETT: David, it's great to see you. Thanks for joining us.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You don't know this, but I have waged a kind of unsuccessful journalistic battle against the word unprecedented. My sense is, as disruptive as our current times have been, we've had jarring and disruptive times before in American history. How would you compare, based on your study of the presidency, our unsettled times now to unsettled times past?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, nothing is as bad as the Civil War when we had 3% of our population killed and the fighting in Washington was so bad that about 60 different times members of Congress hit other members of Congress on the floor of the Congress. So we're not quite there yet. Clearly, though, we're going into some uncharted waters because we have a president coming back who had been president before. That hadn't happened since Grover Cleveland was reelected in 1892 and Trump is- got more power than I think many people would have thought by the virtue of his victory size. In other words, he didn't win the way that, let's say, Richard Nixon did in his second term or Ronald Reagan in his second term, but he's won by enough so that people feel he's got a mandate and certainly he feels he's got a mandate. And I do think he's going to act like he's got a mandate. And Washington is bracing for what's going to happen",
      "MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 Related to that, before the election results were known, polls indicated pretty consistently that Trump supporters were afraid if Harris would win, Harris supporters were afraid if Trump would win. Based on your study of this institution, the presidency, can you recall a time where that fear of an outcome was as prevalent as it was leading into this election?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, there've been a couple of times when people really were afraid that the next person coming in that was the opposite party would really hurt the country in many ways. Clearly, my former boss, Jimmy Carter, really feared Ronald Reagan. He thought that Ronald Reagan was going to do- undo many of the things that Carter had done. Obviously, Reagan won by a landslide and you've seen other times when this just happened as well. So, for example, when FDR won the first time, Herbert Hoover could not believe that this man, Herbert Hoover, had been such a distinguished American before he was president. And while he was president, he had problems. But he was a very distinguished person. He never took FDR seriously, and FDR didn't really take Hoover that seriously. In fact, he refused during the long period of the- of the- of the period between the election and the inauguration. He refused to really meet with him, essentially, or met with him briefly. And they just didn't want anything to do with each other.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Interestingly, in those days, the inauguration occurred about six months after the election. The election was in November and the inauguration was in March. A long period of time. It seems like now we've got a probably a good period of time, which is about three months or so.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Herbert Hoover. He fascinates me because going into the presidency, he was about as accomplished an American as there ever been on the world stage. And yet he was overwhelmed by the job of the presidency.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: That's correct. Herbert Hoover had been very distinguished for his relief efforts in Europe after World War 1. He was considered an incredibly intel\u2013 talented person. He was a great Secretary of Commerce, and people thought he should be President of the United States. He was President of the United States. But then he was frozen. He couldn't really deal with the Great Depression when it arose, and he really was driven out of office overwhelmingly. And even after he lost, he kept trying to get Roosevelt to listen to him and say, we should do this together as two presidents. But Roosevelt ignored that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Grover Cleveland. There's not a chapter in the book about Grover Cleveland. Is there anything that retroactively fascinates you about the Cleveland Presidency now that Trump has returned to office? Or are you similarly fascinated by the time in which he was president, the Gilded Age?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, Grover Cleveland is not that well known to many people. In fact, one time there's a story about- where- that Tip O'Neill said to Ronald Reagan, when he's giving me a tour of the- of the Capitol, he said, this is the desk that was Grover Cleveland's. And Reagan said, oh I played him in a picture. And he said, no, that was Grover Cleveland Alexander. But Grover Cleveland was a Democrat, former governor of New York, very well respected. But he lost the election in 1888 and they came back in 1892. Now, one of the things we don't really know is whether a president, when he has a second term after he's been out of office, whether he'll be fresher, whether he'll bring better people, win, whether he'll be more experienced, for example\u2013\u00a0 And the second- most second terms have problems.",
      "Ronald Reagan sec-\u00a0 second term, had problems. Bill Clinton's had problems. Obviously Richard Nixon did, because maybe the people get tired and they're not as sharp as they are or the fresh people come in and they're not experienced. Now you're going to have a whole new administration coming in, a fresh perspective when you've got an experienced president. We just don't know what the impact will be. Grover Cleveland's second term was reasonably successful and, you know, maybe Trump's will be as well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things the nation struggled with this last 18 months or so was the collision of politics and the law. Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from this clash? And the politics that came from a clash of trying to indict and try someone who had been President of the United States and was aspiring to that office again?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think there is a feeling among many people that it wasn't a good idea to indict the president of the United States. I think the trial in New York, where Trump was convicted, I think really helped him in his election effort. I think it emboldened a lot of his supporters who say the Justice Department - in that case, it wasn't\u00a0 the Justice Department, it was the prosecutor in New York. But it is really politicizing the legal system. And I think there are many people who are- who are Trump supporters who believe that the indictments that came out of the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, were really political as well. And so I think there's both sides feel that the other side is really talking past each other. The people who are in the Justice Department now feel that these indictments were fair and correct and have special prosecutor and so forth. The Trump people believe they were completely political. I hope that going forward that the Justice Department is not seen as political because one of the strengths of this country has been the rule of law. One of the reasons people come to this country is we're seen as a place where has a rule of law. There's the American dream. You can rise up and so forth. But people aren't prosecuted for their political views. And I hope that the Justice Department that's coming in now will continue that tradition. I realize many people on the other side would say, the Trump side would say that we're just going to do what what was done to us. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope we basically go back to the rule of law. And everybody feels that if there's prosecutions, they're really legitimate and they're not because of political reasons.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you fear that this process is undercut the national faith in that system of justice?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, our system has been around for a couple of hundred years. It's not going to fall apart that quickly. But I do hope that we can find ways to bring the country together. Donald Trump cannot get reelected under our current laws. You could change the Constitution, but in the current laws, he can't get reelected. And by the end of his second term, he would be,",
      "you know, 82, 83 years old, presumably wouldn't want to run again anyway. So I think that he has the ability to step back and say, I'm going to do what's best for the country. I'm going to campaign a certain way. I did campaign a certain way, but now I'm going to do certain things for the country. And I think a lot of people who are not Trump supporters would say, I hope he will take that perspective. I want to do what's best for the country. And now I don't have to worry about reelection. I'm really going to do things that are best for the country. And I am confident they will do that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Based on your study of the presidency, do you think we rate presidents on their initiatives or external events that knock them off their initiatives?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, most presidents plan certain things and then events come along and they can't predict them. I mean, Jimmy Carter did not predict the hostage takeover, and that really, really ruined his presidency, probably prevented him from being reelected.",
      "Most presidents will find international events will overcome what they expected, or sometimes domestic events. George W Bush had a Great Recession that he could not have anticipated, and the economy almost collapsed. He couldn't have anticipated that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: He also had 9/11.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Right, 9/11, he couldn't-",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2014to be a domestic president focusing on education and the economy.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: That's correct. And then we all got into overseas wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that were never anticipated. So I believe that you cannot predict what's going to happen. And you have to have good people who are willing to worry about what's good for the country. And they have a leader who is always focused on what's best for the country, not what's best for me, what's best for the country.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have a president in mind who, based on your study, grew in your regard? And a President, in your mind, who, based on your study, got more diminished?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Harry Truman left office extremely unpopular, very unpopular, and he was thought to be a- a inappropriate successor to the great FDR. Now, because of books by David McCullough and other people have written great books about Truman, people see him as one of our great presidents, because post-World War II, he helped end the war because he dropped the atomic bomb, which many people say was a mistake. But I would say many historians think it was necessary to avoid\u2014",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And he never doubted.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He never doubted. He never had self-doubt. Self-doubt was one- was not one of his things. He always believed it was the right decision. But he also was responsible for NATO, the UN, the World Bank, the IMF, and the CIA, which he created as well. All these things, he created\u2014",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The recognition of Israel.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes, he recognized Israel even though his secretary of state threatened to resign over it. George Marshall said, I will resign over this, though he didn't. And it was the State- the entire State Department was against the re- the recognition of Israel. So he was a person who's really risen up. A person who's gone down, I would say there are two that have gone down a lot. One is Andrew Jackson. Remember, Democrats used to say, we're going to have a Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner. You don't have that anymore because Jackson is now widely seen as being racist and very anti Native American. And he really did many things that I think killed a lot of people, particularly in the- in the Native American community. So he's not really well respected today by scholars. Another person I would say is- is that, whose reputation has gone down is Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the great reformer after being president of Princeton. Two years later, he's- he's governor of- of- of New Jersey, then president of the United States. However, he now is widely seen as having done two things that were really big mistakes. One, he resegregated the federal workforce and had been integrated. Two, and this was very damaging, I think, as well. He- he had a stroke with about 18 months to go. He couldn't really do what he had done before. He hid that from the public and his wife essentially became a shadow president. She was really making decisions and deciding things that maybe he should have decided. And the public didn't know this, and that was a big problem.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You often ask biographers what question they would most want to pose to the subject of their presidential biography. Let me expand on that. If you could go to dinner with any president, who would it be, and what question would you want to make sure you got answered?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Without doubt, the greatest president and the greatest American, ever, is Abraham Lincoln. He was a person who was not an abolitionist, but ultimately came to free the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. And he also won the Civil War, despite the fact that many people in the North didn't really want to fight the Civil War. They say, let the South go. We'll have our own country. Lincoln said, no, we're going to hold the union together. And he did that. We lost 3% of our population in the war, but he kept the union together, and I think, made the United States a stronger country as a result. We ended slavery eventually because of the 13th Amendment. But most importantly, he did it with humility. He didn't run around saying, look, I just won the Civil War. I just did the Gettysburg Address. Isn't that a great speech? He didn't do that. He didn't brag about it. He was very humble. And I think he had a sense of humor and a sense of perspective that is a really good thing for presidents. So he would be far the person I would want to have dinner with. And I would like to ask him, do you have any regrets about not having freed the slaves earlier? Do you have any regrets about not getting rid of some of your generals earlier, who were not very good, and yet he waited a couple of years before he got Ulysses S. Grant in. Grant is also a person I should mention. He had the most amazing meteoric rise of almost anybody who's become president. He was selling firewood on the streets of St. Louis in 1860. The war breaks out in 1861, more or less, and eight years later, he's president of the United States. I mean, it's just amazing.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned humility. George W. Bush told you in your interview with him that that was the most important characteristic a president can possess. I've read other words that are important for presidents: courage, compassion, curiosity, decisiveness. Based on your study, what would you say is the most important?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the most important thing is having a perspective that you really want to do what's right for the American people. You're not trying to make money. You're not trying to feather your own nest. You're not trying to worry about history. You're just trying to do what's best for the American people. The qualities that I admire in leaders are people who are reasonably intelligent, but not geniuses, you don't need to be a genius to be a great president. People who are willing to listen to other people. People that have some humility. People that are highly ethical. Those are the qualities that I think great leaders have in any area. And certainly president of the United States. And interestingly, the United States has had a limited number of people to serve as president. 47 people served as president of the United States. But we've had a lot of very, very talented people that have not served as president of the United States. Do we really get the best people to serve or not? I think no country gets absolutely the best people in its population to always serve, because being president is a complicated thing. Great geniuses may not want to be president of the United States. Great leaders may say, I'd rather do something at a university or a foundation or a company. I don't want to really be somebody the political constraints that a president has. But for- overall, we've gotten some pretty talented people who've served as president of the United States, and we've been fortunate. Lincoln, Washington, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Jefferson, and modern day presidents, Eisenhower, among others, have had some really great attributes, and the country's good, and I think, better off for having had good people serve. And one of my concerns in the future is that because it's become so political in Washington sometimes and they fight- infighting has been so intense, that I'm not sure as many good people want to rise up and run for president in the future as we've seen in the past.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Picking up on that, do you have a sense of which system has produced better presidents: the party system, meaning the bosses, or the primary system in which voters are in charge?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, the primary system is one that we would say is good because everybody has a chance to vote. And the backroom system that we had years ago isn't so wonderful. But the backroom system did produce some pretty good people, too. So I don't know that there's any one that's better than the other. But I do think that when you have more transparency about who should be president and who's running and who's getting money from people, I think that's probably a good thing. Transparency generally is a better thing than- than having things be obfuscated.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned in your very first answer, the Civil War, the greatest time of testing in our country's history. You don't have to be very aggressive online to find casual talk among Americans about another civil war. They bandy it about with some frequency. How worried are you about that? And do you think the mere discussion of it creates the potential of an inevitability?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think there has been discussion. Some people say the red states and the blue states should separate, but I don't think that's realistic or really going to happen. I think the country realizes that we are the strongest power in the world economically, militarily, politically, culturally, and part because a country's got a big enough population and part because we have a lot of attributes in red and blue states. I don't think it's realistic. People talk about that, but I don't think that's going to happen. The country is not going to be split up the way it was in the Civil War. I just don't see that as being realistic or desirable.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any doubt in your mind that presidents, all presidents, must guard against bitterness, anger, resentment, some of the things that fueled their pursuit of the office in the first place? Meaning once they got there, they need to set those things aside, even though they were part of the engine?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Everybody goes through life and has ups and downs, and you get a lot of bitterness and you get resentment of people. People that are good presidents hopefully rise up above that. A lot of people criticize Abraham Lincoln for many, many things. They called him all kinds of terrible names. And they did say he was barely human. And\u2014",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Called him a gorilla.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes. And he rose above that. And I think you have to rise above it. And hopefully, when you don't have to worry about politics anymore, in a second term, for example, you can rise above all the concerns you've had. Resentment is- is a wonderful thing in life for a couple of minutes, and then you should get over it. And you know, I'm resenting some things from time to time and I try to get over it. When you're president of the United States, if you carry your resentments too long, it can affect other people adversely. So I think in the case of President Trump, for example, clearly he has some resentments. But I think overall, I believe he's going to rise above that in his second term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is Richard Nixon, which you in your book describe as a tragic figure, almost a Shakespearean- like tragic figure, the most-available cautionary tale about resentments and the presidency?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Richard Nixon, as I said in the book- if only Shakespeare had been alive to write about Richard Nixon, it would have been a wonderful tragedy. Here's a man who's really talented, very smart. He stumbles running for president in 1960, barely loses, loses for 1962 in the governorship of California and comes back and is elected in 1968 against all the odds. But he resented the people that looked down on him. He resented the liberals. He resented the 'Ivy Leaguers,' as he would call them. And he really, I think, took those resentments and he perpetuated them through his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, and other people. And the result was a terrible thing called Watergate. I think Richard Nixon, had he not had Watergate, I think he would have gone down as a really impressive president because of the opening to China, things he did on the environment. But Watergate will be what he's remembered for.",
      "Sadly, it didn't have to happen. And actually it - amazingly, that he didn't have the supporters that Donald Trump has on Capitol Hill. For example, Donald Trump has enormous support among his Republicans on Capitol Hill. Richard Nixon really didn't have that kind of support. Had Richard Nixon burned the tapes before they were subpoenaed, I suspect he would have stayed in office, because nobody would have believed what was in the tapes. And he probably would have been within his legal right to get rid of those tapes because they weren't subpoenaed at that time. And for national security reasons, he could have said, 'I've got to destroy them.' But he didn't believe that the Supreme Court would ever take away the tapes from him. And he always was using them, I believe, to help write his- his memoirs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Was he the least ethical president in our history?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think there's- that's easy to say because some presidents had, uh, issues that we don't know about as much. For example, Warren Harding. Warren Harding was widely seen as having tolerated a lot of scandals in his administration. Ulysses S. Grant, while an honest man, tolerated a lot of unethical behavior. He just\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Of his subordinates and friends.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yeah. So I don't know that- Grant was honest himself, but he was not- he was too trusting of certain people in his administration. Harding was widely thought not to be the most honest of politicians. Richard Nixon, um, wasn't a person who was trying to make money for himself necessarily. He wasn't grafting himself into- into business deals and so forth. But I think he had some ethical failings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You worked on the Carter campaign and within the Carter White House. How did that inform your curiosity about other presidents, and did it harden or soften your sense of how difficult the job is?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, when you work in the White House as I did, when I was 27, you realize what an incredible job it is and how powerful the position could be. You also recognize that you make a mistake, you know, the whole world knows about it. So I began to be intellectually curious about the presidency when I worked there, but I was interested in it before. I'd always been interested in the presidency. But when you work in the White House and you see a president up close, it does tend to keep you interested in it. And I've lived in Washington ever since I left the White House. And so I've always been interested in meeting presidents, talking to presidents. And I do a lot to kind of support presidential memorials and monuments and so forth. And so it's just been a part of my life that I think is very enjoyable to me.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You've talked to biographers and presidents. Who's more candid?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Biographers are probably going to be more candid for sure. But presidents, when they get to the latter stages of their life and they can look back with some dispassionate views on things, I think they can be honest. I think Bill Clinton has a book out now about his post-presidency, and I think he's pretty honest about his failings and some of his mistakes that he made. I think Jimmy Carter, before he was- inability, inability to talk really right now, he can't really communicate. But I think he recognized some of his failings after he left office and so forth. I think when you have perspective of being out of office for ten years, 20 years, 30 years, it makes you much more open to being honest about what really happened.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Presidents right after they leave are pretty defensive.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Of course, because when presidents leave right away, they are still trying to defend their image. And I think it's a very important thing for them. And remember, we have a unique system. No other country in the world perpetuates their former leaders in quite the way we do. We have large presidential libraries and other things like that. And these are a way for our leaders to kind of perpetuate their image. And I don't think it's a terrible thing, but I- I do think we should recognize you're going to take 10 or 20 years before somebody has a perspective that will be really honest about how they performed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: President Trump told you it's a lonely job to be president, but Trump's a loner. Everyone knows that. He says that about himself. And as your book reveals and other books have, the presidential story is full of very close advisers, friends, confidants. Do you regard the presidency as lonely a job as Trump described?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: People have often said it's the loneliest job in the world. That may be an exaggeration, but it's a very lonely job because in the end, you're making the final decision. As Harry Truman said, 'The buck stops here.' When you make that final decision, you can't really say, 'Well, somebody else made it for me,' or 'I really didn't make that decision. My staff did it.' You did it. And you have to, in the end, sit down and think about what you're going to really want the country to do. And you have to make that decision. It's a very lonely process.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does the job change the president or does the president change the job?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the job changes the president more than the president changes the job, because you've got a gigantic federal bureaucracy, several million employees. You've got a gigantic military arsenal you've got to oversee as well. And you've got the world events that are- that are around the globe that are going to change things. So I think the presidents, when they come in, they have great plans and they have the best intentions, but sometimes it's just very hard to get these things done.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The book's called 'The Highest Calling.' Is the presidency the highest calling? Some might argue that an age defining innovation is a higher calling, or being a captain of industry is a higher calling, or just being a simple CEO employing tens of thousands of people is a higher calling. Why is it the highest calling?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The reason I called it the highest calling (and I had historically said the private equity, my profession, was the highest calling, but that was more tongue-in-cheek) is this: when Woodrow Wilson went to Paris to help end World War One, he was cheered by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Parisians, and people for the first time realized the most important person in the United States, in the world really, is the president of the United States. And that's been true almost since Wilson came back from Paris. When FDR was running the world really effectively because he was president of the United States during World War Two, he was the most important person in the world, for sure. And I think ever since then, because of the economic, military, political power of the United States, whoever is the leader of the United States is almost certainly the most powerful person in the world and pursuing what I would call the highest calling, because you can affect the lives, lives of people so much more significantly as president of the United States than any other job in the world.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last question: What makes a president's legacy, the presidency or the persons that president places on the Supreme Court?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well the Supreme Court justices live 10, 20, 30, 40 years after a president. So they do have a big impact. But in the end, I think what the president does with his own actions, as opposed to putting people on the court, is probably going to be his biggest legacy or her biggest legacy in the future. There's no doubt, though, that some justices on the court have been there for a long time, and they really have shaped policy in ways that people couldn't have anticipated when they went on the court. But I think the president of the United States, really what he does when he's president of the United States, not just the appointments, but what he's done in terms of policies he's implemented and pursued is probably the biggest legacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Thank you very much.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: My pleasure. Thank you."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Jan. 10 in TikTok's challenge of a law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular platform.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok urged the Supreme Court on Friday to find unconstitutional a new law that could lead to a ban of the widely popular app in the United States, arguing that shuttering TikTok will silence not only its speech, but also that of the platform's more than 170 million American users. President-elect Donald Trump also filed a separate brief in which he stated that he opposes the ban at the current moment and requests time to resolve the dispute via political negotiations.",
      "In an opening brief filed with the justices, which provides a first look at the arguments TikTok will make to the high court next month, lawyers for the platform urged them to reverse a decision from a three-judge appeals court panel that upheld the ban.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok said in their filing that they \"do not contest Congress's compelling interest in protecting this nation's security, or the many weapons it has to do so. But that arsenal simply does not include suppressing the speech of Americans because other Americans may be persuaded.\"",
      "In its own filing\u00a0laying out arguments for upholding the ban, the Justice Department argued the law is consistent with the First Amendment and said the government has a compelling interest in preventing threats to national security posed by control of TikTok by a foreign adversary, China.",
      "The law, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote, \"addresses the serious threats to national security posed by the Chinese government's control of TikTok, a platform that harvests sensitive data about tens of millions of Americans and would be a potent tool for covert influence operations by a foreign adversary. And the Act mitigates those threats not by imposing any restriction on speech, but instead by prohibiting a foreign adversary from controlling the platform.\"",
      "The high court said last week that it would take up TikTok's challenge to the ban, which was passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. The company had asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block the law and urged it to intervene before Jan. 19, when the prohibition is set to take effect.",
      "The justices said they will consider whether the measure violates the First Amendment, and scheduled two hours of arguments for Jan. 10, an expedited timeline that could bring a ruling soon after. In addition to TikTok's challenge, the Supreme Court will consider a separate bid by a group of the platform's users to block the ban.",
      "The case will be argued in the final days of the Biden administration, but Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has expressed support for TikTok. Trump tried to ban the app during his first term in office, but reversed his position during his campaign. The president-elect vowed to \"save\" the app, and told reporters earlier this month that he has \"a warm spot in my heart for TikTok.\"",
      "In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court, a lawyer for Trump, D. John Sauer, said he opposes banning the platform in the U.S. \"at this juncture\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" Trump announced in November that he plans to nominate Sauer to serve as solicitor general in his second term.",
      "The president-elect asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's Jan. 19 effective date to allow his new administration to \"pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"",
      "Citing the Jan. 19 deadline, Trump said it interferes with his \"ability to manage the United States' foreign policy and to pursue a resolution to both protect national security and save a social-media platform that provides a popular vehicle for 170 million Americans to exercise their core First Amendment rights.\"",
      "Lawmakers sought to restrict access to TikTok in the U.S. amid concerns about its ties to China. The platform is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, and members from both parties, as well as intelligence agencies, have warned that the app could give the Chinese government access to data from the roughly 170 million Americans who use TikTok. They have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used by the Chinese government to covertly manipulate content on the platform and influence public dialogue.",
      "Under the law, TikTok had nine months to divest from ByteDance or lose access to all app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The measure allows the president to grant a one-time, 90-day delay if a sale is in progress by Jan. 19.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that divesture is not possible, and the Chinese government has vowed to block the sale of the platform's powerful algorithm, which tailors content recommendations to users.",
      "Brought in May, TikTok argued in its challenge to the law that it violates the First Amendment rights of the platform and its users. The company also said Congress targeted it with its ban, which would bar every American from participating in its \"unique online community.\"",
      "But a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, and found that the government's national security justification for the law is consistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote for the unanimous court. \"Here the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "Ginsburg, joined by Judge Neomi Rao, tapped by Trump, and Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, appointed by President Barack Obama, said that while the decision will have significant implications for TikTok and its users, \"that burden is attributable to [China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. government.\"",
      "The dispute has attracted a range of friend-of-the-court briefs from members of Congress, civil liberties groups, former national security officials and TikTok users.",

      "In a Dec. 11\u00a0Senate hearing, Manger testified that there had been more than 50 so-called \"swatting\" attacks on members of Congress over the previous month.

      "\"You've got, you know, a bunch of law enforcement officers that are pounding on the door, kicking in a door, and again, that's a recipe for disaster, and it's a recipe for chaos, and it's a recipe for somebody innocent to get hurt or killed,\" Manger said.",
      "Manger said that Capitol Police were often receiving multiple swatting cases per day.",
      "\"These are occurring all over the country,\" Manger said. \"And so, yeah, it certainly got our attention.\"",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday afternoon that her agency will need to start taking \"extraordinary measures\" or special accounting maneuvers intended to prevent the nation from hitting the debt ceiling as early as Jan. 14.",
      "\"Treasury expects to hit the statutory debt ceiling between January 14 and January 23,\" Yellen wrote in a letter addressed to House and Senate leadership, at which point extraordinary measures would be used to prevent the government from breaching the nation's debt ceiling\u00a0\u2014 which has been suspended until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "The department has in the past deployed what are known as \"extraordinary measures\" or accounting maneuvers to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out the government risks defaulting on its debt unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.",
      "\"I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" she said.",
      "The news comes after President Biden signed a bill into law last week that averted a government shutdown but did not include President-elect Donald Trump's core debt demand to raise or suspend the nation's debt limit. The bill was approved by Congress only after fierce internal debate among Republicans over how to handle Trump's demand. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country,\" Trump said in a statement.",
      "After a protracted debate in the summer of 2023 over how to fund the government, policymakers crafted the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which included suspending the nation's $31.4 trillion borrowing authority until Jan. 1, 2025.",
      "Notably however, Yellen said, on Jan. 2 the debt is projected to temporarily decrease due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments. As a result, \"Treasury does not expect that it will be necessary to start taking extraordinary measures on January 2 to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations,\" she said.",
      "The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion \u2014 which ballooned across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

      "That designation by the U.S. government was made official in October.",
      "Fogel is currently serving a 14-year sentence in Russia for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Who is Marc Fogel?",
      "When the Butler County native and his wife flew back to Russia in August 2021 for their 10th and final year of teaching in the country, Marc Fogel was detained at the airport in Moscow after his family said he was carrying 17 grams of cannabis for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "The Oakmont teacher was convicted of drug smuggling and drug possession and sentenced to 14 years at a high-security penal colony in Russia.",
      "Fight to bring Marc Fogel home",
      "Ever since his imprisonment, Marc Fogel's family and lawmakers have been urging lawmakers to bring him home.",

Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",
      "In December 2022, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a prisoner swap that included WNBA player Brittney Griner, but Marc Fogel was not included in the deal.",

      "What does wrongfully detained mean?",
      "Wrongfully detained is a designation that puts the full force of the U.S. government behind securing the release of the prisoner.",
      "According to the U.S. Department of State, once a person has been determined to be wrongfully detained, offices \"throughout the State Department and other U.S. government agencies will work collaboratively with colleagues inside and outside the government to develop a strategy to secure their release.\"",
      "Getting the determination is very rare, as most cases of Americans being arrested or detained overseas \"arise out of legitimate law enforcement and judicial processes,\" according to the government.",
      "Malphine Fogel sued the government in June in an effort to get her son home from Russia, but the lawsuit was dismissed on Thursday.",
      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",
      "It also means the case gets transferred to a division known as the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, which is focused on negotiating for the release of detainees and hostages around the world.",
      "But there is no clear timeline on how long it takes to release someone.",
      "What lawmakers are saying about Marc Fogel",

      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",

      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

    "summary": "An ancient shipwreck that dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. has been removed from waters off Spain, two decades after its discovery in 1994.",
    "story": [
      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

      "A NASA spacecraft made history and is safe after making the closest-ever approach to the sun. On Tuesday, the Parker Solar Probe\u00a0hurtled through the sizzling solar atmosphere and passed within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles of the sun's surface.",
      "Just before midnight Thursday, scientists at NASA\u00a0received a signal from the probe after it had been out of communication for several days during its burning-hot flyby.",
      "NASA said the spacecraft was safe and operating after its historic flight on Christmas Eve and noted Parker is expected to send back detailed telemetry data on its status on New Year's Day.",
      "Parker got more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, traveling at a maximum speed of about 430,000 mph. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).",
      "It will continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Since it was launched, Parker has been using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.",
      "Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the sun's surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun.",
      "The\u00a0Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Before this week's historic milestone, Parker had flown straight through the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse.",
      "The sun's warming rays make life possible on Earth. But severe solar storms can temporarily scramble radio communications and disrupt power.",
      "The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, triggering colorful auroras in unexpected places.",

      "Lamenting the contretemps, International Chess Federation President Arkady Dvorkovich said in a statement Sunday that he'd let World Blitz Championship tournament officials consider allowing \"appropriate jeans\" with a jacket, and other \"elegant minor deviations\" from the dress code.",
      "He said Carlsen's stand \u2014 which culminated in his quitting the tournament Friday \u2014 highlighted a need for more discussion \"to ensure that our rules and their application reflect the evolving nature of chess as a global and accessible sport.\"",
      "Carlsen, meanwhile, said in a video posted Sunday on social media that he would play \u2014 and wear jeans \u2014 in the World Blitz Championship when it begins Monday.",
      "\"I think the situation was badly mishandled on their side,\" the 34-year-old Norwegian grandmaster said. But he added that he loves playing blitz \u2014 a fast-paced form of chess \u2014 and wanted fans to be able to watch, and that he was encouraged by his discussions with the federation after Friday's showdown.",
      "\"I think we sort of all want the same thing,\" he suggested in the video on his Take Take Take chess app's YouTube channel. \"We want the players to be comfortable, sure, but also relatively presentable.\"",
      "The events began when Carlsen wore jeans and a sportcoat Friday to the Rapid World Championship, which is separate from but held in conjunction with the blitz event. The chess federation said Friday that longstanding rules prohibit jeans at those tournaments, and players are lodged nearby to make sartorial switch-ups easy if needed.",
      "An official fined Carlsen $200 and asked him to change pants, but he refused and wasn't paired for a ninth-round game, the federation said at the time. The organization noted that another grandmaster, Ian Nepomniachtchi, was fined earlier in the day for wearing sports shoes, changed and continued to play.",
      "Carlsen has said that he offered to wear something else the next day, but officials were unyielding. He said \"it became a bit of a matter of principle,\" so he quit the rapid and blitz championships.",
      "In the video posted Sunday, he questioned whether he had indeed broken a rule and said changing clothes would have needlessly interrupted his concentration between games. He called the punishment \"unbelievably harsh.\"",
      "\"Of course, I could have changed. Obviously, I didn't want to,\" he said, and \"I stand by that.\"",

      "The former president had been receiving hospice care at his home for nearly two years following a series of short hospital stays.

      "\"They didn't want Ed Muskie or Hubert Humphrey or Scoop Jackson or George Wallace,\" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. \"They were tired of those people that had been in the national spotlight for so long. So, he came at America as a fresh new face.\"",

      "In 1976 \u2014 America's bicentennial year \u2014 he defeated President Gerald Ford to become the 39th president of the United States. The Carters conveyed that they were of the people when they marched in the open air on the inaugural parade route.",
      "\"His greatest asset as a candidate was his outsider status,\" Brinkley said. \"And his greatest failing as a president was the fact that he remained an outsider, when you must be an insider in Washington if you're going to be an effective president.\"",
      "He struggled to cultivate relationships in Washington and feuded openly with Democratic leaders in Congress. As oil prices and inflation soared, his popularity sank.",

A U.S. military attempt to free them ended in disaster, with eight American servicemen killed in a crash. The crisis dominated Carter's reelection campaign, while the economy continued to struggle and inflation topped 18%.",
      "In the final days of his administration, the president and his team negotiated freedom for the hostages. They were released on Ronald Reagan's Inauguration Day.",

      "He and Rosalynn built houses with Habitat for Humanity, dedicating their efforts to the group for more than 30 years, and he penned more than 20 books.",
      "He sparked controversy with his 2006 book \"Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\" in which he characterized Israel's treatment of Palestinians as oppression. He later issued an open apology to the Jewish community, saying that suggestions for improvement should not stigmatize Israel.",
      "In 2007, Carter spoke at the funeral of his former political rival turned close friend and confidante, former President Ford.",

He also had some major accomplishments, including the negotiation of a peace deal between Egypt and Israel.",
      "But it is his widely lauded post-presidency, characterized by tireless peace and humanitarian efforts, that is likely to be his most enduring legacy.",

He was an early and vocal critic of the war in Iraq begun under President George W. Bush, and he opposed the Obama administration's use of drone strikes to target suspected terrorists.",
      "He criticized Trump for \"exacerbating\" racial tensions and being \"careless with the truth,\" telling CBS News' John Dickerson in 2018, \"I think I went through my campaign and my presidency without ever lying to the people or making a deliberately false statement, and I think that would be a very worthwhile thing to reinsert into politics these days.\" He added that he wished Trump well \"and I pray for him.\"",
      "Carter joined fellow past presidents in condemning the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and he marked the date one year later by writing: \"I now fear that what we have fought so hard to achieve globally \u2014 the right to free, fair elections, unhindered by strongman politicians who seek nothing more than to grow their own power \u2014 has become dangerously fragile at home. \u2026 For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct.\"",
      "Carter wrote 33 books, including memoirs about his life and career, as well as books on other topics like faith and aging.",
      "He and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years, and were known for their devotion to one another. They are survived by their four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "I'm Major Garrett, in for Margaret Brennan.",
      "As we close out 2024, we, of course, want to look ahead to the economy, health care, immigration, so much more, as Washington ushers in a new Congress and, importantly, a new administration.",
      "We begin with a Face the Nation tradition, our year-end correspondents roundtable.",
      "Joining us, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, political correspondent Caitlin Huey-Burns, and senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe.",
      "It is great to have you all with us.",
      "Scott MacFarlane, I want to start with you.",
      "The new Congress will be sworn in this week. What position does Mike Johnson, the current speaker of the House, find himself in seeking reelection to that position?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It's a tenuous position. It has the prospect and promise of having high drama Friday, when they begin the new Congress January 3 by choosing the new speaker.",
      "One of the most underappreciated and underreported issues of the 2024 election was this incredibly narrow margin Republicans preserved in the U.S. House, even more narrow than the one that gridlocked them over the past two years.",
      "And, of course, the first order of business is choosing a speaker. Republicans have just one or two votes to spare on anything. That has the possibility of paralyzing things. And we saw two years ago the speaker vote was like a \u2013 it's like Gilligan's Island. It was supposed to be a three- hour vote and ended up being a multi-arc drama with many divergent characters, not including Thurston Howell.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: But here's the thing. It's just the top layer of this very treacherous cake for them is picking a speaker, because, what does this next speaker have to concede to win that post?",
      "We saw over the last two years the prior speaker had to concede positions on the pivotal Rules Committee to some contrarian voices in the Rules Committees, where bills went to die, instead of to get set up for a vote. And that's why so many Democratic votes were needed for so many pivotal things, because the Rules Committee was jammed up by contrarians.",
      "That could happen again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa, I want to turn to you, because, if he were so inclined, president-elect Trump could clarify his preference here. And that would send an important signal to those Republicans in the House majority to be still on the fence about this, yet he remains conspicuously silent.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: That decision is reflective of the dynamic right now down at Mar-a-Lago, the president's retreat in Florida.",
      "There is high drama, as Scott reports, on Capitol Hill. But, in Trump's inner circle, it's almost like the low-key second season of a TV show. That's how it's been described to me by allies of president-elect Trump. He's being guided by Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff.",
      "And she's created, I'm told, this atmosphere of calm when it comes to some of the nominees, the process, laying out the agenda for next year, top of the agenda, tax cuts, trying to expand those Trump tax cuts from 2017, of course, mass deportations also part of Trump's plan, a border bill as well.",
      "And you do have controversial nominees in Kash Patel for the FBI, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services, among others. But, at its core, you have a president-elect who's now comfortable with power, comfortable with the people around him.",
      "This is so different, Major, than what we saw in 2016, when we were covering that transition period. It had this theatrical element, Trump welcoming people to Bedminster for these showy appearances and interviews.",
      "Now we rarely see the president-elect. He's firing off missives at times on TRUTH Social, his platform, but he's often behind the scenes getting ready for 2025, because he's been here before. He knows what he wants to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe, President Biden remains president of the United States, though some Americans might have to be reminded of that fact.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What is ahead for the president in the waning days of his presidency in terms of travel and possible pardons?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Well, he is taking one final foreign trip, and it was one that we \u2013 those of us who followed him a long time anticipated might happen. And that is a trip to the Vatican to see the pope and then to see the Italian leadership as well.",
      "They have been in far closer contact than I think many people appreciate, because the pope, like the president, shares a lot of the concerns about the state of the world, about what's going on in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Conflict, climate change.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely, yes, and state of democracy and just general concern for social justice, which is\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Refugee flows, exactly.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, exactly.",
      "And so that will be a critical political meeting, but also a real personal capstone for the second Catholic president.",
      "And it speaks as well to one of the things he's been focused on over the last several weeks and will continue to be. We're still waiting to hear more about, for example, pardons and clemency. Will there be more of those? And will they be for the everyman? Or will they be for notable political figures like, for example, Jesse Jackson Jr., the former congressman from Illinois, or others who've ended up in the legal system and maybe are well- known and are now appealing for some kind of leniency or forgiveness?",
      "And so those 37 death row clemencies that we saw before Christmas, a good example of what's to come and what he's eager to do, and also a good example of what little he can do, because, of course, Congress has no interest in working with him. They can't even really sort out what to do with themselves, but \u2013 so he's using the executive privileges that he has in these waning weeks.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, as you know better than anyone at this table, this last year was a clash of law and politics, unlike anything we have seen in our modern American history.",
      "The judicial system in our country, according to Gallup, 35 percent confidence, 20 percent below our peer countries, other free market democracies. How much of that is a reflection of this clash, the Supreme Court, or just a sense that our judicial system has become, in the words of someone we have all come to know, two-tiered?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, that's a hard question to answer, because I think you have got a\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We always give you the easiest ones, Jan.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: But I'm going to try, Major, because I think it goes \u2013 you have got to look past just this past year and go further back.",
      "I think it really started and took off in the wake of the Dobbs decision, the court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The outrage over that decision was so extreme that you saw, I think, a quite calculated effort to undermine legitimacy of the Supreme Court by Democrats, Senate Democrats, for example, hearings, stories about scandals, some of which were pretty overblown, to say the least.",
      "So, that has an impact on public opinion. The public starts to believe that this court is corrupt, that this is \u2013 it's on the take, none of which is true. I mean, this is still a court. You may disagree with their decisions. It's a very conservative court. It is not a corrupt court.",
      "These are nine justices who have very different views on how to interpret the Constitution who are kind of in this Titanic struggle over law, not politics.",
      "Even the immunity decision, I mean, that decision was so misreported to say that the court was going to save Trump from a criminal trial. No, it wasn't. That was never the decision. In fact, that decision is going to help protect Joe Biden from any future prosecution by Donald Trump if he wanted to do that.",
      "So, when we look at public opinion polls, sure, the court's taken a hit, but that's true over the years. The court often takes a hit. So do other institutions. And the court's opinion \u2013 court's public opinion remains much higher than our other institutions, including the White House, Congress, and by far the news media.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Congress at 17 percent, according to Gallup.",
      "Caitlin, Jan mentioned the Dobbs decision. One of the things that roiled through the political calendar year of 2024 was how important, how impactful would that decision be on turnout and the ultimate outcome of the election?",
      "But, as you traveled the country, you kept telling us, yes, it's an important issue, but there are other things on the minds of women voters in this country.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, we always say that voters have the capacity to think about a lot of different things at once.",
      "And we saw, in the wake of that decision in the midterms, that was top of mind for people. It was the first way to kind of exercise their views across the country on this issue. But, this time around, voters had different ways to express their feelings about the Dobbs decision.",
      "Many of them had ballot measures in their states, a couple of those states being battleground states, that they could vote for codifying abortion rights into their state law and also vote for Donald Trump, because they believed in his views on the economy, on immigration, or at least that he could solve some of their concerns about them.",
      "And as I spoke to women across the country, as we all spent the whole year talking to voters and really listening to voters, a lot of women talked to me about how concerned they were about safety, about the economy, a lot of them responsible for their family's budgets, paying the bills, going to the grocery store, these kinds of fundamental things.",
      "And, also, it was kind of a reminder that we have been treating women as kind of a monolithic group in the wake of Dobbs. And this election showed that it's not as such, that they do care a lot about safety, the economy. Those were overarching issues, but they also do care about women's rights, abortion rights, but they just had other avenues to express that.",
      "And that's really what helped. And Donald Trump also modified his positions, at least to satisfy some of those voters, at least that I spoke to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert, Caitlin brought up women's concerns about security. That flows through immigration.",
      "I wonder what your perspective is on this online feud that's gone on, on for the last three or four days between parts of the MAGA universe over H- 1B visas, which are essentially visas set aside for high-skilled laborers, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and nominally president-elect Trump on the side of that, hard right nativist parts of the MAGA movement using expletives on social media typically reserved for their political foes, not for those in the MAGA tent, assailing one another.",
      "What do you make of all of that?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The coalition that lifted Donald Trump back to power included Silicon Valley executives. Elon Musk, Trump inner circle members say, deserves a lot of credit for pouring a lot of money in the final months into the campaign.",
      "But at the end of the day, this was a campaign where so many voters at rally after rally we covered were holding up signs that said \"Mass Deportations Now.\" The message was obvious, it was in your face.",
      "And for \u2013 the idea that president-elect Trump is going to back away from his immigration position because of some whisper in his ear from a Silicon Valley billionaire, it's just not happening, based on my reporting.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Scott, very quickly, do you think that \u2013 we have got about 30 seconds before we need to go to break. How much do you think that will be a part of the early congressional conversation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think this battle over the debt limit which Elon Musk weighed in on is going to be the first throw-down of 2025 and impact the first year of Trump's term, because they're going to need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling.",
      "That won't satisfy the Elon Musks of the world. I'm not sure how Trump circumvents Democratic concessions for the debt ceiling.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When we come back, you know it, you love it, predictions, biggest story, things that were undercovered with our outstanding correspondents panel.",
      "We will be back in just one moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation and our correspondents roundtable.",
      "Predictions.",
      "Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I think the biggest story to watch this coming year is how the president-elect when he becomes president handles immigration.",
      "We talked a lot about how the economy was the overarching theme of this election. Immigration is what Trump made his not only closing \u2013 closing argument on, but his entire campaign was really rooted in immigration.",
      "So what this looks like, we saw in our polling majority support for mass deportations. What does that actually look like? And how do they handle that once we see what that looks like on television, how they have people explaining their policy, and what those stories look like because of that, and whether the base is satisfied and whether the general public gets what they voted for on that.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jan, 2025 prediction.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I will go back to the court.",
      "I think that Donald Trump will probably get his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court either this year or maybe next year, when\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Because someone retires.",
      "Who?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Justice Sam Alito.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: He was nominated, took the bench in 2006, after nearly two decades on the court.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Most importantly, Marcus Freeman and the Fighting Irish will win the Sugar Bowl on January 1.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Now, this is normally my prediction with Alabama.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I'm stepping into your territory. But\u2026",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm happy to give it to you.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Governing by crisis in 2025.",
      "Ed, when we first met over a decade ago, we were covering crisis on Capitol Hill. Crisis persists. Such a handful \u2013 and Caitlin Huey-Burns as well. And Scott was there as well.",
      "Look, they only have a handful of seats in the House for the Republican majority. They can only do so much, as Scott said, debt limit battle on the horizon, spending fights. Deja vu. That culture of crisis, governing to the brink of discussions is here again.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: I will make the firmer prediction that, based on all that chaos, Speaker Johnson won't be speaker by the end of 2025.",
      "Did that a few years ago on Paul Ryan, and it worked. So, watch out, Speaker Johnson. Nothing personal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be careful, Speaker Johnson. Be advised.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: But just look at \u2013 look at what faces him.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "ROBERT COSTA: \u2026 real soon.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "ED O'KEEFE: The other one real quick, Washington Commanders will get a stadium here in the District of Columbia, because that congressional vote that authorized land\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Happened right before Congress adjourned.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: It sure did. And it was a great surprise at D.C. It'll happen this year.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott MacFarlane.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Long before the next election, there will be some people departing Washington voluntarily. This is a challenging environment to be an elected official.",
      "They're getting thousands of threats a year on their lives, on their families. The travel is exhausting. And we're coming into a relatively polarizing moment with Trump coming back into office. You're going to see a lot of retirements in odd-numbered years, including 2025.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think that's one reason why you're going to see Justice Alito step down.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things we also do in the year-end correspondents roundtable is dig into what was undercovered or underreported.",
      "Jan?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Undercovered and underreported, that would be, to me, Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline that became undeniable in the televised debate.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: At the presidential debate with Donald Trump.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Unquestioned.",
      "And it's starting to emerge now that his advisers kind of managed his limitations, which has been reported in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" for four years. And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats.",
      "It could have changed the scope of the entire election. Yet still, incredibly, we read in \"The Washington Post\" that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump. And I think that is either delusional or they're gaslighting the American people.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: President Biden has said repeatedly he was sick during the debate June 27 in Atlanta and he's always been fine and he leaves fine.",
      "That is his position, the position of many of his top aides as well, even though there is that reporting.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: The biggest story that's underreported, the battle for working voters across the country.",
      "I spent a lot of time this year with Shawn Fain, the head of the UAW. That's the battle of the future. Who's going to win over that person who's aligned with labor? Are the \u2013 the industrial worker in this country. Is it going to be the Democratic Party or the Republican Party? It remains a key story, deserves more attention.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Caitlin Huey-Burns.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I mentioned how we covered women voters, but also I think there is an aspect to which we underestimated or perhaps the public underestimated how Trump's personality wasn't as much of a burden to him.",
      "And, in some ways, it turned out to be a benefit with low-propensity voters. And talking to the Trump campaign throughout the cycle and reporting on it, they were making this bet that, if he leaned into his personality and made no qualms about it, made no apologies about it, that would kind of speak to this authenticity factor, this premium that low- propensity voters, those not inclined to participate in elections, might be inclined towards.",
      "It was a big bet. It paid off. And it will remain \u2013 the biggest question I have is whether Republicans can replicate any of that, because so much of their political wins this year are unique to Donald Trump himself.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Scott MacFarlane, underreported.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The scope and size and political impact of these forthcoming January 6 pardons.",
      "Trump has never specified if it's everybody or just some people. Will it include people who gassed and beat police officers with baseball bats, or will it just be those who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors? He's never been pressed to specify if it's all or some. And what's the political impact?",
      "Did his voters really want that? Does he gain political capital or lose it if he pardons everyone?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Ed O'Keefe.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Once again, we don't cover the Western Hemisphere enough and why it is that people come from the far reaches of South America.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What is the gravitational pull of the United States in those particular countries?",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Exactly.",
      "And it's going to be more critical than ever in the coming year that we continue to explore and explain why it is they continue to do so, despite the threats of being sent back.",
      "And watch also the cooperation between a lot of those countries, especially in Central America, with the United States and the intrigue they have over the first Latino secretary of state, the most senior Latino ever to serve in an administration and in the presidential line of succession, Marco Rubio.",
      "I heard within days of the election from Latin American governments quite eager to get on the good side of Marco Rubio because they are thrilled to know there will be more attention paid to the hemisphere, as there should be.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And there will be attention paid in terms of accepting those this administration incoming intends to deport.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Sends them back.",
      "Yes, that \u2013 because they understand that's the gateway.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: To better relations with this administration.",
      "ED O'KEEFE: Yes, that, if you start with that, and ensure that they're being treated fairly on their way back, that they will probably end up taking them.",
      "No formal agreements yet, but they're willing to have the conversation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: No better way to close out a calendar year than to have the correspondents roundtable here at Face the Nation. It's been my honor and privilege to have you all here.",
      "Ed O'Keefe, Caitlin Huey-Burns, Scott MacFarlane, Robert Costa, Jan Crawford, my thanks to all of you.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Last week, the U.S. reported its first severe case of bird flu found in a patient in Louisiana.",
      "For more, we're joined by Dr. Leana Wen. She is the former Baltimore health commissioner.",
      "Dr. Leana Wen, it's great to have you with us.",
      "So, bird flu, is this report out of Louisiana worrisome? And, if so, why?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): Well, it's one more sign that the drumbeat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat.",
      "So, we've already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. Sixteen states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive.",
      "And now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing. So, we really don't know the extent of bird flu that's out there in humans.",
      "But this particular case, it's someone who is severely ill, but not only that. Researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.",
      "Bird flu has been around for a long time, but it hasn't\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: About 30 years.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, exactly.",
      "But it hasn't been a major issue in humans, because while it spreads among birds, it hasn't really spread among mammals. But now there is this mutation. And there's another concern now, Major, too which is that we're in flu season, and it's possible that a single person could have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Something called reassortment\u2026",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right. That's right.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2026 where things change because of one illness becoming another illness through reassortment of a mutated virus.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: That's right.",
      "And so the viruses could exchange genes. You could develop a new hybrid virus. And if you now have a virus that's more contagious and causes more severe disease, that's when it becomes a major threat to humankind.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Yes, there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have left.",
      "The first is to get testing out there. I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that, just because we aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. It just means that we aren't looking for it. We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farmworkers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not.",
      "And the second very important thing is, this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn't have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost five million doses of the vaccine.",
      "However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so \u2013 and to farmworkers and to vulnerable people.",
      "I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing?",
      "I mean, that's a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available, so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, the World Health Organization estimates that, in prior outbreaks of the bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52 percent, 52 percent.",
      "However, in the \u2013 in this most recent outbreak, it seems that most cases have been mild, and maybe some people even have asymptomatic infection. But the question is, we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more vulnerable individuals.",
      "People infected so far in the U.S. have been mainly farmworkers, who are working, presumably generally healthy, as opposed to what happens when you get to children, to pregnant women, to older individuals with chronic illnesses.",
      "We don't know how deadly, how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And, again, that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Thirty seconds.",
      "Norovirus is what you call it. Stomach bug is what I would call it. Numbers are surging. It's the holidays. What should people do to protect themselves?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Wash your hands really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose.",
      "Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the U.S. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And, also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting and diarrhea stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. We really appreciate it.",
      "We will have more questions for Dr. Wen when we come back, but, first, we're going to take a quick break.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with Dr. Leana Wen and a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Dr. Leana Wen.",
      "Doctor, you talked about vaccines and testing in the context of bird flu and preparations therefore. Vaccines and testings were part of the Covid conversation and the Trump administration, when it was in charge.",
      "What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of vaccine, testing, public health, efficacy?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN, (Former Baltimore Health Commissioner): I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very competent. For example, Dr. Marty Markary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, we have worked together for the last ten-plus years on issues like hospital medical error (ph). He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.",
      "But I have a lot of concern, and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti- vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti-vaxing advocates in the country, if not in the world over the last couple of decades.",
      "He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a scientist. And what I mean is that, if you're a scientist, even if you have deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind if there are new facts that are presented.",
      "It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are lifesaving. A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccination have saved over 1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. According to a Lancet (ph) study, childhood vaccines saved 154 million lives globally over the last 50 years. I mean these are facts. And it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the - in how science works and basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation's preeminent scientific and medical agencies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: With that perspective, do you believe it's more imperative than you described earlier for the Biden administration to move forward on bird flu vaccinations and testing?",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Well, that's exactly it, I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence. Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe as we could be having for bird flu the way that we had for Covid.",
      "There's no reason why we should hold off on getting more testing. We need to know how much bird flu there is out there. We need to know if there are new mutations that are being developed. Other countries also need to know so that they can prepare as well.",
      "And I think it's a major problem that in the U.S. we have been holding back on testing and also holding back on getting the vaccines deployed that are already developed.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Dr. Leana Wen, thank you so much for your expertise. Thanking you twice. And a Happy New Year to you.",
      "DR. LEANA WEN: Thank you. To you, too, Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We'll be right back.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the economy and what to expect in year 2025. We do so with Bank of America senior economist Aditya Bhave.",
      "Aditya, good morning. It's great to see you.",
      "I've covered a lot of presidential transitions. There's always an assessment by the outgoing president about what kind of economy he's giving to his successor. That's a political conversation. Objectively, what is the economy the incoming Trump administration inheriting?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE (Senior U.S. Economist, Bank of America): Good morning. Thank you for having me.",
      "So, we think the economy has really solid momentum going into next year. You can look at our internal card data, for example, that shows a nice acceleration in spending going into the holidays. You can also look at the TSA on airport traffic, and that looks really strong around the holiday period as well.",
      "You can also think about things via a wider lens. Start in 2022. That was a year in which GDP grew by only 1 percent. CPI inflation peaked at 9 percent. And all of the talk back then was stagflation, when, not if, is a recession going to arrive. Why are workers quiet quitting. And then you look at what happened over the following two years, right. This was quite unexpected and in a very pleasant way. Three percent GDP growth. Inflation coming down. Labor productivity moving up. So, all positives that leave us optimistic going into next year that we can continue to grow above 2 percent, albeit with somewhat sticky inflation.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any larger x factor in 2025 than the scale and scope of promised mass deportations of the Trump administration?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: From a market perspective, I think the two biggest issues will actually be fiscal policy and trade policy. And there's a lot of uncertainty around those as well, just as there is around immigration policy. So, with fiscal policy, you had this conversation in your last segment, right, the majority for Republicans in the House is very, very narrow. So, if they want to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they want to do more fiscal stimulus, which we think will probably eventually get done, they have a very slim margin to work with.",
      "And then with trade policy, we really need to understand, you know, how much of the tariffs that President-elect Trump has threatened are actually going to be implemented versus how much is a negotiating tool, right, so how much is transactional.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And for mass deportations, how much do you fear that could affect the labor market and our country, that is to say put upward pressure on prices because if there is mass deportations and workplace inspections, lots of workers in agriculture, construction, meat processing and other vital industries could be pulled out of those sectors.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, I think it's - our base (ph) case is that there will be a slowdown in the flow of immigrants, right? It's harder to know what will actually happen around deportations.",
      "From an economic perspective, a worker is also a consumer, so there are some down risks to economic activity if there's a large change in the population, right? That's just math.",
      "In terms of pressures in specific sectors, it's really going to depend on how things play out. Yes, there could be labor shortages in certain sectors, but it's very hard to know at this stage.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Many CEOs I listen to say that they expect the tariffs and regulatory relief to kind of wash themselves out, meaning essentially, you put them together, it's benign on the U.S. economy. Is that your perspective?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I think that's about right. If you look at the four key policy issues that we've been focused on, as I said earlier, trade, fiscal policy, immigration policy and deregulation, we think they'll roughly wash out. But again, the starting point is pretty helpful, right? So, we think that we can continue to grow at around 2 to 2.5 percent this - the coming year, as well as in 2026.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, in reading year-end summaries, \"The Economist,\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post,\" all in their own way, warned that the stock market may be overvalued, may be to exuberant. Do you share any of those concerns?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: I'm not an equity analyst, so it's hard for me to day, to give a specific number. Our equity strategists do think that stocks can continue to run up to around 6,600, 6,700 by the end of the year.",
      "What you can say is that, obviously, there's been a pretty aggressive run- up in tech stocks, but it is not of the same scale that we saw in the late '90s if we're really worried about a similar bubble.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What effect do you believe cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence will play in the global economy in 2025?",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: So, when it comes to A.I., I think there's two things to be said. The actual impact of A.I. adoption is probably going to show up pretty slowly in the data. So, I don't know that we'll necessarily see that in 2025 or 2026. It might be a story for a few years down the line.",
      "But what has been really impactful already, and probably will be much more impactful in the coming years, is just laying the groundwork for A.I., right? So, if you see the increases in investment in data centers, and you think about what all that requires, right?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes. We need to -",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires materials. It requires energy supply.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Aditya, we need to go. Pardon - pardon me.",
      "ADITYA BHAVE: It requires labor, you - you put - sure. Sure.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, I'm sorry to cut you off. We have a hard break we need to get to.",
      "Aditya Bhave from Bank of America, Happy New Year and thank you so much for being with us.",
      "We'll be right back in just a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: In 22 days Donald Trump will be sworn in as the nation's 47th president, only the second to serve two nonconsecutive terms.",
      "For more perspective on the most powerful position in the world, we spoke with David Rubenstein, the co-founder and co-chairman of the Carlyle Group. His new book, \"The Highest Calling,\" studies the highs and lows of some of this country's most consequential presidents.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How would you compare, based on your study of the presidency, our unsettled times now to unsettled times past?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN (Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, The Carlyle Group): Well, nothing is as bad as the Civil War, when we had 3 percent of our population killed and the fighting in Washington was so bad that about 60 different times members of Congress hit other members of Congress on the floor of the Congress. So, we're not quite there yet.",
      "Clearly, though, we're going into some uncharted waters because we have a president coming back who had been president before. That hadn't happened since Grover Cleveland was re-elected in 1892. And Trump has got more power than I think many people would have thought by the virtue of his victory size. And I do think he's going to act like he's got a mandate and Washington is bracing for what's going to happen.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Related to that, before the election results were known, polls indicated pretty consistently that Trump supporters were afraid if Harris would win, Harris supporters were afraid if Trump would win.",
      "Based on your study of this institution, the presidency, can you recall a time where that fear of an outcome was as prevalent as it was leading into this election?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, there have been a couple times when people really were afraid that the next person coming in that was the opposite party would really hurt the country in many ways. Clearly, my former boss, Jimmy Carter, really feared Ronald Reagan. He thought that Ronald Reagan was going to do - undo many of the things that Carter had done. Obviously, Reagan won by a landslide.",
      "And you've seen other times when this has happened as well. So, for example, when FDR won the first time, Herbert Hoover could not believe that this man, Herbert Hoover, had been such a distinguished American before he was president, and while he was president he had problems, but he was a very distinguished person. He never took FDR seriously. And FDR didn't really take Hoover that seriously. He refused to really meet with him, essentially, or met with him briefly and they just didn't want anything to do with him - each other.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned Grover Cleveland. There's not a chapter in the book about Grover Cleveland. Is there anything that retroactively fascinates you about the Cleveland presidency now that Trump has returned to office, or are you similarly fascinated by the time in which he was president, the Gilded Age?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Grover Cleveland was a Democrat, a former governor of New York, very well respected, but he lost the election in 1888, and he came back in 1892. Now, one of the things we don't really know is whether a president, when he has a second term after he's been out of office, whether he'll be fresher, whether he'll bring better people in, whether he'll be more experienced.",
      "For example, Grover Cleveland's second term was reasonably successful. And, you know, maybe Trump's will be as well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things the nation struggled with this last 18 months or so was the collision of politics and the law. Do you think there are any lessons to be learned from this clash and the politics that came from the clash of trying to indict and try someone who had been president of the United States and was aspiring to that office again?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think there is a feeling among many people that it wasn't a good idea to indict the president of the United States. I think the trial in New York, where Trump was convicted, I think really helped him in his election effort. And I think there are many people who are - who are Trump supporters who believe that the indictments that came out of the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, were really political as well.",
      "And so I think there's - both sides feel that the other side is really talking past each other. The people who are in the Justice Department now feel that these indictments were fair and correct and had a special prosecutor and so forth. The Trump people believe they were completely political. I hope going forward that the Justice Department is not seen as political because one of the strengths of this country has been the rule of law, and I hope that the Justice Department that's coming in now will continue that tradition.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have a president in mind who, based on your study, grew in your regard and a president in your mind who, based on your study, got more diminished?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Harry Truman left office extremely unpopular, very unpopular, and he was thought to be an inappropriate (ph) successor to the great FDR. Now, because of books by David McCollough and other people who have written great books about Truman, people see him as one of our great presidents because post-World War II he helped end the war because he dropped the atomic bomb, which many people say was a mistake, but ki would say many historians think it was necessary to avoid -",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And he never doubted?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: He never doubted. He never had self-doubt. Self-doubt was one of - was not one of his thing. He always believed it was the right decision. But he also was responsible for NATO, the U.N., the World Bank, the IMF, and the CIA, which he created as well. All these things he created",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And the recognition of Israel.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes, he recognized Israel, even though his secretary of state threatened to resign over it. So, he was a person who has really risen up.",
      "A person who's gone down, I would say, or two that have gone down a lot. One is Andrew Jackson. Remember, Democrats used to say, we're going to have a Jefferson-Jackson day dinner. You don't have that anymore because Jackson is now widely seen as being racist and very anti-Native American, and he really did many things that I think killed a lot of people, particularly in the Native American community. So, he's not really well respected today by scholars.",
      "Another person I would say is - is that - whose reputation has gone down is Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was the great reformer after being president at Princeton, two years later he's - he's governor of New Jersey, then president of the United States.",
      "However, he now is widely seen as having done two things that were really big mistakes. One, he resegregated the federal workforce and had been integrated. Two, and this is very damaging I think as well, he - he had a stroke and with about 18 months to go, he couldn't really do what he had done before. He hid that from the public, and his wife essentially became a shadow president. She was really making decisions and deciding things that maybe he should have decided, and the public didn't know this. And that was a big problem.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You often ask biographers what question they would most want to pose to the subject of their presidential biography. Let me expand on that. If you could go to dinner with any president, who would it be, and what question would you want to make sure you got answered?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Without doubt, the greatest president and the greatest American ever is Abraham Lincoln. He was a person who - was not an abolitionist but ultimately came to free the slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation. And he also won the Civil War despite the fact that many people in the north didn't really want to fight the Civil War. They'd say, let the south go, we'll have our own country. Lincoln said, no, we're going to hold the union together. And he did that. We lost 3 percent of our population in the war, but he kept the union together and I think made the United States a stronger country as a result.",
      "We ended slavery eventually because of the 13th amendment. But, most importantly, he did it with humility. He didn't run around saying, look, I just won the Civil War. I just did the Gettysburg Address. Isn't that a great speech? He didn't do that. He didn't brag about it. He was very humble. And I think he had a sense of humor and a sense of perspective that is a really good thing for presidents.",
      "And I would like to ask him, do you have any regrets about not having freed the slaves earlier? Do you have any regrets about not getting rid of some of your generals earlier who were not very good? And he waited a couple years before he got Ulysses S. Grant in.",
      "Grant is also a person I should mention. He had the most amazing meteoric rise of almost anybody who's become president. He was selling firewood on the streets of St. Louis in 1860. The war breaks out in 1861, more or less, and eight years later he's president of the United States. I mean it's just amazing.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned humility. George W. Bush told you in your interview with him that that was the most important characteristic a president can possession. I've read other words that are important for presidents - courage, compassion, curiosity, decisiveness. Based on your study, what would you say is the most important?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I think the most important thing is having a perspective that you really want to do what's right for the American people. You're not trying to make money. You're not trying to feather your own nest. You're not trying to worry about history. You're just trying to do what's best for the American people.",
      "The qualities that I admire in leaders are people who are reasonably intelligent but not geniuses. You don't have to be a genius to be a great president. People who are willing to listen to other people. People that have some humility. People that are highly ethical. Those are the qualities that I think great leaders have in any area.",
      "Overall, we've gotten some pretty talented people who have served as president of the United States. And we've been fortunate. Lincoln, Washington, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Jefferson, and modern day presidents, Eisenhower, among others, have had some really great attributes and the country is good and I think better off for having had good people serve.",
      "One of my concerns in the future is that because it's become so political in Washington sometimes and the fight - infighting has been so intense that I'm not sure that - as many good people want to rise up and run for president in the future as we've seen in the past.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned in your very first answer the Civil War, the greatest time of testing in our country's history. You don't have to be very aggressive online to find casual talk among Americans about another civil war. They banty it about with some frequency.",
      "How worried are you about that, and do you think the mere discussion of it creates the potential of an inevitability?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Well, I think there has been discussions. Some people say the red states and the blue states should separate, but I don't think that's realistic or really going to happen. I think the country realizes that we are the strongest power in the world economically, militarily, politically, culturally and, in part, because the country's got a big enough population, and in part because we have a lot of attributes in red and blue states. I don't think it's realistic. People talk about that, but I don't think that's going to happen. The country is not going to be split up the way it was in the Civil War. I just don't see that as being realistic or desirable.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is there any doubt in your mind that presidents, all presidents, must guard against bitterness, anger, resentment, some of the things that fueled their pursuit of the office in the first place? Meaning, once they got there they need to set those things aside, even though they were part of the engine?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Everybody goes through life and has ups and downs. And you get a lot of bitterness and you get resentment of people. People that are good presidents ultimately rise up above that. A lot of people criticized Abraham Lincoln for many, many things. They called him all kinds of terrible names and they did say he was barely human.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: They called him a gorilla.",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: Yes. And he rose above that. And I think you have to rise above it. And, hopefully, when you don't have to worry about politics anymore in a second term, for example, you can rise above all the concerns you've had. When you're president of the United States, if you carry your resentments too long, it can affect others people adversely. So, I think in the case of President Trump, for example, clearly he has some resentments, but I think overall I believe he's going to rise above that in his second term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Is Richard Nixon, which you, in your book, describe as a tragic figure, almost a Shakespearean-like tragic figure, the most available cautionary tale about resentments in the presidency?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: If only Shakespeare had been alive to write about Richard Nixon, it would have been a wonderful tragedy. He's a man who's really talented, very smart. He stumbles from running for president in 1960, barely loses. Loses for 1962 in the governorship of California and comes back and is elected in 1968 against all the odds.",
      "But he resented the people that looked down on him. He resented the liberals. He resented the ivy leaguers, as he would call them. And he really, I think, took those resentments and he perpetuated them through his chief of staff, Rob Haldeman and other people. And the result was a terrible thing called Watergate.",
      "I think Richard Nixon, had he not had Watergate, I think he would have gone down as a really impressive president because they opened to China, things he did on the environment. But Watergate will be what he's remembered for.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Was he the least ethical president in our history?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: I don't think there's - that's easy to say because some presidents had issues that we don't know about as much. Richard Nixon wasn't a person who was trying to make money for himself necessarily. He wasn't grafting himself into - into business deals and so forth. But I think he had some ethical failings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The book is called \"The Highest Calling.\" Is the presidency the highest calling? Some might argue that an age defining innovation is a higher calling or being a captain of industry is a higher calling, or just being a simple CEO employing tens of thousands of people is a higher calling. Why is it the highest calling?",
      "DAVID RUBENSTEIN: The reason I called it \"The Highest Calling,\" and I had historically said that private equity, my profession, was the highest calling, but that was more tongue-in-cheek, is this. When Woodrow Wilson went to Paris to help end World War I, he was cheered by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Parisians. And people, for the first time, realized the most important person in the United States, in the world, really, is the president of the United States. And that's been true almost since Wilson came back from Paris.",
      "When FDR was running, the world really effectively, because he was president of the United States during World War II, he was the most important person in the world for sure. And I think ever since then, because of the economic, military, political power of the United States, whoever is the leader of the United States is almost certainly the most powerful person in the world, and pursuing what I would call the highest calling because you can affect the lives of people so much more significantly as president of the United States than any other job in the world.",

      "Cases are ticking up on land, too. The Minnesota Department of Health recently logged 40 cases of norovirus, which is twice the usual number for December, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "Here are a few things to know about the virus.",
      "Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, responsible for 58% of such infections acquired in the country each year, according to the CDC.",
      "Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner in Baltimore, shared some best practices for people to protect themselves against the disease on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday.",
      "\"Wash your hands, really well, especially if you're going to buffets. Wash your hands if you're touching commonly touched surfaces, before you touch your mouth, before you touch your nose,\" said Wen. \"Norovirus is the most common foodborne illness here in the U.S. It's very hard to avoid once it's in your family. And, also, don't prepare food if you're having vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, because you don't want to spread it to other people.\"",
      "Norovirus infections are caused by a group of viruses that spread easily, with as few as 10 viral particles having the ability to make someone sick, health experts say.",
      "There are about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks reported annually in the United States. The outbreaks can occur throughout the year but are most common from November to April.",
      "Along with vomiting and diarrhea, common symptoms include nausea, stomach pain, body aches, headache and fever.",
      "Most norovirus outbreaks occur when people who are already infected spread the virus to others by direct means, such as through sharing food or eating utensils. Outbreaks can also be spread through food, water or contaminated surfaces.",
      "Illness caused by norovirus typically starts suddenly, with symptoms developing 12 to 48 hours following exposure to the virus. Most people get better within one to three days and recover fully.",
      "But with 19 to 21 million illnesses each year in the United States, norovirus nevertheless causes on average 900 deaths and 109,000 hospitalizations annually, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. It also leads to 465,000 emergency department visits, mostly involving young children.",
      "People of all ages can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the top concern.",
      "There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended by drinking water and other liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea and alcohol.",
      "Anyone suffering from dehydration should seek medical help. Symptoms of dehydration include a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing. Dehydrated children may be unusually sleepy or fussy and cry with few or no tears.",
      "Rigorous and frequent handwashing is the best defense against norovirus during the peak winter season, scrubbing the hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds before meals.",
      "Scrubbing surfaces with household disinfectants can also help.",

      "I did not have a strong gender identity when I was small. I drew pictures and played with my large family of stuffed animals, to whom I assigned family roles. I read the adventures of the boy reporter Tintin, but I also read the purely quotidian adventures of Martine, a sort of Everygirl, which must have been sent by a relative. I have a distinct but vague memory (I couldn't tell you the year or even the country) of being somewhere with my parents and picking something up \u2014 a magazine? a record? \u2014 with a girl's face on it, and them laughing at me. I certainly took it as a warning to avoid displaying pictures of girls \u2014 to not, say, tack up pictures of Fran\u00e7oise Hardy all over my room, after my paternal aunt and uncle, small-town newsagents, began sending me the French teen magazine Salut les copains. But I didn't really know what the laughter meant. Were they laughing because it seemed suspiciously feminine that I would be interested in a girl on a magazine? Or was it because it seemed precociously heterosexual? That second one did not occur to me at the time.",
      "But I was never pushed in any conspicuously masculine direction, either. Despite his interest in sports (he was an avid basketball player in his youth, although 5'2\"), my father didn't seem to care that I felt no pull in that direction, and we never engaged in the traditional male bonding experiences, not even tossing a ball back and forth. He also never taught me any of his skills: carpentry, plumbing, painting, paperhanging, even shoe repair (he had at one point apprenticed with a cobbler), although that had more to do with class than with gender. The way he saw it, I would grow up to be an important person who would have laborers to do those things for him. He was eager that I extricate myself from the working class and earn my pay from the comfort of a desk chair. He had no objections to my being a writer \u2014 he was a frustrated writer himself, who in 1948 had published an O. Henry-like sketch in a newspaper under the byline \"Luc Sante.\"",
      "My mother never taught me her skills, either, not even allowing anyone into the kitchen when she was cooking. But then her mother and her aunt had been legendary cooks and she was forever made to feel like the graceless idiot daughter; her repertoire of dishes was limited to recipes written down by her mother. Naturally she would not have wanted to be observed in her daily race against failure. I'm certain my mother wanted me to be a girl.",

    "story": [
      "A passenger plane burst into flames Sunday morning after it skidded off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing 179 of the 181 people on board, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters.",
      "The National Fire Agency said rescuers raced to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane in the town of Muan, about 180 miles south of Seoul. The Transport Ministry identified the plane as a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that was returning from Bangkok when it crashed at 9:03 a.m. local time.",
      "At least 179 people \u2014 84 women, 82 men and 11 others whose genders weren't immediately identifiable \u2014 died in the fire, the South Korean fire agency said. Emergency workers pulled out two people, both crew members, from the tail of the plane and local health officials said they remain conscious.",
      "Among the 179 bodies found, officials have so far identified 88 of them, the fire agency said. The authorities said the severity of the crash made it difficult to identify the bodies.",
      "South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that there were believed to be 173 South Korean passengers aboard the flight and two Thai nationals. There were also six crew members aboard the flight, Reuters reported.",
      "Lee Jeong-hyeon, chief of the Muan fire station, told a televised briefing that the plane was destroyed, with only the tail assembly remaining recognizable among the wreckage.",
      "Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. Local TV stations aired footage showing thick pillows of black smoke billowing from the plane engulfed with flame.",
      "Workers were looking into what caused the crash, including whether the aircraft was struck by birds that caused mechanical problems, Lee said. Senior Transport Ministry official Joo Jong-wan separately told reporters that government investigators arrived at the site to investigate the cause of the crash and fire.",
      "Transport Ministry officials later said the plane had first attempted to land, but the control tower issued a bird strike warning. It ascended before trying to land again. Two minutes later, the plane sent a \"mayday\" distress signal and attempted to land on a different runway. It landed on the runway three minutes later without lowering its landing gear.",
      "The aircraft failed to reduce its speed until it reached the end of the runway, veered off and, collided with a fence wall, and was set ablaze",
      "Jong-wan said workers have retrieved the flight data and cockpit voice recorders of the plane's black box, which will be examined by government experts investigating the cause of the crash and fire. He said it may take months for investigators to complete their probe. The runway at the Muan airport will be closed until Jan. 1, the ministry said.",
      "Thailand's prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident through a social media post. Paetongtarn said she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.",
      "Acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok ordered an all-out rescue response, Reuters reported. Choi\u00a0only became acting president Friday, replacing the previous acting president, Han Duck-soo, following Han's impeachment. It all comes in the wake of the government crisis caused by the\u00a0Dec. 3 martial law declaration\u00a0from former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was later impeached as well.",
      "In an emergency meeting on Sunday evening, Choi declared a national mourning period until Jan. 4, Reuters reported.",
      "Jeju Air in a statement expressed its \"deep apology\" over the crash and said it will do its \"utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.\"",
      "In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air's president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologized to bereaved families and said he feels \"full responsibility\" for the incident. Kim said the company hadn't identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular checkups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.",
      "President Biden, in a statement on Sunday, said he and first lady Dr. Jill Biden are \"deeply saddened\" about the loss of life as a result of the crash.",
      "\"As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by this tragedy,\" he said. \"The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance.\"",
      "This is one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea's aviation history. The last time South Korea suffered a large-scale air disaster was in 1997, when a Korean Air plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board.",
      "This comes after 38 people were killed and 29 more injured when an\u00a0Azerbaijan Airlines plane\u00a0bound from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan, on Christmas Day. On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0issued an apology\u00a0for the crash, and the Kremlin said in a statement that air defense systems were firing near Grozny airport as the airliner \"repeatedly\" attempted to land there.

      "Authorities in Brazil launched an investigation after three women died and several others were hospitalized after a family ate an arsenic-laced Christmas cake, police told local media.",
      "The three women \u2014 who local media said were ages 43, 58 and 65 \u2014 died after eating the cake at a family get-together on Dec. 23 in Torres, a small seaside town in southern Brazil.",
      "The woman who baked the cake, along with a 10-year-old child who also ate the cake, remain in the hospital and are receiving treatment for poisoning.",
      "The civil police sent the cake for testing and said laboratory tests also showed arsenic levels in blood samples taken from the three victims.",
      "Police said they also found several out-of-date food items during a search of the woman's house, CBS News' partner BBC reported. Police added that it is not yet clear whether the poisoning was intentional.",
      "Tests from the cake are expected next week.",
      "The news website G1 said police were waiting until the hospitalized woman's condition improved to question her. Testimony had meanwhile been taken from 15 other people as part of the investigation.",
      "So far, no charges have been laid and police have not said whether it was being treated as a murder case.",
      "Reports said the woman who made the cake got along well with the other members of the family, and there was no early indication of a dispute.",
      "The BBC, citing Brazilian media, said police chief Marcos Vinicius Veloso said some of the family members complained that the cake had a \"peppery\" taste.",
      "Images provided by police and posted online showed a partially served cake of dried fruit with white marzipan icing and maraschino cherries on top. At the family gathering, only one person did not eat the cake and was not affected.",
      "According to local media, police requested for the body of the late husband of the woman who made the cake to be exhumed. He died in September from food poisoning, and his death was deemed natural at the time by police, BBC reported.",
      "Very low levels of inorganic and organic arsenic are found in many food products, according to the National Institutes of Health. Testing is routine, as slightly elevated levels of either form can cause symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness and muscle cramping.",
      "Inorganic arsenic is more toxic to humans than the naturally occurring form of the mineral arsenic, and the health effects from exposure are more severe, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled inorganic arsenic a carcinogen, or a substance that causes cancer.",

      "Officials are trying to determine what caused the\u00a0Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash\u00a0in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day that killed 38 people on board, leaving 29 survivors. The\u00a0president of Azerbaijan placed the blame on the Russian military, saying that it unintentionally shot down the plane.",
      "Here is what we know so far:",
      "How did the plane crash?",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, an Embraer 190 aircraft, was flying from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the city of Grozny in Russia's North Caucasus region on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that aren't yet fully clear.",
      "It crashed while trying to reach another airport in Aktau, in western Kazakhstan.",
      "Cellphone footage appears to show the aircraft making a steep descent before hitting the ground and exploding in a fireball about two miles from the Aktau airport.",
      "Photos from the scene show the rear portion of the plane's fuselage still intact after the crash, lying upside down in a field.",
      "The airline said 67 people were on board \u2014 62 passengers and five crew members \u2014 and 38 people died in the crash, but 29 of those on board survived.",
      "On Sunday, the president of Azerbaijan said Sunday that the passenger plane was unintentionally shot down by the Russian military. He also accused Russia of trying to \"hush up\" the issue for several days.",
      "\"We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said.",
      "Investigators have recovered both of the so-called black boxes, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, from the crash site.",
      "Why did the plane change course?",
      "There were conflicting accounts of why the plane's pilots diverted the aircraft.",
      "Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, initially said it appeared the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike. Later, Russian and Azerbaijani officials suggested the plane had been rerouted due to fog or bad weather in Grozny. Then Russia also said Ukrainian drones targeting the Grozny area were a factor.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that while it was too soon to know the cause of the crash, bad weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.",
      "\"The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,\" he said.",
      "Dmitry Yadrov, the head of Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic.",
      "Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea, instead.",
      "What do officials and aviation experts say about a possible cause?",
      "Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia all opened investigations into the cause of the crash.",
      "In a statement on Friday, Dec. 27, Azerbaijan Airlines said the plane experienced \"external physical and technical interference,\" but did not say where it believed the interference came from or provide any further details. It announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News there were early indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the plane in a region where Ukrainian and Russian forces have traded drone and rocket fire for months. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said if that proved to be true, it would further underscore Russia's recklessness in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that U.S. officials \"have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.\"",
      "He confirmed to reporters that the U.S. has intelligence or information pointing to the possibility, but said Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are currently conducting the investigation and the U.S. will \"respect that process.\"",
      "Meanwhile, independent aviation experts cast doubt on the bird strike theory, and some pointed to damage seen on the plane's fuselage as evidence it may have come under fire.",
      "\"It certainly does not look like a flock of birds,\" said CBS News aviation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "\"Birds don't fly at the type of altitude that the initial damage occurred on this airplane,\" added Sumwalt.",
      "Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal the damage compatible with shrapnel from a small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system.",
      "\"It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,\" he said.",
      "Kremlin apologizes for \"tragic incident\"",
      "On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to his Azerbaijani counterpart for what he called a \"tragic incident\" but stopped short of saying his country's air defenses were to blame.",
      "Putin's call with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev came after speculation grew that Russian air defense may have accidentally shot down the plane.",
      "In an official statement Saturday, the Kremlin said air defense systems were firing near Grozny on Wednesday due to a Ukrainian drone strike, but stopped short of saying one of these hit the plane.",
      "\"(President) Vladimir Putin apologized for the tragic incident that occurred in Russian airspace and once again expressed his deep and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to the injured,\" the Kremlin said in a statement.",
      "The Kremlin said the call took place at Putin's request.",
      "Survivors heard noises before crash",
      "Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny.",
      "Flight attendant Aydan Rahimli said that after one noise, the oxygen masks automatically released. She said that she went to perform first aid on a colleague, Zulfugar Asadov, and then they heard another bang.",
      "Asadov said that the noises sounded like something hitting the plane from outside. Shortly afterward, he sustained a sudden injury, like a \"deep wound, the arm was lacerated as if someone hit me in the arm with an ax,\" he said. He denied a claim from Kazakh officials that an oxygen canister exploded inside the plane.",
      "Two other survivors recounted hearing explosions before the plane went down: Jerova Salihat told Azerbaijani television in an interview in the hospital that \"something exploded\" near her leg, and Vafa Shabanova said that \"there were two explosions in the sky, and an hour and a half later the plane crashed to the ground.\"",

    "story": [
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the \"toughest\" anti-U.S. policy, state media reported Sunday, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president.",
      "Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts, however, say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.",
      "During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. \"the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.\" Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into \"a nuclear military bloc for aggression.\"",
      "\"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,\" Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "It said Kim's speech \"clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively\" by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security.",
      "KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers.",
      "The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim \"fell in love.\" But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.",
      "North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.",
      "Further complicating efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in return for economic and political benefits is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that 3,000 North Korean troops have been killed and wounded in the fighting in Russia's Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties since the North Korean troop deployment to Russia began in October.",
      "Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
      "Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's \"unchangeable\" hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.",

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said if that proved to be true, it would further underscore Russia's recklessness in its ongoing\u00a0invasion of Ukraine.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday that U.S. officials \"have seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems.\"",

Lawmakers, including Pennsylvania Senators Bob Casey and John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, also have put pressure on President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate his imprisonment as wrongfully detained.",

      "Malphine Fogel sued the government in June in an effort to get her son home from Russia, but the lawsuit was dismissed on Thursday.",
      "What happens next to Marc Fogel?",
      "Once the secretary of state designates someone as wrongfully detained, the U.S. government is required by law to work for their release, and can impose sanctions against the country holding them.",
      "It also means the case gets transferred to a division known as the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, which is focused on negotiating for the release of detainees and hostages around the world.",

      "Osamu Suzuki, the charismatic former boss of Suzuki Motor Corp. who helped turn the Japanese mini-vehicle maker into a globally competitive company, has died, the company said Friday. He was 94.",
      "Suzuki was known for his candid remarks and friendliness, calling himself an \"old guy from a small to mid-size company.\" He became CEO of Suzuki in 1978 and was leading the company when it became the first Japanese automaker to start local production in India, where its cars proved hugely popular.",
      "Born on Jan. 30, 1930 as Osamu Matsuda, Suzuki worked in banking after graduating from Tokyo's Chuo University School of Law. He joined Suzuki Motor, which is based in the central Japanese city of Hamamatsu, in 1958 when he married a daughter of the company's then-president Shunzo Suzuki, who belonged to the company's founding family. As is sometimes the custom in such situations, Matsuda adopted his wife's maiden name.",
      "In 1979, a year after he became Suzuki Motor's fourth company president, he launched an affordable minicar, which became a big hit and was promoted to world markets.",
      "Under Suzuki's leadership, the company's sales grew more than tenfold to 3 trillion yen ($19 billion) in the 2000s.",
      "Suzuki also led business tie-ups with other global leaders such as General Motors and Volkswagen AG in the 2000s. Amid intensifying competition and industrial transformation, Suzuki also formed a capital alliance with Toyota Motor Corp. in 2019 to co-develop self-driving vehicles.",
      "While other Japanese automakers have expanded in the U.S. and Chinese markets, offering a wide range of vehicles, Suzuki has stuck with mini and compact cars, mostly in South and Southeast Asia.",
      "Suzuki stressed the importance of understanding the grassroots level.",
      "\"Making good quality and low-price products is the basis of manufacturing,\" Suzuki once told an interview with the broadcaster NHK television. \"We cannot lower costs while sitting in the offices of president or chairperson, so I have to be in a factory to understand the work and get ideas.\"",
      "Suzuki stepped down as president at age 85 in 2015, handing the post to his son, Toshihiro Suzuki. He served as an advisor to the company after resigning as chairman in 2021.",
      "The company said Suzuki died Wednesday of malignant lymphoma.",

      "With the Camp David Accords of 1978, Carter was able to stand out from his predecessors by notching a success in an area where they had failed.",

It was the first, and it was the most important,\" Indyk, who was once special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under former President Obama, continued.",
      "The Camp David Accords were signed by then-President Carter, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in September 1978, and signaled peace between the two countries. Egypt was considered the largest and most powerful Arab nation at the time.",
      "Negotiations had begun years earlier, in 1973, and were led by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The start of discussions was prompted by the Yom Kippur War, which had proven an expensive conflict for both Israel and Egypt, as well as the Arab countries it led.",

But that proved very difficult to achieve agreement,\" he said. \"And that's when Carter took the risky decision to bring both leaders to Camp David to try to broker a peace agreement between them.\"",
      "The high-risk meeting with both leaders at Camp David was confidential and lasted 12 days.",

      "Fox News' Jonathan Serrie provides details on the outpouring of support for President Jimmy Carter and his family.",
      "In his one term in the White House, the late President Jimmy Carter struck the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, helped take the world further from nuclear proliferation with the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT), signed the Panama Canal Treaties, which ended a century of direct American control over the crucial canal, and deregulated the nation's airline industry.",
      "But Carter, a former Georgia governor who defeated Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election, also confronted the socialist Nicaraguan revolution in Central America and the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, which led to a resumption of Cold War tensions with Moscow and an embargo of the 1980 Summer Olympics by the U.S. And domestically, the one-term Democratic president battled massive inflation known as stagflation, and an energy crisis that led to the return of gas lines across the country.",
      "As Carter struggled to cope with multiple domestic and international crises, the then-president went on national television in July 1979 to deliver what was titled \"the crisis confidence\" address, but was later dubbed the \"malaise\" speech, even though the world malaise never appeared in Carter\u2019s actual address.",
      "Carter called for Americans to return to a sense of civic duty that would unify the country through a call for shared sacrifice for the common good of the nation. While initially giving the president a boost in the polls, the goodwill was short-lived. A couple of days after the address, Carter fired several members of his cabinet and was unable going forward to be seen as a strong and effective leader.",

      "Carter, politically weakened by a fierce and nearly successful primary challenge by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination, was crushed by GOP nominee Ronald Reagan in the general election, with the former California governor sweeping 44 of the 50 states.",
      "Historian and author Craig Shirley, who wrote multiple books about Reagan and Carter, pointed to the economic conditions at the time as a major contributor to Carter\u2019s demise.",
      "\"Interest rates were something like 18%. Inflation was almost as high. The value of a dollar wasn\u2019t worth today what it was yesterday. It was really devastating to people\u2019s savings,\" Shirley spotlighted in a C-SPAN interview a few years ago.",
      "FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER TO SPEND 'REMAINING TIME' AT HOME RECEIVING HOSPICE CARE",
      "Veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, president of New England College, concurred.",
      "\"While it is certainly true that the Carter Administration had its share of successes, such as the Camp David Accords and the Panama Canal Treaty, in the months leading up to the 1980 election, voters were focused on high inflation, low economic growth, an energy crisis and the growing perception that American power and influence in the world was in decline,\" Lesperance said.",

They elected Ronald Reagan whose campaign projected strength, confidence, humor, and a nostalgic appeal to an America as the proverbial shining city on a hill,\" he emphasized.",

      "Carter\u2019s foreign policy wins included brokering Mideast peace by keeping Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at the bargaining table for nearly two weeks in 1978.

    "story": [
      "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover.",
      "Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what\u2019s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you\u2019re not home.",
      "But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose a privacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data.",

      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",

      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",

Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

    "title": "Stuck behind a VPN wall? Let\u2019s find a way around it",
    "published": "Sat, 28 Dec 2024 08:00:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network (VPN) allows computer and smartphone users to mask an IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and the internet.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "A virtual private network (VPN) is a useful tool that allows you to mask your IP and create a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. This means you can browse the web more privately, especially when connected to a public Wi-Fi network. Another use case for VPNs is accessing sites that are blocked in your region. For example, you could be sitting in New York and accessing content on Chinese social media platforms (though I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that). However, a VPN can sometimes have the opposite effect, blocking you from accessing content that you were otherwise able to view.",
      "I recently received an email from Carol in Douglasville, Georgia, who asked:",
      "\"Why am I blocked from seeing a site when I use a VPN? I am being blocked from answering emails I receive from the VA, Social Security and government sites that I need to connect to concerning my benefits.\"",
      "She says she attempted changing servers and even switched to different cities within the U.S., but she still couldn\u2019t access the sites. Carol, that sounds like a serious issue. Understandably, you would want to use a VPN when visiting websites, and not being able to access them can be quite frustrating. This situation may even force you to disable your VPN, which could put you at risk. Below, I\u2019ll discuss why this happens and how you can work around the issue.",

      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A\u00a0virtual private network (VPN) is a secure connection method used to add privacy and security to private and public networks, like the internet and Wi-Fi hotspots. VPNs are often used to protect sensitive data and to ensure that online activities are safe from cyber threats. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online identity, a VPN provides anonymity and protects against hackers, snoopers and data breaches. It also allows you to access content that may be restricted based on your geographic location, making it a great tool for boosting your online privacy and freedom.\u00a0Here are 10 reasons you need a VPN at home.",
      "Why are you not able to access certain websites when using a VPN?",
      "Website owners can decide who gets to access their sites and who doesn\u2019t. Many sites block IPs from known VPNs or data centers, especially if their content is restricted to certain countries or regions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Big platforms like Netflix or banking sites often use VPN detection tools to prevent people from accessing their services anonymously. Government websites do this, too, mostly to prevent people from bypassing regional or national restrictions. For instance, in countries with strict content rules, blocking VPNs helps prevent people from accessing content the government doesn't want them to see.",
      "But even setting your VPN to a different location in the same country doesn\u2019t always work. Why? Because some sites are trying to keep cybercriminals out. VPNs can hide your identity and location, which is great for privacy but can also be misused for fraud. Government websites dealing with things like taxes, voting or benefits need to verify who you are and where you\u2019re logging in from to prevent misuse. Allowing VPNs could make it easier for fraudsters to slip through.",
      "Another reason for blocking VPNs is to keep bots at bay. Bots can use VPNs to scrape government websites or overload their systems. Blocking VPN traffic helps protect sensitive information and makes it easier to trace and authenticate real users.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO USE VPNS WITHOUT COMPROMISING YOUR BANKING APPS",
      "6 ways to bypass VPN blockers",
      "If you're having trouble accessing certain sites with your VPN on, try the steps below. Start from the first step and keep going until the issue is resolved.",
      "Using a reliable VPN service is one of the best ways to work around VPN blocks. Not all VPNs are created equal, and choosing a high-quality provider can make a significant difference. Look for a VPN that offers obfuscated or \"stealth\" servers, which disguise VPN traffic to appear as regular internet usage, making it harder for detection systems to block you.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "A good VPN should also have a large server network with plenty of options across different locations so you can easily switch if one server is blocked. Some services even offer dedicated IP addresses, which are less likely to be flagged compared to shared ones.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO SECURE YOUR HOTSPOT PRIVACY AND SECURITY WITH A VPN",
      "If one server isn\u2019t working, try connecting to another in the same country or region. VPN providers usually have multiple servers, and switching might help you bypass the block. If this doesn\u2019t work, use obfuscated servers. These servers are designed to hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN. They can bypass strict VPN detection systems, especially on government or streaming websites.",
      "To bypass VPN blocks, you can change the connection protocol your device uses. VPN protocols determine how devices link to servers, and some protocols are more adept at evading detection than others.",
      "If you're facing issues accessing specific websites, switching to a different protocol may help. For instance, some protocols offer a good balance of speed and security, while others prioritize faster performance or efficiency, potentially improving your ability to bypass restrictions.",
      "For more detailed information, it's important to research which protocols are best suited for specific use cases, as the effectiveness of different protocols can vary.",
      "WILL A VPN PREVENT APPS FROM TRACKING ME?",
      "If you only need the VPN for certain apps or websites, enable split tunneling in your VPN settings. This lets you access blocked sites using your regular connection while keeping the VPN active for other purposes. For example, you can enable split tunneling to watch a movie on Netflix using your regular internet connection while keeping your banking app secure with the VPN.",
      "Not all VPNs are created equal. Some are better at bypassing blocks than others. If your current VPN isn\u2019t working, consider switching to one that specializes in evading detection.",
      "If all else fails, switch to a mobile data connection or a different network. Sometimes, the issue is with your current ISP (internet service provider) rather than the VPN.",
      "30% OF AMERICANS OVER 65 WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE WEB. HERE\u2019S WHY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "VPNs are great for getting around restrictions, but some websites have blockers to stop VPN traffic. There are a few ways to get around these blockers, and sometimes, it's just as easy as switching servers. You\u2019ll have the best chance of getting your VPN unblocked if you're using a reliable service. They keep an eye on their servers to make sure everything\u2019s running smoothly and offer extra features like dedicated IP addresses.",

This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",

These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you\u2019re like me, your home Wi-Fi is at the center of almost everything you do online, whether it\u2019s online banking, paying bills, booking trips, chatting with friends or streaming movies.",
      "These days, it\u2019s not just your laptop and phone connected to the network, but also things like security cameras, thermostats and even air conditioners are all managed by your router. But be honest, when was the last time you did anything to secure your router? It\u2019s easy to forget about it, especially if it\u2019s working fine. The thing is, a lot of people feel the same way, and a study reveals this \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude could be putting millions at serious risk.",

      "Shocking router security facts you need to know",
      "The\u00a02024 Broadband Genie router security survey has uncovered some startling facts about how internet users approach router security. Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "CLEVER TRICK TO MAKE A CONNECTION FASTER ON YOUR WI-FI NETWORK",
      "Most people don\u2019t know who\u2019s connected to their network",
      "Alarmingly, 75% of users have never checked to see who is connected to their network. With an average home now hosting around 12 connected devices, failing to monitor network activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Even more worrying, three-quarters of respondents do not understand why adjusting router settings is important, showing a significant gap in awareness about the risks associated with default configurations.",
      "\"In 2022, we ran a similar study and found 48% had never touched their router's factory settings. It\u2019s concerning that not only has the number come down after two years, it\u2019s got worse,\" said Alex Tofts, strategist at Broadband Genie.",
      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",
      "A woman working on her laptop computer (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO CHECK IF SOMEONE IS STEALING YOUR WI-FI",
      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "5) Enable network encryption: Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "6) Regularly reboot your router: Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software: To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",

      "Cybercriminals are constantly evolving the ways they target us, which means securing just your phone or laptop isn\u2019t enough anymore. You need to be cautious with anything connected to the internet, whether it's your router, smart cameras or doorbell. However, the Broadband Genie survey reveals that only a small number of people are aware of the best cybersecurity practices when it comes to protecting their routers. As a basic rule, always remember to change default passwords and rename your router\u2019s network to ensure better security.",

      "Sebastian Zapeta, 33, was indicted on one count of murder in the first degree, three counts of murder in the second degree and one count of arson after a woman was lit on fire and burned to death on a subway train in Brooklyn, New York. The indictment was filed Thursday and will be unsealed at an arraignment hearing on Jan. 7.",
      "Zapeta's attorney told the judge he spoke with his client Friday and asked for permission to waive his client's appearance. The judge granted the request.",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News that it has lodged an immigration detainer with the New York City Department of Corrections for Zapeta, but the corrections department has indicated it will not honor the detainer, per its current policy.

      "Gonzalez said at a Friday press briefing that he believes the case should be tried in state court. His remarks come after New York City Mayor Adams' office tells Fox News that the mayor believes Zapeta should face federal criminal charges.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that this case belongs in state court because the charges here are more significant in state court than currently in federal court,\" Gonzalez said. \"But we have a very strong working relationship with our federal partners and we always do what's in the best interests of the people in the state of New York and in the city of Brooklyn (sic) because we want to make sure that he is held fully accountable.\"",
      "Zapeta faces life without the possibility of parole on the murder in the first-degree charge, while second-degree murder carries 25 years to life, Gonzalez said.",
      "\"This was malicious. A sleeping, vulnerable woman on our subway system,\" Gonzalez added. \"This act surprised many New Yorkers as they were getting ready to celebrate the holidays but now New Yorkers are waking up and understanding that on the 22nd of this year, this happened. This was intentional and we hope to prove this.\"",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition parties moved Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly voted Friday to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo despite vehement protests by governing party lawmakers, further deepening the country\u2019s political crisis set off by President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment.",
      "Han\u2019s impeachment means he will be stripped of the powers and duties of the president until the Constitutional Court decides whether to dismiss or reinstate him. The court is already reviewing whether to uphold Yoon's earlier impeachment. The impeachments of the country\u2019s top two officials has worsened its political turmoil, deepened economic uncertainties and hurt its international image.",
      "The single-chamber National Assembly passed Han\u2019s impeachment motion with a 192-0 vote. Lawmakers with the governing People Power Party boycotted the vote and surrounded the podium where assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik was seated, shouting that the vote was \"invalid\" and demanding Woo's resignation. No violence or injuries were reported.",
      "The PPP lawmakers protested after Woo called for a vote on Han\u2019s impeachment motion after announcing its passage required a simple majority in the 300-member assembly, not a two-thirds majority as claimed by the PPP. Most South Korean officials can be impeached by the National Assembly with a simple majority vote, but a president\u2019s impeachment needs the support of two-thirds. There are no specific laws on the impeachment of an acting president.",
      "SOUTH KOREA LAWMAKERS VOTE TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT OVER MARTIAL LAW DECLARATION",
      "The national assembly in South Korea voted to impeach President Han Duck-soo. (Hong Hae-in/Yonhap via AP)",

      "Han\u2019s powers were officially suspended after copies of his impeachment document were delivered to him and the Constitutional Court. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, took over.",

He also told the foreign ministry to inform the U.S., Japan and other major partners that South Korea's foreign policies remain unchanged.",
      "Han, who was appointed prime minister by Yoon, became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the National Assembly about two weeks ago over his short-lived Dec. 3 imposition of martial law. Han quickly clashed with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party as he pushed back against opposition-led efforts to fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, establish an independent investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and legislate pro-farmer bills.",
      "At the heart of the fighting is the Democratic Party\u2019s demand that Han approve the assembly's nominations of three new Constitutional Court justices to restore its full nine-member bench ahead of its ruling on Yoon\u2019s impeachment. That\u2019s a politically sensitive issue because a court decision to dismiss Yoon as president needs support from at least six justices, and adding more justices will likely increase the prospects for Yoon\u2019s ouster. Yoon\u2019s political allies in the governing party oppose the appointment of the three justices, saying Han shouldn\u2019t exercise the presidential authority to make the appointments while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "On Thursday, Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent. Later in the day, the Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the assembly, submitted an impeachment motion against Han and passed bills calling for the appointment of three justices.",
      "South Korean investigative agencies are probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power with his marital law decree. Yoon has repeatedly ignored requests by authorities to appear for face-to-face questioning,",
      "His defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon\u2019s decree.",

The reports said Kim, a close associate of Yoon, became the first person to be formally charged over the martial law decree. Calls to a Seoul prosecutors' office were unanswered.",

Now I hope I\u2019ll never need to use it, but I\u2019m prepared if I have to.\"",

Although military service ensured that many Israelis were trained with weapons, personal firearms were seen as more of a liability than a necessity.

Historically, Israel has avoided the public mass shootings that have sometimes plagued the U.S., but experts warn that the rapid proliferation of firearms could change this. With so many untrained individuals carrying weapons, the fear of impulsive actions and tragic mistakes looms large.",

      "For many Israelis, the reform represents a necessary response to an existential threat. Yet, it has also exposed deep flaws in the system.

      "Froman sees things differently. \"If someone threatens you, you only draw your weapon in a national security situation.

    "summary": "The Jimmy Carter drug introduced the world to cancer immunotherapy, a treatment that differs from chemotherapy. Carter was diagnosed with melanoma in 2015.",
    "story": [
      "Former President Jimmy Carter was known globally for his diplomacy and humanitarian work. The world of medicine will remember him not only as a person who beat the cancer that spread in his body, but also as arguably the most influential voice to raise awareness of a cutting-edge cancer treatment: immunotherapy.",
      "Even people who have never heard that term usually know it was \u201cthe Jimmy Carter drug\u201d that helped save his life.",
      "Carter\u2019s successful cancer treatment \u201cwould have been considered a miracle just 15 to 20 years ago,\u201d said Dr. Adam Friedman, chair of dermatology at George Washington University. \u201cThe \u2018Carter effect\u2019 spawned a new era of hope for patients who would ordinarily be hopeless.\u201d",
      "Advances in melanoma",
      "In 2015, a person with metastatic melanoma \u2014 a form of skin cancer that has spread throughout the body \u2014 was unlikely to survive more than six months, and possibly not even six weeks if he or she happened to be 90 years old.",
      "Carter believed that was his fate when he announced in August of that year that melanoma had spread to his liver and his brain.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful life,\u201d Carter said at a media briefing at the time. \u201cI feel that it\u2019s in the hands of God and my doctors, and I\u2019ll be prepared for anything that comes.\u201d",
      "There are many possible reasons Carter, who died Sunday at age 100, survived as long as he did. He had access to some of the best cancer doctors in the world as he underwent surgery and radiation. He was a man of strong faith and lived with purpose, which he spoke about at the 2015 briefing.",
      "He also revealed that he would be treated with a relatively new immunotherapy called pembrolizumab, sold as Keytruda.",
      "Keytruda works by harnessing the power of the body\u2019s immune system to attack cancer cells.",
      "\u201cThis is a medicine that they use for melanoma that enhances the activity of the immune system,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the first immunotherapy drug, called Yervoy, just four years earlier, in 2011. Keytruda wasn\u2019t greenlighted until 2014. Both were originally intended for the notoriously hard-to-treat melanoma.",
      "Before that, there hadn\u2019t been any new approaches for melanoma in decades, said Dr. Amod Sarnaik, a professor of cutaneous oncology and immunology at Moffitt Cancer Center\u2019s Cutaneous Oncology Program in Tampa, Florida.",
      "\u201cIt was a rather depressing time,\u201d he said.",
      "Carter\u2019s willingness to speak openly about the new approach, Sarnaik said, prompted excitement and investment in the field.",
      "\u201cIn the absence of this unfortunate thing happening to President Carter, I don\u2019t think that we would be talking about immunotherapy in the national domain,\u201d he said.",
      "Since Carter\u2019s diagnosis, at least 15 new treatments for stage 4 melanoma have been approved, said Dr. Michael Davies, chair of the department of melanoma and medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Some immune therapies are used in combination with other cancer drugs or even surgery at earlier stages of disease.",
      "And its use has expanded greatly. Varying forms of immunotherapy are used to treat a wide variety of cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer and some rare forms of colon cancer.",
      "Studies of its possible use in treating pancreatic cancer are also underway, said Dr. Suresh Ramalingam, executive director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, where Carter was treated. Ramalingam wasn\u2019t directly involved in Carter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cImmunotherapy has been a game changer,\u201d Ramalingam said. \u201cWe are seeing patients live longer and live better because of what immunotherapy has meant to the field of cancer.\u201d",
      "In early June, researchers at NYU Langone Health reported that patients with metastatic melanoma given a combination of pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and an experimental mRNA vaccine targeting their cancer cells were living longer without additional spread of their disease compared to people who got Keytruda alone.",
      "Three-quarters of patients who got both therapies had no recurrence three years later, compared to 56% in the Keytruda-only group. The combination group had an edge in survival, too: 96% versus 90%.",
      "Immunotherapy doesn\u2019t work for everyone, offering only about a 30% to 60% success rate, depending on the cancer and the course of treatment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied with that,\u201d Sarnaik said. \u201cWe want a 90% to 100% response rate, and we\u2019re nowhere near those numbers.\u201d",
      "There can be side effects. Immunotherapy can kick the immune system into overdrive, causing a variety of inflammatory responses. People who develop lung inflammation may need supplemental oxygen. Such a complication in the colon, called colitis, can be life-threatening, Davies said.",
      "Still, it doesn\u2019t usually come with hair loss, nausea, extreme fatigue and other side effects historically associated with chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cMany of my patients on immunotherapy continue in their jobs. They get the treatment in the morning and go to work in the afternoon,\u201d Ramalingam said.",
      "Colleagues who treated Carter were \u201cimmensely grateful\u201d for his contribution in raising awareness of immunotherapy, Ramalingam said.",
      "\u201cWhen we see patients like President Carter beat their cancer, that is the positive reinforcement that drives us to do even better,\u201d Ramalingam said."

      "More than 10,200 flights within, into or out of the United States have been delayed, and nearly 500 were canceled as of Sunday evening, according to FlightAware.com.",
      "The unusual weather weekend, which more often takes place when spring and fall bookend summer, is partly the result of cold air clashing with rare December warmth.",
      "High temperatures in parts of Texas could break the 90-degree mark early in the week, the weather service said. The Southeast could get high temperatures in the 70s, even as cool air is drawn behind that tornado-sparking front, federal forecasters said."

      "The airport is about 180 miles south of Seoul.",
      "The Boeing 737-800 plane took off from Bangkok shortly after 2 a.m. local time (2 p.m. Saturday ET), according to the flight-tracking platform FlightAware. It was carrying 175 passengers and six crew members, said Joo Jong-wan, director of the Aviation Policy Division at South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.",
      "At least two of the passengers were Thai, Joo said. Most of the rest are believed to be Korean.",
      "\u201cThe pilot declared mayday after issuing the bird strike alert,\u201d Joo said, adding that the aircraft was \u201ccompletely destroyed.\u201d",
      "The plane skidded along the runway and exploded as it rammed into a barrier, a video verified by NBC News showed. The tail was the only part that appeared to remain intact as flames engulfed the aircraft, sending a plume of black smoke into the air.",
      "Deadliest airline disaster of the year",
      "The national fire agency confirmed the deaths of 179 people, making it the deadliest airline disaster of the year and what appears to be the first fatal accident since the low-cost airline was founded in 2005.",
      "The agency said it had determined the identities of at least 88 of the victims. As the confirmed death toll ticked up, anxious families gathered at the airport, awaiting news of their loved ones. An announcer carefully read out the names of those confirmed dead.",
      "Screams and cries erupted from family members as the identities were confirmed according to reports by the South Korean news agency Newsis. The Red Cross set up tents to provide privacy for grieving family members.",
      "At least 84 of the dead were women and 82 were men. The genders of 11 other victims were not immediately identifiable.",
      "Two crew members \u2014 a man and a woman \u2014 were rescued; they sustained moderate injuries but were conscious, Joo said.",
      "South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that one of them, a 33-year-old flight attendant identified with his surname, Lee, sustained multiple injuries, including fractured ribs and traumatic spinal injuries, according to Ju Woong, director of Ewha Woman's University Seoul Hospital, where Lee was transferred.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up, I had already been rescued,\u201d\u00a0Ju said Lee told the doctors, adding that he was in intensive care but was able to communicate well. \"There\u2019s no indication yet of memory loss or such,\u201d Ju said.",

      "A bird strike likely set off the disaster",
      "Joo, the aviation official, gave an outline of the sequence of events leading to the disaster.",
      "The pilots initially tried to land on the airport\u2019s Runway 1, he said, but control tower instructed them to land on the opposite side, Runway 19, because of a bird strike warning. A bird strike is a collision between a bird and an aircraft.",
      "A minute later, the pilots sent a mayday signal following a bird strike and tried to land on Runway 19.",
      "As it was passing over the runway, the plane failed to lower its landing gear and struck a safety system called a localizer \u2014 which provides guidance during landing \u2014 and it crashed into a wall, Joo said.",
      "The crash happened at around 9:03 a.m. local time (7:03 p.m. ET Saturday), and firefighters put out the initial blaze at 9:46 a.m. local time, the fire agency spokesperson said.",
      "The plane was \u201ccompletely destroyed by fire,\u201d Joo said at a briefing, adding investigators have retrieved both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which will be key to providing insights into the plane\u2019s last moments.",
      "The full investigation, he said, could take six months to three years.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board is leading an American team, including Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, that will assist South Korea in investigating.",

      "\"As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by this tragedy,\" he said.",
      "Eyewitness Lee Geun-Young was in his restaurant, less than a quarter-mile from the airport, when he heard loud banging noises coming from outside, he told the South Korean newspaper Seoul Shinmun.",
      "\u201cInstead of heading toward the runway, the plane flew right over our store,\u201d Lee, 49, said as he described the last moments of the ill-fated aircraft. Lee said he watched the plane as it turned around to attempt a landing on the runway.",
      "\u201cThis plane was turning in a much tighter radius,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt dangerous, so I immediately went up to the rooftop and started filming.\u201d",
      "The plane, a Boeing 737-800, is a narrow-body passenger jet that is used widely by airlines around the world. It is part of the Boeing's Next-Generation family, and it is one of the company's safest airplanes.",

      "Joo said more than 1,500 personnel from multiple agencies were conducting search-and-recovery efforts. The dead were temporarily being kept at a makeshift mortuary set up at the airport, Joo said.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Many body positivity advocates worry 2024 marked a return to \u201cthinness\u201d as the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Celebrity stylist Ariel Tunnell typically pulls clothing options from the runway for her clients of all sizes.",
      "But this past year, she\u2019s noticed an alarming trend in the fashion industry. While there are designer options out there for bigger bodies, the choices have become few and far between.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all aware that we are taking a step backwards,\u201d said Tunnell, who has styled stars including singer Camila Cabello and actor Rachel Bloom. \u201cThere was a bigger push for inclusivity and body acceptance of all shapes and sizes that feels like it is trending backwards.\u201d",
      "Tunnell\u2019s concerns echo those of body positivity advocates, who have spent years advocating for self-acceptance regardless of body type. Now, many worry 2024 marked a return to \u201cthinness\u201d as the norm.",
      "Influencers who are known for championing body positivity began sounding the alarm earlier this year, saying it feels like the way people talk and think about people\u2019s bodies has reverted back to an obsession with one specific size.",
      "More recently, some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars have commented on unfair beauty standards. This month, actor Sydney Sweeney clapped back at online trolls who described her as fat in paparazzi images of her relaxing in the Florida Keys. Actor Florence Pugh also addressed public commentary on her body, telling The Sunday Times in a recent interview that there are people who are \u201cstill angry with me for not losing more weight.\u201d",
      "In its spring/summer 2025 size inclusivity report, Vogue Business wrote that \u201cprogress has stalled and we are facing a worrying return to using extremely thin models, amid the Ozempic boom,\u201d referring to the popularity of the semaglutide drug used for weight loss.",
      "The fashion publication said it analyzed \u201cevery runway show and presentation featured on Vogue Runway from the official New York, London, Milan and Paris schedules to calculate the proportion of total looks that are straight, mid and plus-size.\u201d The publication found that less than 1% of the more than 8,700 runway models were plus size. Meanwhile, more than 94% were between a U.S. Size 0 and 4.",
      "Even some brands\u2019 attempts to be more inclusive were seen as falling short. Victoria\u2019s Secret, a lingerie brand that once faced criticism for its lack of inclusivity, included plus-size models like Ashley Graham in its revamped Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show in October. The brand said it would move \u201cfrom promoting an exclusionary view of what\u2019s sexy, to celebrating all women throughout every phase of their lives.\u201d However, some said they felt the show still mostly included skinny models and \u201cmissed the mark.\u201d",
      "In recent years, the world of plastic surgery has also appeared to move away from the Kardashian-esque to more streamlined frames. A study released in June by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found increased interest in what it described as the \u201cballet body,\u201d or a body that appears both natural and athletic, and is accomplished through several procedures including liposuction, breast augmentation and filler.",
      "Some who have studied the body positivity movement said they believe it has never actually gotten much traction.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cno evidence that we\u2019re seeing less anti-fat bias\u201d or \u201cless shaming of women for their body size,\u201d said Renee Engeln, a psychology professor at Northwestern University.",
      "\u201cCertainly, in recent decades, I don\u2019t think we have seen meaningful change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to remember that there\u2019s a difference between seeing messages around body positivity and body neutrality or anything like that, and actually feeling OK about your body.\u201d",
      "Many people, women in particular, have continued to face unfair beauty standards as their bodies are scrutinized. For example, during the \u201cWicked\u201d press tour, online commenters discussed the weight of stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, whom they criticized as being \u201ctoo skinny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been kind of doing this in front of the public and kind of been, you know, a specimen in a petri dish, really, since I was 16 or 17,\u201d Grande said in a recent interview with French journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga. \u201cI\u2019ve heard every version of it, of what\u2019s wrong with me, and then you fix it, and then it\u2019s wrong for different reasons.\u201d",
      "Many attempts to change people\u2019s thinking about their own bodies are individualistic and don\u2019t try to tackle systemic issues at the root of why thinness is often praised, according to Engeln.",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with the way you\u2019re thinking about your body. You need more confidence. You need to accept it,\u2019\u201d Engeln said of body positive messaging. \u201cAnd that would be great if those things happened, but that does nothing to change a broader culture that is just steeped in toxic attitudes about women\u2019s bodies.\u201d",
      "Tunnell, the stylist, echoed Engeln\u2019s belief that societal change requires a widespread effort.",
      "\u201cIf no one fights and no one continues to speak up, I think thin will always be in, and thin will always win,\u201d Tunnell said. \u201cBecause that is unfortunately ingrained in our society, and unless we are always kind of bucking that norm, it\u2019s not going to be broken.\u201d"

    "summary": "Diversity, equity and inclusion programs at some of the country\u2019s biggest companies fell apart in 2024. Anti-DEI efforts will most likely only ramp up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "One by one, diversity, equity and inclusion programs at some of the country\u2019s biggest companies fell apart in 2024, with signs that efforts to reverse DEI initiatives will only ramp up in 2025.",
      "This year saw the rise in prominent figures like Elon Musk and Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, among others, who vocally pushed against DEI initiatives. Major companies, including Walmart, Lowe\u2019s, Ford and Toyota, heeded the calls and dialed back their DEI programs, particularly after social media-driven campaigns by influencers like Robby Starbuck.",
      "Meanwhile Utah, Alabama and Iowa joined Florida and Texas by banning DEI offices in their public universities, and three more states \u2014 Idaho, Kansas and Indiana \u2014 barred colleges from requiring diversity statements in hiring and admissions.",
      "All that came after countless companies pledged sweeping support for diversity efforts after George Floyd\u2019s murder by police in Minneapolis in 2020 initiated a national social justice movement.",
      "But with President-elect Donald Trump and his administration vowing to wipe out federally funded diversity programs, the future of DEI is precarious.",
      "Nika White, whose company specializes in DEI, said the field has had a challenging year.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric around banning DEI programs in corporate and academic settings, especially in the context of the broader political climate, often ignores the reality that such programs are designed not to \u2018lower standards\u2019 but to raise them by ensuring that everyone \u2014 regardless of background \u2014 has an equal opportunity to contribute and succeed,\u201d she said.",
      "Opponents of DEI see those initiatives in a drastically different way. Musk said on his social media platform, X, \u201cDEI is just another word for racism.\u201d As a senator, Vice President-elect JD Vance co-introduced the Dismantle DEI Act in June, saying DEI \u201cis a destructive ideology that breeds hatred and racial division.\u201d Trump signed an executive order barring federal DEI programs near the end of his first term in 2020, which Joe Biden revoked shortly after he took office. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In the heat of the presidential election this summer, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was called a \u201cDEI hire\u201d in one of the more extreme strikes at the policies. A politician baselessly blamed the Baltimore bridge collapse on DEI in March, and others claimed DEI makes air travel unsafe.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are often rooted in anti-Black racism,\u201d White said. \u201cBillionaire business owners wielding influence to curtail DEI initiatives often do so under the guise of \u2018colorblindness\u2019 or \u2018meritocracy,\u2019 arguing that DEI programs prioritize identity over skill. They undermine the progress made over the past few decades, creating a chilling effect that could further polarize our society, limiting the ability of organizations to have open, honest conversations about race, equity and inclusion \u2014 conversations that are critical in moving us forward as a nation.\u201d",
      "She added that demonizing DEI \u201cfails to recognize the systemic barriers that many marginalized groups face in accessing opportunities and thriving in environments where they are not valued or represented.\u201d",
      "Not quite a death knell",
      "If 2025 will be the year DEI dies, as some hope, it seems it will take a herculean effort. Trump has threatened to rescind federal funding and accreditation of universities and colleges that do not comply, which would face legal challenges.",
      "On the business side, plenty of companies have continued diversity and inclusion initiatives, even if quietly. CEOs like JPMorgan Chase Bank\u2019s Jamie Dimon called himself a \u201cfull-throated, red-blooded, patriotic, \u2018unwoke,\u2019 capitalist CEO\u201d whose commitment to DEI has not wavered. Mark Cuban, the \u201cShark Tank\u201d host and former owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks, said having a diverse workforce is \u201cgood for business.\u201d",
      "Fatimah Gilliam, who heads the DEI consulting firm The Azara Group and is the author of \u201cRace Rules: What Your Black Friends Won\u2019t Tell You,\u201d wants to hear more voices like those in the new year to stave off the threats. She said the capitulation of companies and universities and the silence from business leaders have been \u201cdisheartening,\u201d or what she calls \u201cprofiles in no courage.\u201d",
      "Gilliam added that the longer negative rhetoric about DEI goes unchallenged, \u201cpeople sort of justify this new normal; they\u2019re not just going along with it, but then they start to defend it.\u201d",
      "A survey by College Rover, a website that allows users to manage the intricacies of applying to college, said that 54% of student respondents support DEI and push for mandatory DEI courses and that 70% describe the overall impact of DEI as positive on college campuses.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d said Bill Townsend, CEO and founder of College Rover. \u201cIs DEI flawed? Yes, but it\u2019s still working. But there are many good parts that are being thrown out with the bad, and the students see that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWorking\u201d for Townsend includes the socialization and exposure to varying opinions and experiences that come with a diverse student body. In fact, he said, 55% of Republican students surveyed said they viewed DEI as positive.",
      "\u201cAnd the big positive about DEI is that it exposes people to ethnic groups and viewpoints about ethnicities that are different from how they were raised at home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to work and live among people who are different from us. DEI helps us manage that dynamic. Getting rid of DEI reinforces the fact that you don\u2019t have to get along with everybody. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d",
      "In addition, according to Boston Consulting Group, research of more than 27,000 employees in 16 countries shows that DEI programs increase profits and inspire employee commitment. White said, \u201cMany leaders are doubling down on their commitments to DEI, not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do but because they understand that inclusivity drives innovation, employee satisfaction and organizational performance.\u201d",
      "In 2024, DEI detractor Robby Starbuck led a push for companies, including mammoth Walmart, to disband their DEI programs through fiery social media posts.",
      "Starbuck, who did not respond to a request for comment about his plans for 2025, has said \u201cI do have a list of targets\u201d he will pressure to drop DEI.",
      "White and Gilliam, the DEI experts, acknowledged Starbuck\u2019s influence. As a result, some companies that want to keep DEI but are fearful of the backlash have rebranded diversity, equity and inclusion as \u201cinclusion and belonging\u201d and other phrases.",
      "\u201cDEI, the letters and what they mean, are a problem for people,\u201d Townsend said, adding that \u201cdiversity and inclusivity\u201d may be less confrontational.",
      "Proponents of DEI said they do not care what it is called. They just want it protected.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pessimistic about the future of DEI because I see things as they are happening,\u201d Gilliam said. \u201cBut I do think there\u2019s hope, but the hope has to come from people on an individual basis. People need to stand up and make a decision to impact what\u2019s actually taking place. \u2018You won\u2019t stand up and support me, I won\u2019t support you by spending my dollars with your company. And I\u2019m going to tell everyone else not to as well.\u2019 We have to put a stake in the ground and take a stand that\u2019s just as aggressive as theirs. It\u2019s that important.\u201d"

      "Prior to Kotov\u2019s death, independent media outlet Mediazona reported earlier this month that Kotov had rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn\u2019t resist.",
      "Just over a year ago, Russia\u2019s Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ activism in a ruling that designated \u201cthe international LGBT movement\u201d as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.",
      "The LGBTQ community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its \u201ctraditional family values\u201d by pushing for LGBTQ rights."

      "TBILISI, Georgia\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Mikheil Kavelashvili, a hardline critic of the West, was sworn in as president of\u00a0Georgia\u00a0on Sunday amid a political crisis after the government froze European Union application talks in a move that sparked major protests.",
      "Outgoing President\u00a0Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU\u00a0opponent of\u00a0the ruling party, said in a defiant speech to supporters outside the presidential palace that she was leaving the residence, but that Kavelashvili had no legitimacy as president, which is a mostly ceremonial position.",
      "She said: \u201cI will come out of here and be with you\u201d.",
      "\u201cI am taking legitimacy with me, I am taking the flag with me, I am taking your trust with me,\u201d she added, before walking out of the palace to mingle with her supporters.",
      "Zourabichvili says that Kavelashvili was not duly picked, as the lawmakers who chose him were elected in an October parliamentary election that she says was marked by fraud.\u00a0Georgia\u2019s opposition parties support her.",
      "The\u00a0Georgian Dream ruling party and the country\u2019s election commission say that the October election was free and fair. The ruling party says Kavelashvili is the duly elected president.",
      "The presidential standoff is seen as a watershed moment in\u00a0Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million that had until recently been regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states.",
      "Kavelashvili is a loyalist of\u00a0Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire ex-prime minister who is widely seen as\u00a0Georgia\u2019s de facto leader.",
      "On Friday, the U.S.\u00a0imposed sanctions\u00a0on Ivanishvili, saying he was spearheading\u00a0Georgia\u2019s current anti-Western and pro-Russian turn.",
      "Protesters hold up red cards",
      "Kavelashvili, a former professional soccer player who briefly played as a striker for Manchester City, has repeatedly\u00a0accused\u00a0Western intelligence agencies of plotting to drive\u00a0Georgia\u00a0into war with neighboring Russia.",
      "\u201cThe\u00a0Georgian people have always understood that peace is the main prerequisite for survival and development,\u201d he said after being sworn in on Sunday.",
      "Protesters outside parliament held up red cards in a mocking reference to Kavelashvili\u2019s athletic career.",
      "Georgian Dream got almost 54% of the official vote in October\u2019s election.",
      "Local and international election monitors have said the vote was marked by violations that could have affected the results. Western countries have called for an investigation.",
      "Zourabichvili is backed by the country\u2019s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate president until fresh elections are held.",
      "The confrontation comes amid a month of\u00a0protests\u00a0sparked by\u00a0Georgian Dream\u2019s suspension of EU accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a longstanding national goal of joining the bloc that is written into the country\u2019s constitution.",
      "The move touched off widespread anger among\u00a0Georgians, who polls show are firmly pro-EU, and prompted a police\u00a0crackdown, with over 400 people, including senior opposition leaders, detained.",
      "Zourabichvili has accused\u00a0Georgian Dream of deliberately sinking\u00a0Georgia\u2019s EU hopes and instead moving towards Russia, from which\u00a0Georgia\u00a0gained independence in 1991.",
      "Opposition supporters say that under Zourabichvili, who was elected with\u00a0Georgian Dream\u2019s support in 2018 before breaking with the party in recent years, the presidency was the only institution in the country not ultimately under the control of ruling party founder Ivanishvili.",
      "They say that with the installation of Kavelashvili, Ivanishvili will have total control over\u00a0Georgia."

      "Matthew Goldstein, 52, was an elementary school teacher in Chestnut Hill and his wife Lyla Goldstein, 54, was a project manager at Microsoft. Their daughters, Valerie, 22, who was also a teacher, and Violet, 19, a college student, also died in the accident. The family lived in Newton, Massachusetts, and were visiting New Hampshire over the Christmas holidays.",
      "Investigators said they haven\u2019t yet figured out what caused the apparent leak of carbon monoxide from the propane gas heating system.",
      "New Hampshire Fire Marshal Sean Toomey said there were no carbon monoxide alarms found in the home, and he urged people to install and maintain such alarms.",
      "\u201cThis has been a terribly tragic year for both fire deaths and carbon monoxide deaths,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cTo lose a whole family of four right in the peak of the holiday season hits home even more.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes carbon monoxide as a colorless, odorless gas that can kill without warning. The CDC said more than 400 Americans die each year from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires, while another 14,000 are hospitalized.",
      "Police arrived at the house in the town of Wakefield about 4:20 p.m. on Christmas Day after the family didn\u2019t show up as expected at an extended family gathering. Other relatives had tried messaging and calling each of the four, Toomey said. Those relatives then called police, who conducted a welfare check, he said.",
      "Toomey said police found three of the victims in bedrooms and the fourth in a bathroom, and that authorities suspect they died during the night. When fire crews arrived, they found the home had elevated levels of carbon monoxide, Toomey said, adding that the deaths were believed to be accidental.",
      "New Hampshire\u2019s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner completed an autopsy of Matthew Goldstein and found his cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Autopsies have yet to be completed on the other three victims.",
      "Matthew Goldstein taught eighth grade at the Edith C. Baker School near Boston, which serves the Chestnut Hill and South Brookline neighborhoods of Brookline.",
      "\u201cMr. Goldstein\u2019s dedication to inspiring students and shaping young minds has left an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of knowing him. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, colleagues and students during this profoundly difficult time,\u201d Brookline Public Schools Superintendent Linus Guillory said in a statement.",
      "Matthew Goldstein had also performed in many plays for the Newton Theatre Company.",
      "Lyla Goldstein\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicated she had worked at Microsoft for more than 16 years and for the last four years had been a principal project manager, focusing on projects that involved data and artificial intelligence.",
      "Valerie Goldstein\u2019s LinkedIn profile said she was working as a fifth grade teacher in eastern North Carolina, in the first year of a Teach for America commitment after graduating from Syracuse University. She said in her profile that she hoped for a future career in education policy and advocacy.",
      "Violet Goldstein was a freshman at the Rhode Island School of Design, school President Crystal Williams said.",
      "\u201cI know that you join me in feeling utter heartbreak at the loss of such a promising young member of our community, along with her family, on what should have been a joyous occasion,\u201d Williams wrote in an email to the school\u2019s community.",
      "Tax records indicate the home, on the northern tip of Balch Lake, was owned by the couple. A listing on Redfin says the home, which includes a pool and a dock, was newly renovated and had a new, efficient heating system.",
      "Temperatures in Wakefield on Christmas Day reached a low of about 13 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius).",
      "Toomey said investigators believe the heating system in the home malfunctioned, allowing carbon monoxide to escape outside of the normal venting system. He said leaks can happen whenever there isn\u2019t efficient combustion in propane, oil or wood heating systems.",
      "As well as having alarms, he said, people should ensure their chimneys are routinely cleaned and their systems serviced. They should also check during winter that vents aren\u2019t blocked by snow or ice, he said."

    "story": [
      "From legal cases to attempted assassinations, 2024 proved to be a roller coaster in U.S. politics. Former President Donald Trump became president-elect, setting up a historic return to the White House in January. He faced many ups and downs throughout the year.",
      "For the current president, Joe Biden, this year was also full of ups and downs, as he started the year as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president but ultimately ended his political career in an unanticipated fashion.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the news stories that shaped American politics this year, month by month.",
      "January",
      "On Jan. 26, a jury in New York found Trump liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, ordering him to pay her a total of $83.3 million in damages. The award includes $11 million for damage to her reputation, $7.3 million for emotional harm and other damages, and $65 million for punitive damages.",
      "During closing arguments, Trump stormed out of the courtroom before the jury reached its verdict. He was already found liable in September 2023 for defaming Carroll while he was president for mocking her claim that he had sexually abused her. Trump also testified at the trial for just under five minutes, during which he clashed with the judge and called Carroll\u2019s accusations false.",
      "In the first big step toward Trump gaining the Republican presidential nomination, Trump won the Iowa caucuses. He defeated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley by a wide margin, winning 51% of the vote. Just after the Iowa caucuses, Trump won the New Hampshire primary with 54.4% of the vote against Haley. DeSantis withdrew from the race on Jan. 21.",
      "February",
      "Special counsel Robert Hur declined to prosecute Biden for his handling of classified documents, but said in a report that Biden\u2019s actions \u201cpresent serious risks to national security.\u201d Another part of the puzzle, Hur said, is that Biden could have used the defense of poor memory, which would be sympathetic to a jury.",
      "The saga about classified documents and Biden began in 2022, when Biden\u2019s personal attorneys found classified documents appearing from the Obama administration at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, which Biden used as a personal office. Classified documents were also found in Biden\u2019s Wilmington, Delaware, home.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced in February that he was stepping down from his position leading Republicans in the Senate. McConnell, who has held the post since 2007, announced his departure in a speech on the Senate floor. In his speech, he said, \u201cOne of life\u2019s most underappreciated talents is to know when it\u2019s time to move on to life\u2019s next chapter.\u201d",
      "McConnell will be replaced in January 2025 by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who was chosen as the new Senate majority leader during elections in November. Though he is stepping down from a leadership position, McConnell will remain in the Senate until at least January 2027.",
      "March",
      "The Supreme Court handed a sweeping win to Trump in March when it ruled unanimously that states can\u2019t remove him from the ballot over his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The court reversed the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, which found that Trump could not serve again as president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.",
      "The amendment prohibits those who previously held government positions but later \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d from running for various offices. However, the Supreme Court determined that the Colorado Supreme Court wrongly assumed that states can determine whether a candidate is eligible to run for office.",
      "On March 12, Trump secured enough delegates to become the official Republican nominee for president. This sealed a rematch of the 2020 election, with Trump again to face Biden.",
      "Trump went into the primaries in Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington as the presumptive nominee, with Haley having dropped out of the race after winning only one state on Super Tuesday. Trump\u2019s victories in these states pushed him over the 1,215-delegate mark needed for a majority.",
      "April",
      "In a historic move, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a 160-year-old near-total abortion ban was enforceable. The ruling allowed an 1864 law in Arizona to stand, which would have made abortion a felony punishable by two to five years in prison for anyone who performs one or helps a woman obtain one. The law, which was changed in 1901, bans abortion from the moment of conception but includes an exception to save the woman\u2019s life.",
      "This ruling caused a backlash in the state, as it essentially undid a lower court\u2019s ruling that held that a more recent 15-week ban from March 2022 superseded the 1864 law. The Arizona Supreme Court then put the decision on hold for 14 days after backlash from Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue.",
      "At the end of April, the Supreme Court heard Trump\u2019s presidential immunity case, with arguments centering on whether a former president can be prosecuted for \u201cofficial acts taken in office.\u201d",
      "In July, it ruled that Trump has some immunity for some of his alleged conduct as president in his federal election interference case. The justices voted 6-3 to reject Trump\u2019s broad claim of immunity, meaning the charges related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results would not be dismissed.",
      "May",
      "After the controversial Arizona Supreme Court ruling in April, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban. She signed it inside the state Capitol just one day after the state Senate passed it.",
      "However, the journey to signing the repeal was no easy feat. A week before it got to the governor, the state House passed the repeal on its third attempt in three weeks. Months later, Arizonans also voted for Proposition 139, which establishes a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution.",
      "Trump made history in many ways this year, including by becoming the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. At the end of May, a New York jury found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",
      "The jury reached its verdict after 9 \u00bd hours of deliberations. Trump had pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records related to a hush money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Trump was originally set to be sentenced in July of this year, but as of late December, sentencing was still pending and the judge had denied the president-elect\u2019s bid to vacate his guilty verdict on presidential immunity grounds.",
      "June",
      "At the beginning of June, a jury found Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, guilty of three felony gun charges after a weeklong trial focusing on his history of addiction. Biden was charged in federal court in Wilmington with three felony counts tied to possession of a gun while using narcotics. He pleaded not guilty.",
      "The trial was the first involving the child of a sitting president. If he were to have been sentenced, he could have faced prison time. Two of the counts carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, while the third carries a maximum of five years.",
      "In what would become a pivotal moment in Biden\u2019s political career, Biden and Trump faced off in their first presidential debate. During the debate, Trump provided no new answers for voters on crucial issues, including his felony conviction, his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, and his actions on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Throughout the 90 minutes, Biden struggled through answers and failed to deliver an energetic performance. As the debate began, Biden\u2019s voice was hoarse, his throat didn\u2019t sound clear, and he spoke softly while struggling through some of his responses. His performance ultimately led 37 congressional Democrats to call on him to drop out of the race.",
      "July",
      "On July 13, Trump was speaking onstage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when shots rang out about six minutes into his remarks. A bullet hit his ear, resulting in him being rushed offstage and taken to the hospital.",
      "One spectator, Corey Comperatore, died as a result of the gunshots. Two other spectators were also injured. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed by the Secret Service at the scene of the incident after shooting from a rooftop nearby. Crooks\u2019 motive in the shooting was believed to be political ideology.",
      "Five days after Trump was shot, he delivered an address at the Republican National Convention with a bandage on his ear. \u201cAs you already know, the assassin\u2019s bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life,\u201d Trump said, thanking his supporters.",
      "As a result of the incident, U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing, which ultimately led various lawmakers to call on her to resign. She\u00a0resigned on July 23.",
      "After a busy 25 days of political news, Biden shook up the state of the presidential race by withdrawing his name from the Democratic Party ticket. Weeks before his announcement, Biden had insisted that he was sticking in the race. But ultimately, according to a source with direct knowledge, he told his staff he had changed his mind.",
      "He made the announcement on X, writing, \u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d",
      "Biden then endorsed Harris to be his replacement in the race, which led her to become the new presumptive Democratic nominee. She then began campaigning to earn the Democratic Party\u2019s official nomination and gain support from people in the party.",
      "August",
      "On Aug. 23, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his independent run for president and endorsed Trump in a speech in Arizona. His campaign first confirmed the news in a court filing in Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2023, Kennedy ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination and instead chose to run as an independent. He used his withdrawal speech this year to criticize Harris and the Democratic Party, saying they were \u201cabandon[ing] democracy.\u201d",
      "In a speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris made history as she accepted the Democratic nomination for president. Standing onstage as the first woman elected vice president of the United States, Harris became the first Black and South Asian woman to be named a major-party presidential nominee.",
      "After only being on the trail for a month, Harris picked her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and raised nearly $500 million by the time she accepted the nomination. In her speech, she shared her biography and her priorities if she were to win.",
      "September",
      "In what would be their only debate of the presidential campaign, Harris and Trump faced off on issues including abortion and lowering consumer costs. Notably, Trump dodged on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban after his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Trump would veto it. As for Harris, she leaned in on lowering costs, highlighting her plan for what she called an \u201copportunity economy.\u201d",
      "Also at the debate, Trump spun rumors that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re eating the dogs, they\u2019re eating the cats.\u201d However, there was no evidence to indicate that such actions were happening. Vance also advanced the claims, writing before the debate that people had contacted his office saying this was happening.",
      "On a Sunday afternoon in West Palm Beach, Florida, shots were fired at Trump\u2019s golf course, leading to what the FBI would deem an apparent \u201cattempted assassination.\u201d Shortly before 2 p.m., Trump was playing a round of golf near his home when a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle with a scope in the bushes outside the course.",
      "The Secret Service then opened fire on the man, who escaped and was eventually arrested. Ryan Wesley Routh was then identified as the suspect and indicted by the Department of Justice on charges including attempted assassination.",
      "October",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter made history this year by becoming the first former U.S. president to turn 100. Carter, who served one term in the White House, hit the milestone while at his home in Plains, Georgia. After turning 100, Carter voted by mail for Harris, which his family said was his goal.",
      "At the beginning of the month, Vance and Walz faced off in a vice presidential debate, tackling issues like immigration and school shootings. Both candidates used the platform to attack the other\u2019s party and serve as a voice for their respective running mates.",
      "During the debate, both addressed their separate controversies. Walz admitted to misspeaking on whether he had visited Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. As for Vance, he defended himself on his past criticism of Trump, in which he said in 2017 that Trump could become \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler.\u201d",
      "November",
      "Trump secured the votes to become the 47th president, with 312 Electoral College votes to Harris\u2019 226. He also won every battleground state. In 2020, the only battleground state he won was North Carolina.",
      "NBC News projected Trump\u2019s win early Wednesday morning, the day after Election Day. After she knew she lost, Harris called Trump to concede the race and addressed supporters at Howard University, emphasizing a peaceful transfer of power.",
      "Trump became the first former president to lose his job and then win it back since Grover Cleveland in 1892. He also saw a huge jump in Latino support, with a 25-point swing in his favor compared to four years ago.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith filed motions to drop all federal charges against Trump over allegations he mishandled classified documents, as well as those involving Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted the motion hours later.",
      "Trump was first indicted in June 2023 in a Miami federal court on 37 felony counts alleging he mishandled classified documents. Separately, he was indicted in August 2023 over his attempt to reverse the 2020 election results.",
      "December",
      "In an unexpected shift, Biden pardoned his son Hunter, saying that \u201craw politics\u201d impacted Hunter\u2019s conviction. The president made his decision just 10 days before Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced on his federal gun charge conviction. On Dec. 16, Hunter Biden was also set to be sentenced in a different case, in which he pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion charges.",
      "These two sentencing dates went away under the president\u2019s \u201cfull and unconditional pardon,\u201d which covers any crimes that may have been committed from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024. In previous statements, Biden insisted that he would let the justice system do its work and that he would not consider a pardon for his son. After Hunter Biden was found guilty in June, Biden said, \u201cI will not pardon him.\u201d",
      "In the largest single day of clemency to date, Biden commuted the sentences of about 1,500 nonviolent offenders. He also pardoned about 39 people on the same day. Many of the offenders who were pardoned or whose sentences were commuted have ties to illegal drugs, and some were released from prison under the CARES Act to prevent overcrowding in federal prisons.",
      "Many of those who received pardons had long ago completed their sentences, but the crimes will now be wiped from their records. The 39 pardoned people include a decorated military veteran who volunteers at a church, a nurse who leads responses to natural disasters and an addiction counselor who works with young people.",
      "In the announcement, the White House also said Biden was the first president to issue \u201ccategorical pardons\u201d for people convicted of the use and possession of marijuana, and for LGBTQ former service members convicted because of their sexual orientation.",
      "Carter, who celebrated his 100th birthday on Oct. 1, died Sunday afternoon. He had been receiving hospice care at his home since February 2023. Carter lived nearly six years longer than the next oldest former president, George H.W. Bush, who died at 94."

      "But how much money is really at stake?",
      "How much is $45.6 billion won in USD?",
      "In the show, $45.6 billion won is the prize if, like in Season 1, it comes down to a sole winner.",

      "Netflix's hit show \"Squid Game\" released its highly anticipated second season on Dec. 26, which consisted of seven episodes.",
      "The second season flashes forward a few years after Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), a.k.a. Player 456, won the games. The trauma of everyone's death from Season 1 still weighs heavily on Gi-hun's conscience, causing him to devote himself and the $45.6 billion won (about $31 million dollars) he won to finding and ending the games once and for all.",
      "However, Gi-hun's plans go astray, causing him to be thrown back into the games once more with an entire new set of players.",
      "This time, the twist is that the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) who orchestrated all the games during Season 1 decided to enter the games himself, posing as Young-il, Player 001. The Front Man, whose real name is In-Ho, is a former winner of the games.",
      "Gi-hun, who once again plays as Player 456, makes his way through the games, beginning (like Season 1) with Red Light, Green Light, but adding in two new games afterwards: Pentathlon and Mingle.",
      "This season adds the twist that after each round, all players vote to decide if they want to continue the games or end them there.",
      "As the season progresses, Young-il (the Front Man in disguise) befriends Gi-hun, gaining his trust by explaining his own tragic backstory. He says his pregnant wife is dying and he joined the games to get the money to save her and his unborn child. However, viewers know the Front Man's wife already has died.",
      "This duo forms an alliance with other characters, including Gi-hun's best friend from Season 1 Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan) who is also a competitor this season and ex-marine Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul).",
      "Season 2 also introduces new players like mother and son duo Park Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Jang Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), crypto currency influencer Lee Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan), pregnant player Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri) and rapper Thanos (Choi Seung-hyun), amongst others.",
      "Outside of the games, Detective Hwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun), who Front Man seemingly shot and killed in the Season 1 finale, is actually alive. He's recovered and now independently searching for the island with the help of the boat captain who rescued him as the police don't believe his story about the games being real.",
      "How does the season end and where is the third, and what seems to be the final, season headed?",
      "Season 2's ending explained",
      "As Gi-hun fights within the games to end them and keep as many people alive as possible, Jun-ho searches for the island with the help of allies Gi-hun enlisted before entering the games a second time.",
      "However, the captain of the boat who has been assisting Jun-ho in finding the island is revealed to be secretly tampering with their search.",
      "By the end of the season, Jun-ho has no luck finding the island and has yet to realize that the boat's captain is actually working to keep the games hidden.",
      "Within the games, the finale begins in the middle of a bloody fight between players. At this point, voting has split the remaining 100 players in half, with half wanting to stay and keep playing the games and half wanting to end the games. With a second vote scheduled for the next day, participants have resorted to killing other players who don't agree with their vote to strengthen their chances of the vote going their way.",
      "Gi-hun, meanwhile, has devised a plan to infiltrate the masked spectators' headquarters to put a stop to the games altogether and, in his words, \"make them pay.\"",
      "His convinces his friends to hide during the chaos instead of fighting to defend others on their side \u2014 which, as Young-il makes him say, shows he's willing to \"sacrifice a few for the good of the rest.\"",
      "While this is a new side to Gi-hun's character, whose goal has been to shed as little blood as possible, he decides a few more lives lost is worth it to end the games once and for all.",
      "When the guards come in to break up the fight, Gi-hun and his friends, who were playing dead, jump the guards and grab their guns, killing all but one in the process.",
      "Gi-hun instructs the surviving guard to bring them to his captain. The rebel crew shoot out the cameras before continuing on through the island fortress.",
      "The Front Man, still pretending to be the friendly Young-il, joins the riot and follows Gi-hun.",
      "The group is intercepted by gun fire before they can reach the game makers. Most of the final episode includes Gi-hun and his rebels fighting back against the pink-suited workers.",
      "Sadly, the rebellion fails, despite some moments of bravery from Hyun-ju who reveals she was in Special Forces before joining the games. They have too little ammo and end up being outnumbered.",
      "While Gi-hun and Jung-bae make it further than most of their crew, they ultimately end up failing when Young-il turns on them.",
      "Young-il splits up from Gi-hun, claiming he saw another way up to where the masked men are shooting down as Gi-hun and Jung-bae. However, when he goes that way, he ends up killing the two players he brought with him and sends a final radio message to Gi-hun pretending that he failed and died.",
      "He then dons the Front Man's classic outfit from Season 1, a long gray coat and black mask. As Gi-hun and Jung-bae surrender (clearly outnumbered), the Front Man slowly descends down the steps to them and, through a voice modulator, asks Gi-hun, \"Did you have fun playing the hero?\"",
      "\"Look closely at the consequences of your little hero game,\" he says as he turns his loaded gun towards Jung-bae, killing him instantly.",
      "Gi-hun tries to fight back but is wrestled to the ground by pink suited workers as the Front Man (whom Gi-hun still doesn't know is Young-il) walks away.",
      "The show fades to black on Gi-hun screaming with grief as his head is pushed into the ground, forcing him to look at Jung-bae and the pool of blood spilling from him.",

      "\"That\u2019s how I wrote it,\" he told the outlet. \"But in the process, it came out to be too many episodes. So, I thought it\u2019d be better to divide it into two.\"",

And Blue joined her famous mom in the spotlight on Christmas Day during a halftime performance at a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Beyonc\u00e9's hometown team, the Houston Texans.",
      "In September 2024, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke to GQ about the delicate balance of being a global star and mother.",
      "\"I build my work schedule around my family,\" she told GQ. \"I try to only tour when my kids are out of school.\"",

      "\"One thing I\u2019ve worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn\u2019t turned into a brand,\" she said. \"It\u2019s very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art. I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.\"",
      "While parenting and sustaining a high-profile career has its challenges, she's also described it as deeply rewarding.",

      "\"She\u2019s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage,\" she said. \"Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, Blue joined Beyonc\u00e9's halftime performance at the Ravens and Texans game in Houston. She stood alongside her mom during \"Texas Hold 'Em\" to close out the set of songs from \"Cowboy Carter.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 honored her daughter's guest appearance by sneaking in a small lyric change, adding: \"Then spin me in the middle, Blue, I can\u2019t read your mind.\"",
      "While Blue is the most public of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s three children, she has managed to maintain a balance between her public appearances and private life.\u00a0On Feb. 20, 2024, she was seen supporting her mom at the launch of Beyonc\u00e9's new hair care line, C\u00e9cred, in LA. Then, at the 2024 Grammys, Jay-Z brought his daughter onstage to accept the second annual\u00a0Dr. Dre\u00a0Global Impact Award that he received at the event.",
      "In his acceptance speech, he gave Blue a shoutout, saying, \u201cThank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue\u2019s grown up now. She doesn\u2019t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys.\u201d",
      "Carter's eldest has been involved with voice work at a young age. In November 2020, Blue narrated Matthew A. Cherry\u2019s audiobook \u201cHair Love.\u201d In April 2024, Disney announced that she would voice cub Kiara, the daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, in Disney's new live-action prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 will also star in the project, voicing Nala.",

      "\"She\u2019s self-taught and she sounds like a concert pianist,\u201d Knowles said of Blue. \u201cShe paints, she draws, she does poetry. She\u2019s just an artistic soul.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really, really proud of her. I can\u2019t wait until the world gets to really hear.\u201d",
      "One of the highlights of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s massive \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour was having her daughter join her onstage as a dancer during her performance.",
      "Rumi Carter, 6",
      "Rumi Carter is the elder of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Like her twin brother, Sir Carter, Rumi was born on June 13, 2017.",
      "In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2019 Netflix documentary,\u00a0\"Homecoming,\" she opened up about the \u201cextremely difficult pregnancy\" that she went through when she had Rumi and Sir.",
      "\"My body went through more than I knew it could,\u201d she said in the documentary.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9's twins have since been featured in a few projects that she's worked on like her\u00a0\"Black is King\"\u00a0visual album, where they made an appearance. Rumi was also in the music video for \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\" along with her sister.",
      "Rumi also took center stage in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album. In the singer\u2019s song \u201cProtector,\u201d Rumi is heard asking her mom, \u201cCan I hear the lullaby please?\u201d at the beginning.",
      "The song appears to be a tribute to her children, with Beyonc\u00e9 singing about motherhood.",
      "She says, \u201cI first saw your face in your father\u2019s gaze/ There\u2019s a long line of hands carryin\u2019 your name, mm/ Liftin\u2019 you up, so you will be raised/ Even though I know someday you\u2019re going to shine on your own/ I will be your projector, yeah.\u201d",
      "Sir Carter, 6",
      "Sir Carter is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s youngest, though only by a minute, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Sir was born on  June 13, 2017, with his twin sister Rumi.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

      "Hoover addressed the ages of her characters during a panel with TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager in Texas in June 2023.",
      "\u201cBack when I wrote \u2018It Ends with Us,\u2019 the new adult (genre) was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That\u2019s what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young. I didn\u2019t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There\u2019s not a 20-something neurosurgeon,\u201d Hoover said.",
      "To correct her own mistake, Hoover said she met with the film\u2019s production team to tell them she wanted to use the film to make the characters more age appropriate.",
      "\u201cAs I started making this movie, I\u2019m like, we need to age them out, because I messed up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my fault.\u201d",
      "Hoover also spoke about the outfits seen in photos from the set during the interview.",
      "\u201cWhen I wrote the book, it wasn\u2019t about the age of the characters. It wasn\u2019t about what they were wearing. I don\u2019t even think I described any clothing in the book,\u201d Hoover said.",
      "\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve seen a few outfits that Lily has worn, but she looks so phenomenal on screen,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd some of the outfits that she\u2019s worn indoors that no one\u2019s gotten pictures of yet are phenomenal.\u201d",

She is a dynamic creative \u2014 she had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched she made better.\u201d",
      "After his show segment, Baldoni continued to speak about Lively in an interview with TODAY.com.",

So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",
      "Lively said in a statement, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 In Hong Kong, it\u2019s pandas, pandas, everywhere.",
      "About 2,500 giant panda sculptures are on display around Hong Kong as the Chinese territory hopes to capitalize on its growing panda population to regain its position as one of the top travel destinations in Asia.",
      "Hong Kong has struggled to attract tourists in their previous numbers after three years of pandemic border restrictions and a crackdown on dissent following 2019 antigovernment protests tarnished the city\u2019s international image.",
      "Hong Kong currently has six pandas. Its reigning pair, Ying Ying and Le Le, had twins in August, when Ying Ying become the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mother after years of failed breeding efforts. The cubs could make their public debut in February.",
      "In September, Hong Kong also welcomed a pair of 5-year-old pandas that were sent by Beijing, giving it the largest population of giant pandas outside mainland China.",
      "The panda windfall has inspired Hong Kong officials to talk about a \u201cpanda economy,\u201d encouraging restaurants and businesses to launch panda-themed products.",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s economy is closely intertwined with China\u2019s, and the recent slowdown in the mainland has been strongly felt here. Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2024 was downgraded to 2.5%, down from 3.2% last year.",
      "That is partly because tourism, a pillar of the Hong Kong economy, has failed to rebound.",
      "From January through October of this year, the city received almost 37 million visitors, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, an increase of 37% compared with the same period last year. But that is still well below the more than 50 million visitors Hong Kong received from January to October of 2019, a period that includes the start of the protests. (Lee fired his tourism secretary this month.)",
      "Mainland China continues to be the main source of tourists, accounting for more than 75% in October. But China\u2019s economic malaise has curtailed spending in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese visitors, many of whom make day trips from the city of Shenzhen across the border.",
      "Other ideas for revitalizing Hong Kong, such as the \u201cmega-event economy,\u201d have hit roadblocks as political sensitivities remain high. In February, the public was outraged when soccer star Lionel Messi failed to play in a heavily promoted exhibition game. Though Messi said he was too injured to play, fans and even government officials accused him of having \u201cpolitical motives.\u201d",
      "There are hopes that the panda campaign will go better.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a sight to see for first-time tourists like me,\u201d said Carol Lee Furiate, a visitor from California who had been to Hong Kong before but not the Big Buddha, a 112-foot bronze monument where about 70 panda sculptures are on display this month in the surrounding village and the cable car leading up to it.",
      "Even for visitors enjoying the panda exhibition at the Big Buddha, however, there was skepticism as to how much impact such events would have on the local economy.",
      "\u201cAfter taking pictures, people will leave. Will they stay here to eat or shop? Probably not,\u201d said Margaret Koon, a Hong Kong resident visiting the Big Buddha.",
      "Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the pandas would not be a big draw for international tourists because they are \u201cnot something that\u2019s part of the Hong Kong identity.\u201d Mainland Chinese tourists, meanwhile, can see plenty of pandas at home.",
      "Hong Kong should be trying to differentiate itself from other Chinese cities, Low said, and focusing on what makes it unique.",
      "He said global tourism is also moving away from high-end dining and shopping and tourist attractions and toward \u201cexperiencing the city as locals would.\u201d",

      "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point. The deadly incident in Magdeburg was another example of Islamist terrorism, they said \u2014 and a result of the mass immigration they so vehemently oppose.",
      "Except it wasn\u2019t that simple.",
      "The suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was in fact scathingly critical of Islam and immigration, according to his past posts on X. He aligned himself with the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is endorsed by Musk and monitored by German intelligence agencies for suspected extremism. While authorities say the motive is not yet clear, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect \u201cwas obviously Islamophobic.\u201d",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s complex worldview, in which he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but also Germany\u2019s alleged failure to protect Saudi immigrants from the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s repression, has muddied attempts to use his alleged killing of five people and injuring 200 others as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim cautionary tale. It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",
      "There has been \u201czero\u201d contrition from those on the right who sought to capitalize on the incident, said Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group focused on radical ideologies.",
      "Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has backed far-right figures in Europe, wrote on X that the \u201clegacy media lies again\u201d when news outlets, including NBC News, reported that officials described the suspect as Islamophobic.",
      "Other figures who were quick to interpret the attack have since kept quiet.",
      "\u201cThey despise our values,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders posted Friday on X. \u201cThis is our land, our freedom, our life. And we\u2019ll defend it and never surrender.\u201d",
      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",
      "These kinds of \u201cweirdo, individual, radical, conspiratorial worldviews\u201d are \u201ca phenomenon that has been rising steadily since the coronavirus, since we all moved our lives online and on social media,\u201d Schindler said.",

      "\u201cWe can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,\u201d he told Azerbaijani state television.",
      "Aliyev said that the airliner, which\u00a0crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan,\u00a0was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and \u201crendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.\u201d Aliyev accused Russia of trying to \u201chush up\u201d the issue for several days, saying he was \u201cupset and surprised\u201d by versions of events put forward by Russian officials.",

      "Aliyev noted that the first demand was \u201calready fulfilled\u201d when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a \u201ctragic incident\u201d though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow\u2019s responsibility.",
      "He said that an investigation into the crash was ongoing, and that \u201cthe final version (of events) will be known after the black boxes are opened.\u201d",
      "He noted that Azerbaijan was always \u201cin favor of a group of international experts\u201d investigating the crash, and had \u201ccategorically refused\u201d Russia\u2019s suggestion that the Interstate Aviation Committee, which oversees civil aviation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, investigate it.",
      "\u201cIt is no secret that this organization consists mostly of Russian officials and is headed by Russian citizens. The factors of objectivity could not be fully ensured here,\u201d Aliyev said.",

      "The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan was underway at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land.",
      "Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny.",
      "Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia\u2019s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic.",
      "The crash is the\u00a0second deadly civil aviation accident\u00a0linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014.",
      "Russia has denied responsibility, but a\u00a0Dutch court in 2022\u00a0convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base."

    "summary": "India\u2019s former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India\u2019s economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died.",
    "story": [
      "NEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India\u2019s economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died.",
      "He was 92.",
      "Singh was admitted to New Delhi\u2019s All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a \u201csudden loss of consciousness at home,\u201d the hospital said in a statement.",
      "\u201cResuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\u201d at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \u201cdespite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 p.m.\u201d",
      "Singh was being treated for \u201cage-related medical conditions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament\u2019s upper house, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the wife of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was re-elected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party\u2019s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India\u2019s \u201cmost distinguished leaders\u201d who rose from humble origins and left \u201ca strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Modi said in a post on the social platform X. He called Singh\u2019s interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker \u201cinsightful\u201d and said \u201chis wisdom and humility were always visible.\u201d",
      "Rahul Gandhi, from the same party as Singh and the opposition leader in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said Singh\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of economics inspired the nation\u201d and that he \u201cled India with immense wisdom and integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have lost a mentor and guide. Millions of us who admired him will remember him with the utmost pride,\u201d Gandhi, the son of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, wrote on X.",
      "The United States offered its condolences, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that Singh was \u201cone of the greatest champions of the U.S.-India strategic partnership.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mourn Dr. Singh\u2019s passing and will always remember his dedication to bringing the United States and India closer together,\u201d Blinken said.",
      "Born Sept. 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of pre-partition India, Singh\u2019s brilliant academic career took him to Cambridge University in Britain, where he earned a degree in economics in 1957. He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as an economic adviser in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India\u2019s second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India\u2019s upper house of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country\u2019s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country\u2019s various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India\u2019s nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",
      "He also tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet, which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "His 1965 book, \u201cIndia\u2019s Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth,\u201d dealt with India\u2019s inward-oriented trade policy.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife, Gursharan Kaur, and three daughters."
