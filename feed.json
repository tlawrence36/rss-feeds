      "Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried by ash and lava in 70 AD, has unearthed a new treasure: a private bathhouse built 2,000 years ago",
      "ROME -- Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried by ash and lava in 70 AD, has unearthed a new treasure -- a private bathhouse built 2,000 years ago, decorated with sumptuous mosaics and equipped with a series of hot, warm and cold rooms in the manner of a spa.",
      "\u201cWe have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\u201d said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \u201cThe members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.",
      "\u201cThey had the function of creating consensus, promoting an election campaign, closing deals. It was an opportunity to show the wealth in which they lived and also to have a nice thermal treatment,\" he explained.",
      "The baths were unearthed in the so -called Regio IX, a large central area of Pompeii park still unexplored, where major archaeological excavations are revealing new aspects of Pompeians' daily life.",
      "Recently, archeologists working in the same area found a bakery, a laundry shop, two villas and the bones of three people who died during the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed both the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
      "Zuchtriegel said wealthy habitants of Pompeii often used first to take a bath and then to have a banquet, so the private spa complex allowed to do that altogether inside the same house.",
      "\u201cThere is room for about 30 people who could do the whole routine, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the calidarium, a very warm environment and also a large tub with cold water,\u201d he said.",

      "Award-winning British stage actor Joan Plowright, the widow of Laurence Olivier, has died",
      "LONDON -- Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who was one half of a theatrical power couple after marrying Laurence Olivier, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\u201cShe enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors \u2014 including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith \u2014 Plowright won a Tony Award and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was awarded the title of dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Seagull\u201d to Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice.\u201d She stunned in Eugene Ionesco\u2019s \u201cThe Chairs,\u201d and George Bernard Shaw\u2019s totemic two female roles \u201cMajor Barbara\u201d and \u201cSaint Joan.\u201d",
      "Plowright appeared in plays by John Osborne, Shelagh Delaney and Arnold Wesker. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor and director Justin Baldoni has sued his co-star Blake Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, for defamation and extortion on Thursday in the latest move in a bitter legal battle surrounding the dark romantic drama.",
      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich",
      "NEW YORK -- Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.",
      "All around the room is a buzzing clutter of period analog equipment. The video monitors act like windows, offering perspectives of the drama just outside: the taking of Israeli Olympic team members by the Palestinian militant group Black September.",
      "Inside the control room are the sports producers who were thrown into covering one of the first breaking news events televised worldwide. Some 900 million viewers are estimated to have watched.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a taut procedural recently nominated for best film, drama, by the Golden Globes, suggests this was a seminal moment in media history. Inside the control room, a handful of producers reckon in real time with questions that still pervade today\u2019s journalism: What\u2019s appropriate to show? Are we informing or sensationalizing? Do we have our facts straight?",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes.

      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",
      "Christopher Abbott stars as Blake, a father and husband whose own estranged dad was a tad unstable, constantly drilling in his son a survivalist ethic. \u201cIt's not hard to die.

      "A weird human-animal hybrid lurking in the Oregon wilderness \u2014 actually New Zealand pretending to be Oregon \u2014 kicks off what is supposed to be the scary part of this movie, but so much time is spent on the domestic drama set-up that the audience will be bored by the time the supposed thrill ride shows up. When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",

      "\u201cBefore we begin, on behalf of everyone at BAFTA, our thoughts are with colleagues, friends and peers and all those affected by the devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area,\u201d actor Will Sharpe said before he and fellow actor Mia McKenna-Bruce announced the nominations.",
      "BAFTA chair Sara Putt would not say whether the fires may impact the ceremony, which is due to take place Feb. 16 at the Royal Festival Hall in London, hosted by Scottish actor David Tennant.",
      "\u201cThe ceremony is a month away. It would be inappropriate and far too early to say anything about that,\u201d Putt told The Associated Press.",
      "The five films nominated for the best film award were \u201c Conclave,\u201d \u201c Emilia Perez,\u201d the 215-minute postwar epic \u201d The Brutalist,\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or-winning comedy/drama \u201c Anora \u2033 and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201c A Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d had nine nominations, including leading actor for Adrien Brody, who faces stiff competition from Fiennes and Timothee Chalamet, who plays the young Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "The other actors nominated are Hugh Grant for his creepy role in the horror film \u201c Heretic,\u201d Colman Domingo in real-life prison drama \u201c Sing Sing \u201d and Sebastian Stan for his portrayal of a real estate mogul \u2014 a certain Donald Trump \u2014 in \u201c The Apprentice.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d the sci-fi epic \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d each received seven nominations. \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d received six nominations, as did \u201cKneecap,\u201d the Irish-language hip-hop drama.",
      "The prizes \u2014 officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards \u2014 are Britain\u2019s equivalent of Hollywood\u2019s Academy Awards and will be watched closely for hints of who may win at the Oscars on March 3.",
      "Putt praised the variety in the nominations, noting that six different genres were represented on the best film list.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some really exciting stories in there and just a real glorious range of film-making this year,\u201d she said.",
      "She also highlighted that 14 of the 24 nominations in the acting categories were first-timers, and that whoever takes the best actress award will be a first-time BAFTA winner.",
      "Demi Moore has a chance, with a nomination for lead actress for her role in the body horror film \u201c The Substance.\u201d",
      "Other notable nominations for best supporting actress were Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande for their roles in \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d and the musical \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Like other major movie awards, Britain's film academy has introduced changes in recent years to increase diversity. In 2020, no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running, and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.",
      "The voting process was changed to add a longlist round in the selection before the final nominees are voted on by the academy\u2019s 8,000-strong membership of industry professionals.",
      "One notable absentee from Wednesday's shortlist was Denzel Washington, who had featured on the longlist released last month, and who had been nominated for his role as a bisexual scheming owner of gladiators in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201c Gladiator II.\u201d",
      "Edward Berger, the German-born director of \u201cConclave,\u201d expressed his joy at the number of nominations received, including one for himself, but acknowledged the \u201cstrange\u201d time to be celebrating when everyone\u2019s thoughts are with the people of Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cTo feel their strength is very, very inspiring,\u201d he said."

      "Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman has released a statement denying he has ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman released a statement Wednesday denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine this week published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault.",
      "The 64-year-old author of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d comic book series and novel \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was responding to a New York Magazine article that detailed allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women. The allegations of four of them had been broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "Gaiman said he had watched stories about him circulate on the Internet for months with \u201chorror and dismay.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don\u2019t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. I\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Gaiman said he had read back message exchanges he had had with his accusers. They still read like \u201ctwo people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd I also realise, looking through them, years later, that I could have and should have done so much better. I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings, and that\u2019s something that I really, deeply regret,\u201d Gaiman said.",
      "Most of the allegations relate to occasions when Gaiman was in his 40s or older and living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand.",
      "One of the accusers, Scarlett Pavlovich, told New York Magazine she met Gaiman through his then-wife, U.S. performer Amanda Palmer, on a New Zealand island where the couple lived with their son in 2022. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman abused her several times starting the night they met.",
      "Some of Pavlovich\u2019s allegations were first made public six months earlier in the podcast.",
      "She told the magazine she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault.",
      "New Zealand Police this week would not say whether Gaiman was, or had been, under investigation.",
      "\u201cIn general, Police cannot respond to queries which seek to establish whether specific individuals are, or have been, under Police investigation. Additionally, anyone who makes a complaint to Police has the right to privacy,\u201d New Zealand Police told The Associated Press in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The AP\u2019s messages to Gaiman\u2019s agent, his office and to Bloomsbury, publisher of several of his recent books, were not returned.",
      "Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which both have Gaiman-related projects scheduled for this year, haven't responded to the AP\u2019s messages.",
      "Several of Gaiman's works have been turned into movies and television programs."

      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing",
      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles last Tuesday, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing. The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after.",
      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled. With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",
      "Focus has turned, instead, to what the Oscars might symbolize for a traumatized Los Angeles. The Oscars have never meant less, but, at the same time, they might be more important than ever as a beacon of perseverance for the reeling movie capital.",
      "The film academy on Monday for the second time delayed its nominations announcement. Nominations will now be announced virtually on Feb. 23. The academy also canceled its annual nominees luncheon and said it\u2019s planning to honor frontline workers and to support relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community,\u201d vowed Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, academy president.",
      "The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, continue. The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama children with physical disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday, warning it would file suit against the state unless changes are made to allow more of these children to live at home.",
      "A Justice Department investigation found Alabama is violating the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act to administer services to individuals with disabilities in the setting most appropriate to the person\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cMany children with physical disabilities in Alabama are unnecessarily institutionalized or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote to state officials.",
      "Clarke announced the probe's findings in a letter to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama Department of Senior Services. It listed changes the state should make to provide more community services and threatened a federal lawsuit if action isn't taken.",
      "Alabama\u2019s Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s office referred questions to the state agencies. The Department of Human Resources did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.",
      "The federal investigation found that Alabama policies effectively limit community-based services, or long-term support services, which allow children with physical disabilities to live at home.",
      "Federal officials said the state has not adequately developed its community-based workforce. The Justice Department also said Alabama fails to support foster parents who care for, or are considering caring for, children with physical disabilities.",

      "\u201cSome children who could otherwise be cared for in family homes have spent their formative years growing up in nursing homes, separated from their families and communities.

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia.

Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Most states cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level with primarily federal funds. Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",
      "Kemp will have to get approval for his plans from the Trump administration, as the program is set to expire in September. Talks are already underway, Kemp said, calling the incoming administration a \u201cfederal partner that wants to innovate efficiently.\u201d",
      "He said the Biden administration has meanwhile \u201cunfortunately been more interested in finding ways to stop or undermine our efforts rather than working with us.\u201d",
      "Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said the governor's new plan would cost an additional $207,000. In an effort to boost enrollment, the state recently invested $10.7 million to raise awareness about Georgia Pathways.",

      "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
      "U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",
      "Lawmakers cited the Delaney Clause and said the action was especially important to protect children, who consume more of the dye on a bodyweight basis than adults, the lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cThe FDA should act quickly to protect the nation's youth from this harmful dye, used simply to give food and drinks a bright red color,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo aesthetic reason could justify the use of a carcinogen in our food supply.\u201d",
      "Red 3 is banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand except in certain kinds of cherries. The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027.",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3.

      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",

      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",

      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",

      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",

      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "The issue has had a negative effects on the television company's share price and led to one of its largest shareholders to write a letter expressing concerns over its corporate governance.",
      "Fuji TV President Koichi Minato on Friday apologized for \u201ccausing tremendous trouble and concern due to the (media) reports\u201d and said an external panel would investigate the actions of company officials, including himself.",
      "The scandal stems from reports that began in December by the Shukan Bunshun weekly magazine that Nakai had reached a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement with a woman in connection with alleged sexual misconduct at a dinner party last year.",
      "Nakai acknowledged in a Jan. 9 statement on his official website that he had reached a settlement with a woman over \u201ca trouble.\u201d He denied using any violence or anyone else's involvement, saying he sincerely responded to the woman\u2019s requests in the settlement.",
      "\u201cThis trouble is entirely because of my shortcomings,\u201d Nakai said in the statement.",
      "The announcement of a formal inquiry comes after Rising Sun Management, which is an affiliate of U.S. investment management firm Dalton Investments -- which partially owns Fuji TV - criticized the network\u2019s lack of transparency and demanded an investigation by a third party.",
      "\u201cThe uproar created by Mr. Masahiro Nakai ... reflects not only a problem in the entertainment industry generally, but, specifically, it exposes serious flaws in your corporate governance,\u201d Rising Sun said in an open letter to the board of Fuji dated Jan. 14.",
      "\u201cThe lack of consistency and, importantly, transparency in both reporting the facts and the subsequent unforgivable shortcomings in your response merit serious condemnation that serves not only to undermine viewer trust, but also leads directly to erode shareholder value. As one of your largest shareholders, controlling over 7% percent of the company\u2019s stock, we are outraged!\u201d",
      "Nakai was a leader of SMAP, a five-member singing and dancing male band, which debuted in 1988 and quickly surged to stardom in Japan and across Asia until it was disbanded in 2016.",
      "Major Japanese TV networks have suspended programs hosted by him or edited him out of footage following the allegations.",
      "Nippon Television Network Corp. said Nakai was to step down as host of a variety program following a thorough review of the situation.",
      "The scandal comes after now-defunct talent agency Johnny & Associates, which managed SMAP and many other groups, admitted in 2023 to sexual abuse against hundreds of teenage boys and young men by its late founder and entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa.",

      "Shortly after, Lebanon's parliament overcame a stalemate that had left the presidency vacant for over two years. That cleared the way for the naming of nomination of a permanent prime minister, prominent jurist and diplomat Nawaf Salam.",
      "Lebanon's government hopes the political breakthrough will boost international confidence and clear the way for the release funds needed for reconstruction caused by the Israel-Hezbollah war, which killed more than 4,000 and wounded over 16,000 in Lebanon. An international conference for Lebanon in Paris in October raised $1 billion in pledges for humanitarian aid and military support.",
      "Macron was received at Beirut\u2019s international airport by caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and was expected to head to the country\u2019s south, where French troops are deployed part of a U.N. peacekeeping force along the border with Israel.",
      "\u201cThis is a message of gratitude,\u201d Macron told journalists at the airport.",
      "The French leader has been a harsh critic of Lebanon\u2019s political class, whom many blame for the decades of corruption and mismanagement that led in October 2019 to the country\u2019s worst economic and financial crisis.",
      "For years, Macron has pressed Lebanese officials to implement reforms to help the former French protectorate out of an economic crisis that the World Bank described as among the worst the world has witnessed in more than a century. Few steps have been taken by the country\u2019s rulers since then.",
      "Macron is scheduled to meet Salam and President Joseph Aoun. Aoun and the prime minister-designate have promised to work on getting Lebanon out of its economic crisis and to impose state authority over parts of the country long controlled by Hezbollah.",
      "\u201cPresident Macron promised to keep support for the new government,\u201d Mikati said after meeting the French leader at the airport. He added that Macron will meet early Friday with the U.S. and French officers on the ceasefire monitoring committee and will later meet Lebanese officials.",
      "Asked if France can guarantee that Israel will withdraw its troops from Lebanon, by the end of the 60-day truce, Mikati said this was not discussed, adding that the French side is following the matter with U.S. officials.",
      "The Israel-Hezbollah war has weakened Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that dominated Lebanese politics for years. Hezbollah favored other candidates for president and prime minister and has criticized the choices of Aoun and Salam.",
      "Macron last visited Lebanon in August 2020, days after a massive port blast in Beirut killed over 200 people and wounded thousands."

      "PARACHINAR, Pakistan -- The death toll from a rocket and gun attack on an aid convoy in restive northwestern Pakistan has jumped to at least five, local authorities said Friday.",
      "The attack happened Thursday when trucks carrying food, medicine and other relief supplies for hundreds of thousands of besieged residents were heading to Kurram, a district hit by sectarian violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
      "Authorities initially said a security officer was killed in the attack, but Shaukat Ali, a district administrator in Kurram, said on Friday that another officer had died at a hospital and the bodies of three missing truck drivers had been found.",
      "He said five drivers were still missing and their trucks had been burned by the attackers.",
      "No one has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kurram, which has been the scene of violence between Shiite and Sunni tribes since July 2024. The violence surged in November when attackers opened fire on vehicles carrying passengers, killing 52 people, mostly Shiites. Since then, at least 130 people have died in violence there.",
      "Thursday's attack came weeks after the government secured a ceasefire deal between tribal leaders.",
      "Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant Sunni groups previously targeting minority Shiites."

      "A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, according to satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A mysterious airstrip being built on a remote island in Yemen is nearing completion, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show, one of several built in a nation mired in a stalemated war threatening to reignite.",
      "The airstrip on Abd al-Kuri Island, which rises out of the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, could provide a key landing zone for military operations patrolling that waterway. That could be useful as commercial shipping through the Gulf and Red Sea \u2014 a key route for cargo and energy shipments heading to Europe \u2014 has halved under attacks by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The area also has seen weapons smuggling from Iran to the rebels.",
      "The runway is likely built by the United Arab Emirates, which has long been suspected of expanding its military presence in the region and has backed a Saudi-led war against the Houthis.",
      "While the Houthis have linked their campaign to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, experts worry a ceasefire in that conflict may not be enough to see the rebels halt a campaign that's drawn them global attention. Meanwhile, the Houthis have lobbed repeated attacks at Israel, as well as U.S. warships operating in the Red Sea, raising fears that one may make it through and endanger the lives of American service members.",
      "A battlefield miscalculation by Yemen\u2019s many adversarial parties, new fatal attacks on Israel or a deadly assault on an American warship easily could shatter the country\u2019s relative calm. And it remains unclear just how President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday, will handle the emboldened rebel group.",
      "\u201cThe Houthis feed off war \u2014 war is good for them,\u201d said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Yemen. \u201cFinally they can live up to their slogan, which famously, of course, declares, \u2018Death to America, death to the Jews.\u2019 They see themselves as being in this epic battle against their archenemies and from their view, they're winning.\u201d",
      "Satellite photos taken Jan. 7 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show trucks and other heavy equipment on the north-south runway built into Abd al-Kuri, which is about 35 kilometers (21 miles) in length and about 5 kilometers (3 miles) at its widest point.",
      "The runway has been paved, with the designation markings \u201c18\u201d and \"36\" to the airstrip's north and south respectively. As of Jan. 7, there was still a segment missing from the 2.4-kilometer- (1.5-mile-) long runway that's 45-meters (150-feet) wide. Trucks could be seen grading and laying asphalt over the missing 290-meter (950-foot) segment.",
      "Once completed, the runway's length would allow private jets and other aircraft to land there, though likely not the largest commercial aircraft or heavy bombers given its length.",
      "While within Houthi drone and missile range, the distance of Abd al-Kuri from mainland Yemen means \u201cthere\u2019s no threat of the Houthis getting on a pickup truck or a technical and going to seize it,\" said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The United Nations' Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization, which assigns its own set of airport codes for airfields around the world, had no information about the airstrip on Abd al-Kuri, spokesman William Raillant-Clark said. Yemen, as a member state to ICAO, should provide information about the airfield to the organization. Nearby Socotra Island already has an airport declared to the ICAO.",
      "It's not the only airfield to see an expansion in recent years. In Mocha on the Red Sea, a project to extend that city's airport now allows it to land far larger aircraft. Local officials attributed that project to the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The airfield also sits on a similar north-south path as the Abd al-Kuri airstrip and is roughly the same length.",
      "Other satellite photos from Planet Labs show yet another unclaimed runway currently under construction just south of Mocha near Dhubab, a coastal town in Yemen's Taiz governorate. An image taken by Planet for the AP on Thursday showed the runway fully built, though no markings were painted on it.",
      "Abd al-Kuri is part of the Socotra Archipelago, separated from Africa by only 95 kilometers (60 miles) and from Yemen by some 400 kilometers (250 miles). In the last decade of the Cold War, the archipelago occasionally hosted Soviet warships due to its strategic location.",
      "In recent years, the island has been overseen by Yemen's Southern Transitional Council, which advocates for Yemen to again split into a separate north and south as it was during the Cold War. The UAE has backed and armed the council as part of the Saudi-led war against the Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014.",
      "The UAE, home to the massive Jebel Ali port in Dubai and the logistic firm DP World, previously built a base in Eritrea that was later dismantled and attempted to build an airstrip on Mayun, or Perim, Island, in the center of the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.",
      "But unlike those efforts, the Emiratis appear likely to open the Abd al-Kuri airstrip \u2014 and have even signed their work. Just east of the runway, piles of dirt there have spelled out \u201cI LOVE UAE\u201d for months.",
      "An Emirati-flagged landing craft also was spotted off the coast of Abd al-Kuri in January 2024 and off Socotra multiple other times in the year, according to data analyzed by AP from MarineTraffic.com. That vessel previously has been associated with the UAE's military operations in Yemen.",
      "The UAE, which runs a once-a-week flight to Socotra via Abu Dhabi, have long described their efforts as aimed at getting aid to the archipelago. Asked for comment about the Abd al-Kuri airfield, the UAE similarly pointed to its aid operations.",
      "\u201cAny presence of the UAE ... is based on humanitarian grounds that is carried out in cooperation with the Yemen government and local authorities,\" the Emirati government said in a statement.",
      "\"The UAE remains steadfast in its commitment to all international endeavors aimed at facilitating the resumption of the Yemeni political process, thereby advancing the security, stability and prosperity sought by the Yemeni populace.\u201d",
      "The Southern Transitional Council and officials with Yemen's exiled government did not respond to repeated requests for comments over the airfield. The UAE's presence on Socotra has sparked tensions in the past, something the Houthis have used to portray the Emiratis as trying to colonize the island.",
      "\u201cThis plan represents a serious violation of Yemeni sovereignty and threatens the sovereignty of several neighboring countries through the espionage and sabotage operations it is expected to carry out,\u201d the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency said in November.",
      "A new airport on Abd al-Kuri could provide a new, secluded landing zone for surveillance flights around Socotra Island. That could be vital to interdict weapons smuggling from Iran to the Houthis, who remain under a U.N. arms embargo.",
      "A report to the U.N. Security Council said a January 2024 weapons seizure by the U.S. military took place off Socotra near Abd al-Kuri. That seizure, which saw two U.S. Navy SEALs lost at sea and presumed killed, involved a traditional dhow vessel that U.S. prosecutors say was involved in multiple smuggling trips on behalf of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard to the Houthis.",
      "Disrupting that weapons route, as well as the ongoing attacks by the U.S., Israel and others on the Houthis, likely have contributed to the slowing pace of the rebels' attacks in recent months. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Next week, Trump will be the one to decide what happens to that campaign. He has experience already with how difficult fighting in Yemen can be \u2014 his first military action in his first term in 2017 saw a Navy SEAL killed in a raid on a suspected al-Qaida compound. The raid also killed more than a dozen civilians, including an 8-year-old girl.",
      "Trump may reapply a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis that Biden revoked, a reimposition that the UAE backs. Marco Rubio, who Trump has nominated to be secretary of state, mentioned the Houthis several times when testifying Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing alongside what he described as threats from Iran and its allies.",
      "Any U.S. move could escalate the war, even with the Houthi's enigmatic supreme leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, pledging Thursday night to halt the rebels' attacks if a ceasefire deal is reached in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see a way in 2025 that we have a de-escalation with the Houthis,\u201d said al-Basha, the Yemen expert. \u201cThe situation in Yemen is very tense. An outbreak in the war could be a reality in the next few months. I don\u2019t foresee the status quo continuing.\u201d"

      "The CBP One app has brought nearly 1 million people to the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work since January 2023, but it could end under President-elect Donald Trump",
      "TIJUANA, Mexico -- A nurse who fled Cuba as part of the Caribbean nation\u2019s largest exodus in more than six decades needed a place to stay in Mexico as she waited to legally enter the U.S. using a government app. A woman who had lived her whole life in the same Tijuana neighborhood was desperate for medical help after a dog attack left her with wounds to her legs.",
      "A mutual acquaintance brought the two women together. Nurse Karla Figueredo stayed with Martha Rosales for three days in October 2023, waiting for a border appointment booked through the CBP One app and treating Rosales\u2019 dog bites. When Figueredo left for the U.S., she got Rosales\u2019 permission to give her name to other migrants.",
      "Word quickly spread and Rosales made her home part of a roster of at least three dozen migrant shelters in her hometown on the U.S.-Mexico border, temporarily housing people who use the CBP One app.",
      "\u201cI told God that if they didn\u2019t amputate my feet, I would help every Cuban,\u201d said Rosales, 45, who was using a wheelchair after being attacked by five dogs until Figueredo helped heal her wounds.",
      "CBP One has brought nearly 1 million people to the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work but could go away once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Figueredo, 25, now works as a medical assistant in the Houston area and keeps in touch with Rosales, who quit her job as a bank cleaner to focus on her migrant shelter. The people Rosales houses, mostly Cubans, refer to her as \u201c\u2019T\u00eda Martha\u201d (Aunt Martha) as she cooks pancake breakfasts, throws birthday parties and shuttles them to their CBP One appointments.",
      "Supporters say CBP One has helped bring order to the border and reduced illegal crossings. But Trump has said he would end it as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Critics say it prioritizes a lottery system over people who have long lived in the U.S. illegally while paying taxes and people who have waited years for visas.",
      "Dayron Garcia, a doctor in Cuba who heard about Rosales from a nephew, applied with his wife and children and plans to settle with a friend in Houston. He said Rosales\u2019 house \u201cfeels like family\u201d and that \u201cCBP One has been a salvation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a guarantee,\u201d Garcia, 40, said. \u201cYou enter with papers, with parole.\u201d",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection debuted CBP One near the end of Trump\u2019s first term as a way for customs brokers to schedule inspections and for visitors with short-term visas to extend stays.",
      "The Biden administration extended its use to migrants to replace an opaque patchwork of exemptions to a pandemic-related asylum ban that was then in place.",
      "CBP One is popular with Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and Mexicans, likely because advocates in their communities promote it.",
      "Illegal border crossings by Cubans plunged under CBP One from a peak of nearly 35,000 in April 2022 to just 97 in September.",
      "Demand for appointments has far outstripped supply, with an average of about 280,000 people competing for 1,450 daily slots toward the end of last year, according to CBP. Winners must report to a border crossing in three weeks.",
      "Migrant shelters along Mexico\u2019s border with the U.S. are now occupied primarily by people seeking the online appointments.",
      "Rosales' house is in a neighborhood with ramshackle homes where old tires are stacked to stop flash floods. Migrants watch television, play billiards, do chores and look after their children at Rosales' house or a rental home nearby. Those who don\u2019t yet have appointments work their phones for slots made available daily at eight U.S. border crossings with Mexico, a task likened to trying to buy Taylor Swift concert tickets.",
      "Rosales works throughout the night. A helper drives to the airport in an SUV Rosales bought with retirement pay from her bank job.",
      "Shortly after midnight, she shuttles guests from her house to Tijuana's main border crossing with San Diego for the day's first appointments at 5 a.m. She chats with them, smiles for photos and hugs people goodbye.",
      "By 3 a.m., she is at a television station for a four-hour shift cleaning the newsroom and fetching coffee for journalists, who give her the latest information on immigration and the city.",
      "She checks her phone for migrants needing shelter who heard about her on social media or from friends and family. Her contact list identifies them by size of party and appointment date: \u201c3 on the 16th,\u201d \u201c6 on the 17th.\u201d",
      "Rosales, one of 13 children, dropped out of school in third grade. Reading the Bible taught her enough to barely understand texts, which she generally responds to with voice messages or calls.",
      "Enrique Lucero was Tijuana's director of migrant affairs when she came to City Hall for advice. He helped Rosales establish a legal entity to raise money and made himself available for emergencies, such as when a woman missed her CBP One appointment to give birth. Lucero talked to CBP to make sure the woman and her baby got in.",
      "\u201cShe worries about them. She cries for them,\" Lucero said.",
      "Border arrests of Cubans increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and after anti-government protests in 2021. Nicaragua had recently eased rules for Cubans to fly from Havana, allowing them to avoid walking through the Darien Gap, a dangerous jungle in Colombia and Panama. By the spring of 2022, Cubans eclipsed all nationalities but Mexicans in illegal crossings.",
      "\u201cCBP One came like a gift from God,\u201d said Yoandis Delgado, who flew to Nicaragua in 2023, paid a smuggler $1,000 to reach southern Mexico and was repeatedly robbed by Mexican authorities while trying to reach the U.S. border. \u201cCBP One gave us a sense of possibility, of hope.\u201d",
      "Delgado, a cook in Cuba, said Rosales' home and neighborhood don't stand out for people seeking to prey on migrants, giving a sense of security he wouldn't get at hotels or other shelters.",
      "\u201cShe lives in the same condition that we do, not any better,\u201d Delgado said after a pancake breakfast. \u201cShe cries for everything that happens to us, for what we have suffered to get here from Cuba.\u201d",
      "Biden administration officials portray CBP One as a key success in its strategy to create legal pathways at the border while deterring illegal crossings. They note people in life-threatening circumstances can come to a border crossing without an appointment to plead their case.",
      "Anxiety is spreading among migrants in Mexico who fear Trump will end CBP One. Even those in the U.S. are uneasy because parole expires after two years.",
      "The Trump transition team didn't respond to a question about CBP One's future, but his allies say it's overly generous and encourages immigration. A bill that stalled in the Senate in 2023 would have prohibited using the app to admit migrants.",
      "Figueredo, the nurse who helped Rosales, plans to get a green card under a 1966 law that applies to Cubans. She says she and her partner, a barber, came to \u201ccontinue to grow professionally and support our future children.\u201d",
      "She writes Rosales often, telling her that her job is \u201ccrazy\u201d busy and asking about her health. \u201cI hope you\u2019re very happy,\u201d she wrote.",

      "What to know about the Russian-Iranian relationship:",
      "Russia and Iran fought wars in the 18th and 19th centuries, with the Russian Empire capturing broad territories in the Caucasus and the Caspian region previously controlled by Persian rulers. In the early 20th century, Russian troops occupied large parts of northern Iran, but the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution ended their presence. In World War II, the Soviet Union and Britain invaded Iran, which still evokes painful memories in Tehran.",
      "Tensions ran high in the Cold War, when Tehran was a U.S. ally under the Shah of Iran. After his ouster in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini castigated the U.S. as the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d and denounced the USSR as the \u201cLesser Satan.\u201d",
      "Russia-Iran ties warmed after the USSR's demise in 1991. Moscow became an important trade partner and a key supplier of weapons and high technologies to Iran, which faced isolation from sweeping international sanctions.",
      "Russia built Iran\u2019s first nuclear power plant in the port of Bushehr that became operational in 2013. The next year, Moscow signed a contract to build two more nuclear reactors.",
      "Russia was part of the 2015 deal between Iran and six nuclear powers offering sanctions relief for Tehran in exchange for curbing its atomic program and opening it to broader international scrutiny. Moscow offered political support to Iran when the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the agreement during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "After a civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, Russia and Iran pooled efforts to shore up Bashar Assad's government against Turkey-backed rebels seeking his ouster. In 2015, Russia launched a military campaign in Syria, joining Iran and its proxies, that helped Assad re-establish control in most of the country.",

Israel attacked Iran directly twice, and Israeli officials claimed the raids took out Tehran's Russia-supplied S-300 air defense systems.",

      "China said Friday that its population fell for the third straight year in 2024, falling by almost 1.4 million to 1.408 billion. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's population has been falling for 15 years, while South Korea's growth turned negative in 2021. In Italy, the number of births has fallen below 400,000 for the first time since the 19th century.",
      "The population has peaked in 63 countries and territories, about half in Europe, the United Nations says. The U.N. projects another 48 will hit their peak over the next 30 years.",
      "Globally, the population of 8.2 billion people is still growing, with the U.N. projecting it will reach 10.3 billion in roughly 60 years and then start to decline.",
      "For many countries with shrinking populations, the slow-moving but hard-to-reverse trend has prompted governments to offer financial incentives to try to encourage people to have children to help support growing numbers of elders.",
      "The Japanese government\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, called the demographic situation critical last year, saying that the next six years will be \u201cthe last chance for us to possibly reverse the trend.\u201d",
      "The population of Japan peaked in 2008 at 128 million people and has fallen to 125 million since then. The number of births hit a record low of 730,000 in 2023.",
      "Surveys show that younger Japanese are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children, discouraged by bleak job prospects, a cost of living that is rising at a faster pace than salaries and a corporate culture difficult for women and working mothers.",
      "Japan\u2019s population is projected to fall to 87 million people by 2070, when four out of every 10 people will be 65 years of age or older.",
      "One segment of the population is still growing: an 11% increase in foreign residents helped push their population above 3 million for the first time in 2023, making up nearly 3% of the total.",
      "China is growing older, a trend that could sap economic growth and challenge the government\u2019s capacity to provide for a larger elderly population with fewer workers.",
      "Some see opportunity. An \u201celderly university\u2019 in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has enrolled 150 students in dance, singing, yoga and modeling classes. The business has yet to break even but founder Liu Xiuqin believes in the market\u2019s future, given the value that retirees born in the 1960s place on quality of life and health compared to earlier generations.",
      "The government is raising the retirement age over the next 15 years to 63 from 60 years old for men; to 55 from 50 for women in factory and other blue-collar jobs and to 58 from 55 for women in white-collar work.",
      "China ceded its position as the most populated country to India in 2023, after the population began to fall in 2022. Women are having fewer babies despite the easing of China\u2019s one-child policy to allow up to three children.",
      "The population of 1.4 billion people \u2014 still more than 10 times that of Japan \u2014 is projected to fall to 1.3 billion by 2050.",
      "Backed by the Vatican, a succession of Italian governments have vowed to address the social, economic and cultural reasons behind one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates.",
      "Pope Francis has repeatedly urged Italians to have more children to invert what he has called the demographic winter facing many industrialized countries.",
      "The government of Premier Giorgia Meloni has a campaign to encourage at least 500,000 births annually by 2033, a rate that demographers say is necessary to grow the wage-earning population and prevent the economy from collapsing as retirees draw on their pensions.",
      "The number of births has fallen steadily from about 577,000 in 2008 to 380,000 in 2023, the first year since Italy\u2019s unification that the number fell below 400,000.",
      "Studies say that's due to a combination of factors, including a lack of openings for affordable child care, low salaries and a tradition of women caring for older parents.",
      "South Korea's population rebounded in 2023 thanks to an influx of foreigners.",
      "The birthrate fell again in a country where many younger people don't feel the same obligation to have children that their parents and grandparents did.",
      "Some are put off by the high cost of raising children in a highly competitive education system and a patriarchal culture that forces women to take on most childcare duties.",
      "The number of foreign residents rose 10% to 1.9 million people, partly because of an extension of a working visa program, the country's Yonhap news agency reported, citing the government statistics agency.",
      "That was enough to boost the total population ever so slightly -- by 0.2% to 51.8 million people.",
      "Of those, 9.5 million are 65 or older. The demographic trends have sparked concern about labor shortages and strains on the government budget.",

      "Cuba has released prominent dissident Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer from jail, as part of a Cuban government decision to gradually free more than 500 prisoners as part of talks with the Vatican",
      "HAVANA -- Cuba on Thursday released prominent dissident Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer from prison, as part of a government decision to gradually free more than 500 prisoners following talks with the Vatican.",
      "Ferrer, a strong opponent of the island's communist government, confirmed to The Associated Press he was freed and that he was at home in Palma Soriano, a town in the province of Santiago, more than 600 miles east of Havana.",
      "\u201cI am fine, surrounded by family and friends,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cI had been arbitrarily imprisoned for the third time, and a false judicial process had been set up.\u201d",

      "On Tuesday, the U.S. government said it notified Congress about the intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Catholic Church, and that Cuban authorities would release some of them by the end of the Biden administration at noon on Jan. 20.",
      "Cuba then informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore the legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen. Havana said, however, that the gesture to the pontiff is unrelated to the U.S. decision to lift the designation.",
      "Cuban civil groups monitoring the cases of detainees on the island say Cuba has released about 30 people in the past two days, including Ferrer.",
      "In 2020, after being in prison for six months, Ferrer was placed under house arrest after a court sentenced him to 4 1/2 years for assault and kidnapping. But then in 2021 he was sent back to jail after participating in historic, widespread protests over food shortages and power outages amid a severe economic crisis.",
      "Ferrer, director of the political organization Patriotic Union of Cuba, said that he's already thinking of continuing his fight for democracy.",
      "\u201cI am going to meet up with my friends and my brothers (in the cause) now,\" he said. \u201cAnd I am going to continue the non-violent struggle for freedom and democracy.\u201d",

      "Pakistan\u2019s national airline says that an advertisement showing a plane heading toward the Eiffel Tower was never intended to evoke the memories of the Sept. 11 attacks",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan\u2019s national airline said Thursday that an advertisement showing a plane heading toward the Eiffel Tower was never intended to evoke the memories of the Sept. 11 attacks.",
      "The illustration, not in video format, shows a plane superimposed over the French flag and tilted toward the Paris landmark, with the words \u201cParis, we're coming today.\u201d",
      "The ad was posted on X by Pakistan International Airlines, or PIA, on Jan. 10, the day that the company resumed flights to European Union countries after a four-year ban by the bloc's aviation safety agency.",
      "Many social media users immediately decried the ad, and Pakistan's prime minister called for an inquiry. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar described the ad as an act of \u201cstupidity.\u201d",
      "PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said Thursday that the ad, which hasn't been deleted and has more than 21.2 million views, was only ever meant to celebrate that the airline was resuming flights to Europe, and never intended to harm 9/11 survivors or victims' families.",
      "Hafeez told The Associated Press that he was surprised over the criticism. But he said that \u201cwe apologize to those who feel the advertisement hurt them.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it clear that we had no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone,\" Hafeez said.",
      "He said that the Eifel Tower was shown in the ad because it's one of the best places in the world.",
      "Curbs on PIA had been imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot\u2019s exams. A government investigation later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.",
      "The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.",
      "Pakistan has some connections to the Sept. 11 attacks. One of the 9/11 masterminds, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was detained in the country in 2003. In 2011, Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. special forces raid in Pakistan."

      "On Christmas Eve, Jean was gunned down when gangs opened fire on police, government officials and journalists gathered for the anticipated reopening of the General Hospital in downtown Port-au-Prince. Also killed were fellow journalist Marckendy Natoux, who worked for Voice of America in Haiti, and a Haitian police officer. At least seven other reporters were wounded in Haiti's worst attack on journalists in recent years.",
      "The attack prompted officials to remove the health minister and indefinitely suspend the reopening of the hospital. Police have continued to try to repel attacks from armed gangs in the downtown area around the facility.",
      "Journalists are demanding compensation from the government beyond the money families have received to bury the two reporters killed.",
      "Robest Dimanche, spokesman for the Online Media Collective, a group that defends the rights of online journalists in Haiti, said the government had invited journalists to the hospital\u2019s scheduled reopening but failed to create a safe space.",

      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- Nigerian troops killed 76 Islamic militants in the country's northeast during operations conducted in various parts of Borno state, the military said Thursday.",
      "The operations took place between Jan. 7 and Jan. 13, Nigerian army spokesperson Edward Buba said during a news conference in Abuja, Nigeria's capital. He added that the military also arrested 72 suspects and rescued eight hostages kidnapped by the militants.",
      "Buba did not provide details about the extremists' affiliation but the area of operations has long been plagued by attacks from the Boko Haram group and its breakaway faction that is loyal to the Islamic State group.",
      "The army spokesperson also did not specify if any members of the Nigerian military were killed during the operations.",
      "The announcement by Nigeria's military comes days after suspected Boko Haram militants killed at least 40 farmers in another part of Borno State.",
      "Boko Haram, Nigeria\u2019s homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. The conflict, now Africa\u2019s longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria\u2019s northern neighbors.",

      "Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are eager to leave miserable tent camps and return to their homes if a long-awaited ceasefire agreement halts the Israel-Hamas war, but many will find there is nothing left and no way to rebuild.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighborhoods in several cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins. Most hospitals no longer function.",
      "And it's unclear when \u2014 or even if \u2014 much will be rebuilt.",
      "The agreement for a phased ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas-led militants does not say who will govern Gaza after the war, or whether Israel and Egypt will lift a blockade limiting the movement of people and goods that they imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007.",
      "The United Nations says that it could take more than 350 years to rebuild if the blockade remains.",
      "The full extent of the damage will only be known when the fighting ends and inspectors have full access to the territory. The most heavily destroyed part of Gaza, in the north, has been sealed off and largely depopulated by Israeli forces in an operation that began in early October.",
      "Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage \u2014 nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022 \u2014 from just the first four months of the war.",
      "Israel blames the destruction on Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military has released photos and video footage showing that Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas, and often operated in and around homes, schools and mosques.",
      "Before anything can be rebuilt, the rubble must be removed \u2014 a staggering task in itself.",
      "The U.N. estimates that the war has littered Gaza with over 50 million tons of rubble \u2014 roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take over 15 years to clear the rubble away, and there is little open space in the narrow coastal territory that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.",
      "Carting the debris away will also be complicated by the fact that it contains huge amounts of unexploded ordnance and other harmful materials, as well as human remains. Gaza's Health Ministry says thousands of people killed in airstrikes are still buried under the rubble.",
      "The rubble clearance and eventual rebuilding of homes will require billions of dollars and the ability to bring construction materials and heavy equipment into the territory \u2014 neither of which are assured.",
      "The ceasefire agreement calls for a 3-5 year reconstruction project to begin in its final phase, after all the remaining 100 hostages have been released and Israeli troops have withdrawn from the territory.",
      "But getting to that point will require agreement on the second and most difficult phase of the agreement, which still must be negotiated. And even the first phase was in doubt on Thursday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office saying a last-minute dispute with Hamas was holding up Israeli approval.",
      "Even then, the ability to rebuild will depend on the blockade, which critics have long decried as a form of collective punishment. Israel says it is needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities, noting that cement and metal pipes can also be used for tunnels and rockets.",
      "Israel might be more inclined to lift the blockade if Hamas were no longer in power, but there are no plans for an alternative government.",
      "The United States and much of the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern the West Bank and Gaza with the support of Arab countries ahead of eventual statehood. But that's a nonstarter for Israel's government, which is opposed to a Palestinian state and has ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed authority.",
      "International donors are unlikely to invest in an ungoverned territory that has seen five wars in less than two decades, which means the sprawling tent camps along the coast could become a permanent feature of life in Gaza.",

      "For decades, the Syrian-Israeli border remained largely quiet under a 1974 Disengagement Agreement, which established a U.N.-patrolled demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries after a war they fought the year before.",
      "However, after Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s ouster on Dec. 8, Israeli forces entered the buffer zone, calling it a temporary move to block hostile forces. The move drew criticism and protests from local residents and Arab countries.",

Israeli foreces have also made incursions into areas outside the buffer zone, sparking protests.",
      "\"These areas belong to the Syrian people, not the regime, and we must defend our homeland. Israel must respect Syria\u2019s sovereignty just as they seek security for their own borders and homes,\u201d Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said in an interview broadcast Thursday with Turkish network TRT.",
      "He urged the international community to pressure Israel to withdraw from captured areas and called for respect for Syrian sovereignty.",

      "On Wednesday, an Israeli strike in the Ghadir al-Bustan village in Quneitra province killed three people and injured several others, according to local residents and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor.",
      "Those killed included a local municipal official and security personnel linked to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that led the lightning offensive against Assad and is now leading Syria\u2019s new administration.",
      "The Israeli military said that the strikes targeted vehicles carrying weapons. HTS has not officially commented on the attack.",
      "Nizar Mchel, a teacher from Ghadir al-Bustan, said the military and security forces of the new government had launched a campaign to confiscate unauthorized weapons.",
      "He said Israeli drones targeted a convoy of military vehicles involved in the operation, as they drove north of the village.",

      "\u201cI was having lunch with friends, including Kouma, before he left to go to his house,\" Kouma\u2019s cousin, Abed al-Rahman al-Bustani, told The Associated Press.

      "\u201cKouma didn\u2019t work, but everyone loved him. He was a good man,\u201d Bustani added. He noted that at least three others were wounded in the strike. An Associated Press journalist visited one of the wounded members of the security forces in a local hospital.",

They have destroyed our houses, drones are constantly overhead, and we don\u2019t dare leave our homes,\" Bustani said. \"We live 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from them.

      "In a statement to lawmakers, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government has also authorized what she called a \u201crapid audit\u201d of the \u201ccurrent scale and nature of gang-based exploitation across the country\u201d and make recommendations.",
      "The issue of so-called \u201cgrooming gangs,\" also called \u201crape gangs\" by some, has risen up the political agenda in the U.K. after Musk recently took to his X platform highlighting the problem and condemning British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk criticized Starmer for not backing a national inquiry into the matter following a request from the local authority in the northern English town of Oldham, where police found girls under 18 were sexually exploited by groups of men in the 2000s and 2010s. Musk also alleged that Starmer failed to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s chief prosecutor between 2008 and 2013, a charge that the prime minister vigorously denied.",
      "Because the cases in Oldham and similar ones in several other towns involved predominantly white girls abused by men largely from Pakistani backgrounds, the issue has been used by far-right activists to link child sexual abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the crimes out of a fear of appearing racist.",
      "The decision to back a local inquiry in Oldham and four other areas is a shift in the government's position. It had previously indicated that there was no need for further investigations following a string of previous inquiries, both local and national.",
      "\u201cI hope this is a proper investigation,\u201d Musk said on X in response to the government\u2019s decision.",
      "A seven-year inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, but many of the 20 recommendations it made in 2022 \u2014 including compensation for abuse victims \u2014 have yet to be implemented.",
      "Cooper confirmed Thursday that the government will act on them as soon as possible, adding that \u201cmuch valuable time has already been lost\u201d since the final report was published, \u201ccausing even more trauma to many victims and survivors.\u201d",
      "Cooper said the government will provide 10 million pounds ($12.5 million) to support its announcement, half of which will go to the inquiries.",
      "\u201cAs we have seen, effective local inquiries can delve into far more local detail and deliver more locally relevant answers, and change, than a lengthy nationwide inquiry can provide,\" she said.",
      "The main opposition Conservative Party said Cooper's measures aren't sufficient as there are around 50 areas that have suffered from grooming gangs. It also voiced worries that the local inquires won't be able to summon witnesses, something a national inquiry would have been able to."

      "Brunner, an Austrian conservative who took up the post late last year, has previously spoken about a need to bolster EU policy on deportations, a controversial issue within the bloc\u2019s 27 member nations. EU lawmakers last year approved a major overhaul of migration laws collectively known as the Pact on Migration and Asylum.",
      "\u201cThere are some things to do, of course, some things ahead of us. Implementing the Pact is one of them,\u201d Brunner told Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the start of their meeting. \u201cBut the topic of returns also is something we have to deliver, definitely. And we will deliver, hopefully. I\u2019m still optimistic even though I just started.\u201d",

      "\u201cGreece is a country that has found itself on the forefront of the migration crisis for many, many years,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the progress that has been made at the European level in terms of a rebalancing of our overall European migration policy towards the protection of the external borders, with significant emphasis on returns, but also by placing a lot of focus on legal pathways to migration.\u201d",
      "Brunner was also meeting with Greece's ministers for migration, maritime affairs and foreign affairs, ahead of travelling to Cyprus for meetings with officials there on Friday.",
      "Brunner\u2019s visit to Athens comes days after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Human Rights found that Greece illegally deported a woman back to neighboring Turkey, and described pushbacks as being systematic. The decision could impact how Europe handles migrants at its borders. Frontline EU member states receive financial support from Brussels to handle illegal migration.",
      "The court awarded damages of 20,000 euros ($21,000) to the woman, a Turkish national identified by her initials A.R.E., ruling she had been improperly expelled in 2019 after crossing into Greece, with no opportunity to make an asylum claim.",

      "Greece registered more than 60,000 illegal arrivals of migrants last year, an increase of nearly 50% from 2023. It seeks direct funding from the EU to pay for the planned expansion of a border wall along the land frontier with Turkey."

      "WASHINGTON -- Few Democrats found ways to negotiate with Republicans quite like Shalanda Young \u2014 whose work as White House budget director stopped several potential economic crises from erupting.",
      "She brokered a 2023 deal to stop the government from defaulting on its debt. She worked to keep the government from shutting down, preserve disaster relief and address a baby formula shortage. She helped save aid to Ukraine with a loan based on frozen Russian assets.",
      "Young may have been the most powerful low-profile person in the Biden administration. And while President Joe Biden leaves office with a dismal approval rating and a mixed legacy, she departs as the director of the Office of Management and Budget with a record with more wins than losses.",
      "Her formula for success: a blend of understanding the arcana of federal spending, reading the politics of the moment, and convincing reluctant lawmakers that compromise was in their interest.",
      "\u201cShe was an enormous challenge to negotiate with because of her skills, her intelligence and her wicked sense of humor,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. \u201cI mean that as the highest of compliments.\u201d",
      "Sitting on a couch in her high-ceilinged office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Young attributed her success to \"giving Republicans who want to do the right thing the political space to do that.\u201d",
      "Now, the incoming Trump administration will face some of the same vexing issues: raising the debt limit, preparing a budget and figuring out how to extend roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts set to expire after this year while also taming a budget deficit expected to be $1.9 trillion.",
      "Trump has nominated his previous budget director Russell Vought to return to the post. With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, Vought won't necessarily need Young's nimble political skills. At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, he declined to say whether he would allow the remaining Ukraine aid to be spent in accordance with Congress' wishes.",
      "For their part, Democrats will no longer have Young as a deal broker. At 47, Young, whose judgment was honed by nearly 15 years as a House Appropriations Committee staffer, feels no need to sugarcoat the hard math.",
      "She figured out how to balance conflicting issues caused by the mix of challenging numbers and toxic partisanship. She also did it while juggling the challenge of being a single parent to her daughter, Charlie, 3 \u2014 meaning that her evening phone calls with lawmakers, cabinet officials and others often had the soundtrack of cooing and crying.",
      "\u201cTo talk to me is to know I have a child,\" Young said.",
      "She had decided to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments, believing that a woman could take the most high-powered of government jobs as well as handle the demanding work of parenthood.",
      "It meant a messy existence of little sleep, high-pressure phone calls and only four weeks of maternity leave.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a choice. I wanted the job and I wanted to at least have a shot at being a parent, and both had a high likelihood of failure,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose chaos.\u201d",
      "The process of parenthood also changed her. She wondered how parents with fewer resources could make it, and concluded that people working 40 hours a week ought to be able to afford decent child care and health care.",
      "Young sees much of her approach stemming from how she grew up in Clinton, Louisiana, where her grandmother came out of retirement to be her middle school basketball coach. She stressed to her that she needed to live as a role model would: \"You don\u2019t know what young girl is watching you. So you are always to be on your best behavior. Be a leader of this team.\"",
      "That guided how she drives a deal. She let lawmakers, colleagues and even the president be human. When she negotiated on Ukraine funding, she thought about visiting that country as a congressional staffer and her trip to a child center there, where she played with the kids.",
      "When negotiations were faltering in 2023 to raise the debt ceiling, she worried about a growing number of Republicans who seemed to view default as an acceptable risk. But she says there is still enough of a governing majority who understood the threat to the nation and their constituents.",
      "The talks had become a circus on Capitol Hill, with reporters chasing the negotiators, so she moved negotiations to the Office of Management and Budget conference room with its relative privacy on the White House campus. She said she needed to get the right Republicans, such as McHenry, in the room.",
      "After agreeing on top-line numbers, Republicans said they needed to be able to go to their fellow lawmakers with work requirements on people who receive food aid. Young agreed to their terms, knowing some would lose benefits.",
      "To ultimately settle the deal, Young needed to bring Biden back from a foreign trip in Asia. At their final meeting on a May Friday, Young felt confident she had a deal. But she needed to fly to New Orleans to deliver a commencement speech at Xavier University. Her final phone calls ended at 3 a.m. and she then spent Saturday morning on the phone with Biden going over the deal.",
      "\u201cI'm glad I went,\u201d she said of the speech, but then added with laughter, \u201cThat weekend almost killed me.\u201d",
      "For her part, Young admitted she was most nervous to present the deal to Democratic lawmakers, scared that they might tear her head off for the resulting compromise.",
      "Instead, she got a standing ovation from the room.",
      "\u201cI cried like a baby,\u201d she said.",
      "Young has a position lined up for life after the White House, but it hasn't been announced yet. She said she's looking forward to the idea of living with just one cellphone."

      "As he assumes the presidency for a second time, Donald Trump brings with him a broad expanse of business relationships and financial entanglements \u2014 and the possibility that those associations could influence his decision-making in the White House.",
      "Trump's team dismisses such concerns. \u201cPresident Trump removed himself from his multibillion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary, becoming the first President to actually lose net worth while serving in the White House,\u201d Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cUnlike most politicians, President Trump didn\u2019t get into politics for profit \u2014 he\u2019s fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\u201d",
      "But questions remain. Here's a look at the various connections and potential conflicts in Trump\u2019s second administration.",
      "Launched in 2021, Winning Team Publishing is run by Donald Trump Jr. and Sergio Gor, a Trump adviser selected by the president-elect to run the White House personnel office. Gor also led the pro-Trump super PAC Right for America.",
      "Trump has earned at least $11.6 million in royalties over the last two years from two of his books produced by Winning Team, according to financial disclosure statements filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.",
      "\u201cLetters to Trump\u201d is an anthology of correspondence from celebrities and politicians written to him over the years. \u201cOur Journey Together\u201d features hundreds of photos from his first presidential term with captions \u201chandpicked\u201d by Trump. Another coffee table book, \u201cSave America,\" features reminiscences from Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns and term in office, as well as a lengthy reflection about his brush with death during a July assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania.",
      "Campaign finance records show Trump\u2019s political fundraising committees have paid Winning Team Publishing more than $242,000 for unspecified books and printing services.",
      "The company also publishes titles written by Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk.",
      "Trump\u2019s name and image are branded on a dizzying array of merchandise that he promotes and profits from through licensing agreements, including Bibles, diamond-encrusted watches, gold-colored sneakers and guitars that cost as much as $10,000.",
      "Thousands of copies of the \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d Bible Trump sells were printed in China, a country he has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices. As president, Trump would be able to exempt Bibles and other religious texts from hefty tariffs he\u2019s threatened to impose on imported Chinese products.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of a line of guitars led to a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter from Nashville-based Gibson Guitars. A company representative said in a brief statement the design of the Trump guitars infringes upon Gibson\u2019s exclusive trademarks, particularly the body shape of the company\u2019s iconic Les Paul model.",
      "Judgments of more than half a billion dollars from civil lawsuits hang over Trump and will be more difficult to avoid than the criminal cases brought by the federal government and then abandoned after his election in November.",
      "A New York judge ordered Trump and his companies earlier this year to pay more than $450 million after ruling he had manipulated his net worth in financial statements to secure favorable loans. That penalty came shortly after Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for damaging her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault. A separate jury awarded Carroll $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "Trump has appealed the rulings in the fraud case and one of the Carroll cases. His latest financial disclosure list more than $101 million in liabilities stemming from the two cases.",
      "As president, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself for penalties imposed in civil cases unrelated to his official government duties, said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. And because the trials have already occurred, he\u2019ll have difficulty arguing the cases are an undue burden on his time.",
      "The constellation of high-end golf resorts Trump owns or manages generated hundreds of millions of dollars for him in 2024 and may pull in even greater sums once he\u2019s back in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump\u2019s financial disclosure reported close to $267 million in \u201cgolf-related\u201d income, with another $161 million in combined \u201cgolf and hotel\u201d proceeds from his Doral golf club in Miami.",
      "During his first term, Trump frequently promoted his golf courses and routinely played at them with a large, taxpayer-funded entourage in tow, leading to criticism that he was using the power of the presidency to enrich himself. Trump pushed to host the international Group of Seven summit at the Doral property in 2019. But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
      "The golf courses may also attract foreign officials and special interest groups hoping to gain access and curry favor by spending large sums at Trump properties.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s first term in office, the cost to join his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has soared to $1 million, allowing wealthy people to mix pleasure with politics and government business during his frequent visits to the club.",
      "While Trump collects income from Mar-a-Lago \u2014 $111 million over the last two years \u2014 he\u2019s been accused of charging the U.S. Secret Service \u201cexorbitant\u201d room rates of more than $800 per night for agents assigned to protect him when he traveled there and to other Trump family properties.",
      "Who Trump meets with while at Mar-a-Lago and what he discusses are largely hidden from public view. The Secret Service has no electronic systems to screen or monitor presidential visitors to the estate, according to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.",
      "Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "While he\u2019s since been reinstated to both, Trump has often used Truth Social for more personal commentary, leaving traffic on X and other platforms for more formal statements and pronouncements. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many users it has, so it\u2019s hard to know how broad Trump\u2019s reach there is.",
      "But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March. The incoming president has a majority stake in the company, and said shortly after his general election win that he had \u201cNO INTENTION OF SELLING\u201d his shares, which have significantly boosted Trump\u2019s net worth, and at that time were valued at around $3.5 billion.",
      "Trump has promised to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d as he returns to the White House, a promise that would likely pay off for him personally.",
      "Amidst the 2024 campaign, Trump launched a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies that he has promoted on the same social media accounts he used for his campaign. His two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also posted about their new platform, called World Liberty Financial, as has his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric and also serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.",
      "The new moneymaking venture could explode in value if Trump pushes through legislative and regulatory changes long sought by crypto advocates.",
      "During his first term, Trump said he was \u201cnot a fan\u201d of cryptocurrency but he has since taken a more favorable view \u2014 from announcing in May that the campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency to attending a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a Bitcoin \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d using the currency that the government currently holds.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people.",
      "China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and child birth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\"",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world\u2019s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will \u201cgrow old before it grows rich.\u201d",
      "Government inducements including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs have had only temporary effects.",
      "Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.",

      "China\u2019s population also is aging and declining, adding to pressures on growth. The government reported Friday that the population fell for a third straight year in 2024, to 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",

      "\u201cThe precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,\u201d Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment.",
      "\u201cThe economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China\u2019s access.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, including reducing banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing.",
      "National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year.",

      "Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand.",
      "Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy.",
      "Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem.",
      "\u201cChina needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,\u201d Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.\""

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",

      "The uptick in the cost of home loans reflects a rise in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price mortgages, specifically the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has climbed from 3.62% in mid-September to 4.61% as of midday Thursday.",

      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce.

Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects.

Last Friday the government reported that employers stepped up hiring in December and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.1%.",

Still, on Wednesday the Labor Department said that core prices \u2014 excluding the volatile food and energy categories \u2014 rose more slowly last month, as clothing prices barely increases and apartment rental costs climbed at a slower pace.",

      "The plan is designed partly to reinvigorate the company\u2019s flagging share price, which has fallen about 20% since last spring.",
      "BP also has pulled back from a number of renewable energy projects, and according to media reports, abandoned a previous plan to cut oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.",

      "La June Montgomery Tabron believes many Americans have a desire for racial healing. They just don\u2019t know how to start.",
      "\u201cIt may sound mysterious or challenging,\u201d said Montgomery Tabron, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation\u2019s first woman and first Black CEO. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually quite simple.\u201d",
      "It starts, she says, with a conversation \u2014 with the sharing of stories between people of different backgrounds so they can better understand each other. So when Montgomery Tabron set out to explain the foundation\u2019s \u201cTruth, Racial Healing & Transformation\u201d work and its creation of the annual National Day of Racial Healing, set for Jan. 21 this year, she realized she should do it by sharing her own story.",
      "That\u2019s what she does in a pair of books released earlier this month \u2014\u201cHow We Heal: A Journey Toward Truth, Racial Healing and Community Transformation from the Inside Out,\u201d a memoir tracing the steps from her Detroit childhood to leading one of philanthropy\u2019s most prestigious foundations, and \u201cOur Differences Make Us Stronger,\u201d a children\u2019s book about connecting with others outside our comfort zones.",
      "\u201cI wanted to use the methodology of healing that we use, which is through storytelling,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people relate through stories. And this became a book of very interconnected stories.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press recently spoke with Montgomery Tabron about her books and the Kellogg Foundation\u2019s racial healing work. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Yes. There were several places across our portfolio where we had the same reaction: Had it not been for the healing work, a situation could have escalated, particularly in Buffalo. Not only was that work about connecting people, it also was about affirming everyone as part of the process, affirming everyone\u2019s value. They felt it was a moment to show up in a very different way that honors healing. It was about the grounding in their humanity and using those principles of trust and mutual respect and shared understanding as a way to express their own grief and healing in that moment.",
      "It was a process. In many ways, it was cathartic because my own healing journey happened also during the writing of the book. I touched on moments in my life that I had not totally processed or really fully healed from. There\u2019s nothing like going through the healing journey that you\u2019re writing about. I think it brings a level of authenticity to the writing itself.",
      "It was, but that made it even more important for me to do so. I wish I had such a book at that stage of my life, so I\u2019m telling the story. But more importantly, I\u2019m sharing the power of healing with a very young audience that I believe will help them navigate the nation and the world.",
      "Teaching young people how to communicate across differences and showing them that it can result in strong relationships and shared understanding is the beginning of the work. It\u2019s work that, for those who practice, can lead to making connections and building strong and trusting relationships. I hope we also find that we (adults) can do it as well. It\u2019s not too late to have these conversations, and, particularly in this moment, is imperative that we have them.",
      "I think it is calling for this more than ever. When I think about the attacks on DEI, I attribute the attacks to a lack of understanding, a lack of shared purpose and an empathy gap. And what the book speaks about is exactly how those types of disagreements need to be reconciled and can be reconciled through a healing process and healing conversation. I believe that through dialogue we can come closer to understanding why there would be such an attack and have a conversation about whether there is shared faith underneath that would align us and take us to a different place, where you resolve the issue. So I look at that particular issue and say it needs a healing framework just as much as many of the most important conversations we\u2019re having in this nation right now.",
      "What we\u2019ve always hoped is for people to take action. And we hope that both books can be used as tools to show what action looks like. We want people to begin to not only hear and understand my story but see their story in the book and understand that part of this process is telling your story and having comfort in telling your truth, regardless of whether it may or may not align with someone else\u2019s story. We then want them to take collective action. What can we do together within our family, within our community, within our organization, across our friend groups? What can we do to help others and join in to help others see through conversation and dialogue that there are other pathways that maybe they haven\u2019t envisioned themselves?",

      "According to prepared testimony given to The Associated Press, Bessent will say the U.S. must secure vulnerable supply chains, levy sanctions to address national security concerns \u201cand critically, we must ensure that the U.S. dollar remains the world\u2019s reserve currency.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are set to question Bessent's stance on taxes, tariffs, trade and other issues during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Trump\u2019s choice for treasury secretary is a South Carolina billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore\u2019s presidential run.",
      "He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "Bessent was one of several people whom Trump considered for the role. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president\u2019s fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president\u2019s National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent will oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\u201cProductive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\u201d Bessent plans to say in his testimony.",

      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit."

    "story": [
      "It turns out that $1.8 billion wasn\u2019t just sitting in a bank account in South Carolina waiting to be spent",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- It turns out that $1.8 billion in South Carolina state funds weren't just sitting in a bank account waiting to be spent. Instead, it was an accounting error compounded over years instead of being reconciled, an independent forensic audit determined.",
      "The announcement Wednesday dashed ideas like returning the money to taxpayers or using the windfall on roads. But it also led to more questions: why wasn't the error reported when it was first discovered back around 2018, and should the elected state treasurer, Curtis Loftis, step down or be impeached.",
      "\"In the private sector, if anybody had made a blunder of $1.8 billion -- whether it was an error, negligence, misfeasance, malfeasance, fraud or a cover-up, they would lose their job,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Larry Grooms, who leads a committee investigating the accounting problems.",
      "The private audit, which cost millions of dollars, is the most comprehensive look so far into the South Carolina Treasurer and Comptroller General's Office. Those agencies are typically led by elected officials and are in charge of making sure that government accounts stay balanced.",
      "The audit isn't the final word on the matter. Investigators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, are trying to determine if it was just a series of mistakes or whether state employees figured out what was going on and tried to cover it up, Grooms said.",
      "Depending on how serious the allegations are, the state could see its rates to borrow money rise, pay fines or face other punishment.",
      "In a separate case, the elected Republican comptroller general \u2014 the state\u2019s top accountant \u2014 resigned in 2023 after his agency started double-posting the amount the state had sent to colleges and universities for a decade, leading to a different $3.5 billion error that also was all on paper.",
      "While Richard Eckstrom stepped aside in that case, Loftis has defended himself and his office.",
      "The problems with the $1.8 billion error started as the state changed computer systems in the 2010s. Grooms said the initial mistake happened when Loftis, whose job is to write checks for the state, shifted accounts from the old system to the new one.",
      "Loftis testified under oath before senators last year that he invested the money in the mystery $1.8 billion account and made nearly $200 million in interest for the state, which Grooms said seems impossible since there was no money there. The senator said Loftis also appears to have lied under oath when he said their was no federal investigation into his office.",
      "Loftis issued a statement Wednesday thanking the audit firm Alix Partners for its work. He did not address the statements from Grooms.",
      "\u201cThe citizens of South Carolina can be confident that their money is safe,\u201d Loftis said. \"We, along with our state partners, look forward to reviewing the report in its entirety.\u201d",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster said he has confidence in everyone going forward to handle the state's accounts and doesn't think there was any intention to deceive anyone.",
      "\u201cIt was an accounting error with no criminal conduct, no wrongful intent, no intent to make the error \u2014 errors sometimes happen and unfortunately, that was a big one,\u201d McMaster told reporters.",
      "Among other recommendations, the audit said South Carolina should hire a third-party auditor to look over the shoulders of the Treasurer and Comptroller General offices to make sure the state's accounting books are properly kept.",
      "The state has its own auditor, but that person is hired by a five-person board that includes both the treasurer and comptroller general. Lawmakers are likely to look into why that person didn't raise the alarm about the accounting problems sooner, Grooms said.",
      "Meetings have already been scheduled with a House subcommittee, and the Senate Finance Committee will likely call Loftis to testify by the end of the month, Grooms said.",
      "South Carolina has had a long history of accounting issues.",
      "The Treasurer\u2019s Office was created when the state\u2019s first constitution was written in 1776. Back then, the General Assembly selected the treasurer. But by the early 1800s, the state\u2019s finances were in \u201ca state of bewildering confusion\u201d and no one could \u201ctell the amounts of debts or of the credit of the State,\u201d according to History of South Carolina, a book edited in 1920 by Yates Snowden and Howard Cutler.",
      "The first comptroller general determined the state was owed about $750,000 in debts, which would be worth about $20 million today."

      "The lead budget writing committee to the Democratic-led Legislature proposed a $577 million increase to $10.8 billion for the fiscal year running from July 2025 to June 2026. A windfall in government income from petroleum production is slowing down though far from over in New Mexico, the nation\u2019s No. 2 oil-producing state.",
      "Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe said the spending plan leaves room for a separate proposal to create a $1 billion endowment and use investment earnings to expand mental health and addiction treatment services. That comes amid a proliferation of homeless encampments in cities large and small and related concerns about public safety. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has set crime and homelessness as a central focus for of the 60-day legislative session that begins Tuesday.",

      "Spending on K-12 public education would increase by $263 million, or 6%, to $4.7 billion. Additionally, the proposal sets aside $150 million for pilot programs to improve literacy, elementary school math proficiency and lagging attendance rates.",
      "Distributions from New Mexico's early childhood education trust \u2014 an endowment built on a windfall in state income from oil production \u2014 would increase by $290 million, or nearly 9%, to $854 million to expand childcare and related medical assistance.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is advocating for a slightly larger, 7% annual general fund spending increase. The Legislature develops its own competing spending plan, and Lujan Grisham can veto any and all provisions approved by legislators.",
      "The Legislature's budget recommendation includes an average 4% pay increase for public employees across state government, public schools and colleges.",
      "The budget proposals do not outline possible tax cuts or incentives. Republicans in the state House minority are advocating to eliminate personal income taxes that peak at 5.9% for top earners."

      "\u201cAirlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.\u201d",

Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The only thing Ravens coach John Harbaugh figures is missing in preparation for Baltimore's divisional round playoff showdown in Buffalo is having the deep and resonant voice of late NFL Films broadcaster John Facenda serve as narrator",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Baltimore coach John Harbaugh has enjoyed the fortune of competing on the NFL\u2019s biggest stages to appreciate the setting and magnitude of what\u2019s on the line for the Ravens and Bills in Buffalo on Sunday.",
      "There's the quarterback matchup pitting arguably the NFL\u2019s two leading MVP candidates in Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen.",
      "These are two division champions with a combined 27 wins two steps from a Super Bowl berth.",
      "Even the forecast of frigid conditions \u2014 temperatures are expected to dip below 10 Fahrenheit (minus-12 Celsius) \u2014 enters the equation as the third-seeded Ravens (13-5) travel to face the Bills (14-4) in the divisional playoff round.",
      "\u201cI can just kind of picture John Facenda coming down from the heavens and narrating the preview to the game,\u201d Harbaugh said, referring to the late NFL Films narrator whose deep, resonant voice brought gravitas to the league\u2019s classic showdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be a part of a game like this.\u201d",
      "The quarterback matchup alone is worthy of the weeklong hype and prime-time setting involving two dual threats, both selected in the first round of the 2018 draft, and the focus of a high-pitched debate over who is more valuable to their respective team.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why you play this game to be in moments like these,\u201d said Allen, before playing down the individual aspect of facing Jackson. \u201cIn the history of football, I\u2019ve never really played against another quarterback.\u201d",
      "The 28-year-old Allen topped 40 combined touchdowns for a fifth consecutive year while overseeing an offense that was the NFL\u2019s first to score 30 touchdowns both passing and rushing.",
      "The 28-year-old Jackson, similarly, refused to make it personal.",
      "\u201cExcuse me for everybody watching, but I really don\u2019t care who\u2019s watching,\u201d Jackson said of facing Allen. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care how people feel about it. We\u2019re trying to go in there and just win.\u201d",
      "Jackson combined for a career-best 45 touchdowns, led the league in numerous passing categories while running an offense that was the NFL\u2019s first to top 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 yards rushing.",
      "What still sticks with Jackson is how his last visit to Buffalo ended in a 17-3 loss in the 2020 divisional round, with Taron Johnson sealing the win with a 101-yard interception return.",
      "\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that.\u201d",

      "The Bills are challenged in finding a way to slow Derrick Henry, who had a season-best 199 yards rushing against them in September, including an 87-yard touchdown run on the Ravens first offensive snap.",
      "\"I think we\u2019re a lot better,\u201d said Johnson, one of three Bills defensive starters who are set to play after being sidelined against Baltimore in September. \u201cThis it\u2019s a new day. Things are just going to be different. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d",
      "The Ravens' test is understanding how Buffalo's offense has adapted while gaining a more balanced identity.",
      "Running back James Cook matched Henry with 16 TD runs this season \u2014 13 of them after Week 5. Buffalo also features the addition of receiver Amari Cooper, who was acquired in a trade in mid-October and provides another weapon to a passing attack that had 13 players with a touchdown catch.",
      "\u201cWe are obviously two very different teams than we were whenever that game was,\u201d Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton said. \u201cThe biggest thing we take away from that is that it can be done, we just have to replicate that success. But I know Buffalo has a sour taste in their mouth about that game.\u201d",
      "Sour, indeed.",
      "Defensive tackle DaQuan Jones immediately turned his attention to facing Baltimore after Buffalo\u2019s 31-7 wild-card win over Denver on Sunday.",

      "The Ravens continue to raise the bar for their running game, which set a regular-season record with 5.76 yards per attempt. The previous mark lasted six decades after the 1963 Browns averaged 5.74.",
      "In eight career playoff games, Henry has surpassed 150 yards rushing four times. That\u2019s tied with Hall of Famer Terrell Davis for the most in NFL postseason history.",
      "These are two teams who have spent the previous four years playing second fiddle in the AFC to the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals.",
      "In that time, Buffalo has been eliminated by Kansas City three times and Cincinnati once. The Ravens' last two playoff losses came in the 2022 wild-card round against Cincinnati, and last year's conference championship game to Kansas City.",
      "Bills edge rusher Von Miller was inspired by linebacker Terrel Bernard citing Greek philosopher Heraclitus in discussing how the past doesn\u2019t repeat itself because the world is ever-changing.",

      "The blanket coverage of Smith by Texas is a big reason why wide receiver Carnell Tate finished with a career-high seven catches for a team-high 87 yards, and Emeka Egbuka hauled in five for 51 yards.",

      "Aaron Rodgers' playing future remains undecided, with the New York Jets quarterback focused on the lingering wildfires near his home in Southern California.",
      "Rodgers said during an appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Thursday that his house in the Malibu area is OK other than having dealt with a lack of power for several days. But he said many friends, including actor Miles Teller, have lost property during one of the most destructive natural disasters in the region.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with trying to protect my house out here,\" Rodgers said. \"My home is fine. I\u2019m not in the areas that have been affected, but it\u2019s been a weird time for so many that live down here. Friends of mine have lost houses. A number of friends in Palisades have lost their homes, a number of friends in Pasadena were affected, friends around Runyon Canyon.",
      "\u201cIt's been a tough time, for sure.\u201d",
      "The 41-year-old Rodgers completed his 20th NFL season in the Jets' win over Miami on Jan. 5. He had exit meetings the next day with owner Woody Johnson, vice chairman Christopher Johnson, team president Hymie Elhai and interim coach Jeff Ulbrich and then flew home Tuesday to Southern California, where \u201cthe whole sky was dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI got to the house and the wind's going absolutely nuts,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe gate was flying off the handles, and no power.\u201d",
      "Rodgers said before leaving, he had \u201ca lot of nice conversations\u201d with the team, which is currently interviewing candidates for its general manager and head coach vacancies. Rodgers has said he would consider after the season if he wants to continue playing and would also have to see if the Jets' new regime wants him to be part of the team moving forward if he does intend to return for a 21st season.",
      "Rodgers said he has been in \u201climited communication\u201d with the Jets' brass because of the wildfires, but reiterated he isn't close to making a decision on his playing future.",
      "\u201cI told them I\u2019m going to take some time,\u201d he said. \"They haven\u2019t even made a decision on a GM or a coach yet. Once that happens, then that\u2019ll take us to the next step, which will be a conversation, I\u2019m assuming with whoever that individual is. But this is a time when I\u2019m taking time for my body and my mind to clear things.",
      "\u201cObviously it\u2019s different because all that\u2019s going on in LA. And again, there\u2019s been incredible, incredible work done by all the firefighters out here. Things are actually looking up, which is great.\u201d",
      "Firefighters are still battling the two largest fires, which have killed 25 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures.",
      "\u201cA lot of the attention has gone to so many celebrities who lost their homes,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThere's some affluent areas in both Palisades and Malibu that got affected. But there's a lot of other people, just your great average Southern California folks who lost everything as well. And it's going to be tough to rebuild.\u201d",
      "The four-time MVP, who's the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets. But he would be due a $35 million option bonus before the regular season begins and count $23.5 million against the salary cap.",
      "If Rodgers is cut or retires, the Jets could absorb a $49 million dead money charge next year unless they designate him a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "\u201cI think everybody understands that it\u2019s going to come down to the GM and coach and myself,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201cand whether we all want to do the dance together or if it\u2019s not in the cards.\u201d",
      "He also said the situation in Southern California won't affect his decision on whether he wants to continue playing.",
      "\u201cListen, I\u2019ve sat in a hole in the ground in Nowheresville, Oregon, and I\u2019ve sat in numerous ayahuasca ceremony circles,\u201d Rodgers said with a smile, referring to some of his activities in previous offseasons. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve done a lot of contemplating in my time and I've gotten some good perspective adjustments over the years.",
      "\"This is nothing that changes my perspective other than it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 16:02:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington Commanders kicker Zane Gonzalez has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder his entire life",
    "story": [
      "Washington Commanders kicker Zane Gonzalez has lived with obsessive-compulsive disorder his entire life",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- A national television audience watched Zane Gonzalez adjust his socks on the sideline and fix his hair multiple times before putting his helmet on and taking the field to kick the winning field goal in an NFL playoff game Sunday night.",
      "Those watching did not see Gonzalez as a kid writing and rewriting papers and taking walks outside with his father or playing soccer to get his mind off homework he could not finish. Only his wife saw him set and reset his alarm clock about 100 times Wednesday night to make sure it was right.",
      "All of it stems from the obsessive-compulsive disorder Gonzalez has lived with his entire life, from childhood to now being a kicker for the Washington Commanders. Making the field goal to deliver the franchise's first postseason victory in nearly two decades has allowed Gonzalez to share his story, hear from others, correct any misconceptions and shed some light on what it is like to play professional football with OCD.",
      "\u201cAnybody that has OCD understands that mental battle\u2019s not easy,\u201d Gonzalez said after practice Thursday. \"You truly think it\u2019s the end of the world or whatever that situation is that you\u2019re going through that you think the worst possible situation can come of it. And even if it\u2019s the most unrealistic thing ever, that\u2019s just kind of the way you think about it sometimes.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who banked the kick off the right upright and through as time expired to beat Tampa Bay and send the Commanders to the next round at Detroit, feels he has gotten better at handling the uncontrollable, recurring thoughts and fears that come with the anxiety disorder. At 29, he is more confident and has been able to shrug off some of the social media attention that followed his viral moment.",
      "\u201cAs a kid you\u2019re more adamant about trying to hide it and trying not to show people,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cYou\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want people to think whatever, this or that.\u2019 I mean, you saw the reaction. People were always like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s nervous.\u2019 It\u2019s like, OK, it\u2019s not nervous. It\u2019s just kind of a tick-type deal. ... Being a professional athlete it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m in the big moment, big stage, do what you do, make the kick.'\u201d",
      "After he made the kick, Gonzalez's wife, Lizzy, posted a TikTok responding to people making fun of her husband's OCD. It came up on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d with the retired punter-turned-TV star talking about how much of the position was mental and how kickers develop routines to get in the right frame of mind.",
      "Gonzalez's pre-kick mannerisms are nothing new, and he said his wife and teammates have seen it plenty over the years at practices and in games.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen the hair-fixing and adjusting his shoe \u2014 I never thought anything of it,\u201d long snapper Tyler Ott said. \"But when he gets a minute on screen of leading up to the kick to send us to the first playoff win in 18, 19 years, it got some more attention.\u201d",
      "In recent days, Gonzalez, Ott and punter/holder Tress Way have made light of the hair-fixing, laughing about it after receiving an award in a team meeting and mimicking it during practice. Coach Dan Quinn knew about Gonzalez's OCD and said he was glad at this opportunity to make it a subject of proper discussion.",
      "\u201cIf that is a chance for him to assist one other person, I think that takes just a lot of courage and tells you a lot about who he is, not just as a ballplayer but as a man,\u201d Quinn said.",
      "Way, Washington's longest-tenured player who finally got to celebrate his first playoff win, has enjoyed every bit of teaming with Gonzalez, who he called \u201cabout as low maintenance as they come.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play with a guy like that and to be working with a guy like that,\u201d Way said. \u201cHe just trusts Tyler and I to get everything ready, and he has just a great attitude and a great mentality for it.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez is the fourth different kicker the Commanders have had this season and seventh since the spring. Now on his fourth organization after stints with Arizona, Cleveland and Carolina, he made 5 of 7 field-goal attempts and was 19 of 19 on extra points during the regular season before being perfect in the wild-card round to beat the Buccaneers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been great in terms of we\u2019ve had a lot of turnover at that position,\" special teams coordinator Larry Izzo said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely stabilized the position, and he\u2019s come in and done his job. We\u2019re really happy with him.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who has learned some tricks to handle his OCD and spoken to therapists about it, is happy to get this chance to explain what he can about how he's thinking and have whatever positive impact he can off the field, as well as on it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of people that walk through life dealing with struggles on a day-to-day (basis), and a lot of it\u2019s at home that people don\u2019t see, Gonzalez said. \"It\u2019s been pretty neat to see the community come together and just kind of helping you out a little bit.\u201d",

      "The athletic director at a mid-sized school that\u2019s making a splash this season has a modest proposal that might offer one way to tame what many say is a transfer-portal system run amok in college sports",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The athletic director at a mid-sized school that's making a splash this season has a modest proposal for taming what many say is a transfer-portal system run amok in college sports.",
      "Sean Frazier, the AD at Northern Illinois \u2014 remember, the team that beat national finalist Notre Dame earlier this season \u2014 is talking about a \u201ctalent acquisition fee.\"",
      "When schools sign players from other teams, they would pay those teams a fee in exchange for the player. It's not that different from the way transactions go down with what are known as \u201ctransfer fees\u201d in European soccer.",
      "It's an idea that Frazier, admittedly, is still sketching out on cocktail napkins. But he thinks it might help the small guys sustain their programs while adding transparency to deals involving some of the 11,000-plus football players across all divisions who enter the portal \u2014 the terms of some of those life-changing transactions themselves pecked out on cell phones in the middle of the night.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the kid deserves the compensation and support,\u201d Frazier said in an interview with The Associated Press at the NCAA convention this week. \u201cBut the institution, to keep the cycle going, they deserve something as well. We're not in the situation to continue to do that if we keep losing our best and brightest.\u201d",
      "Buoyed by that win over Notre Dame, and a steady string of success over the years, Frazier's school recently announced it was moving its football program from the Mid-American into the Mountain West Conference starting in 2026.",
      "The Mountain West, with champion Boise State in the College Football Playoff this season, is arguably the most formidable of the so-called Group of Five conferences. There are also 129 schools in the FCS \u2014 the Football Championship Subdivision that is the latest iteration of what used to be called Division I-AA.",
      "With the House Settlement set to reshape college sports, allowing institutions to pay players directly while also reshaping roster sizes across all sports, smaller schools like NIU have decisions to make. Namely, will they opt into the revenue-sharing agreements that allow the schools to directly pay the players for their name, image, likeness deals? Or will they stick with the model of having third-party collectives broker those deals?",
      "The schools have until March 1 to decide. Neither choice avoids the stark realities of the new college football: It's more expensive than it used to be, and big schools will always have the resources to draw in promising players who honed their skills at small schools.",
      "Frazier used the example of 285-pound defensive tackle Skyler Gill-Howard, who came to NIU as a walk-on, got better each year, had five sacks for the Huskies this season, then entered the transfer portal and will play his last year of eligibility at Texas Tech.",
      "\u201cHe did a wonderful job. Our coaching staff did a great job developing him,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cThe heartache of it is, he's gone. From the G5 perspective, we're fine with the developmental side of things. There's a certain level of respect there. But this could help institutions like us, where there's a flat fee, or dollar amount, that's a show of appreciation for the development of the game.\u201d",
      "Any plan like this would face roadblocks aplenty. First off, even though things have moved more quickly in recent years, college sports is traditionally glacial in making big changes.",
      "Secondly, as the recent takedowns of the NCAA in court that have led to today's changes have reiterated, the U.S. court system generally doesn't like things that restrict players' ability to make money.",
      "It happened to the NFL, too. In the 1970s, a judge declared illegal \u201cThe Rozelle Rule,\u201d a rule named after the late commissioner, Pete Rozelle. The rule is similar to Frazier's idea in that it allowed the league to award draft picks (and sometimes players) from teams that signed players with expired contracts to the teams those players left.",
      "In soccer, transfer fees have been the norm in Europe \u2014 teams essentially pay other teams for players instead of trading for them. It's an estimated $10 billion market, though a recent court ruling there could lead to anything from tweaks to a full-scale overhaul of that system.",
      "\u201cI'd see very little chance for something like that to happen,\" Gabe Feldman, a sports law expert at Tulane, said of Frazier's fee idea. \"There are lots of ideas out there, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll go into effect.\u201d",
      "Though the House Settlement brings college sports closer to a solution on how to pay players, the transfer portal remains a moving target.",
      "The leadup to this year's national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame brought with it stories of massive movement of players, including from the 12 teams that made the College Football Playoff.",
      "Among this season's biggest headline grabbers were the early season departure from UNLV of quarterback Matthew Sluka, who said promises to pay him $100,000 were not kept. Last year, former Florida QB signee Jaden Rashada sued Gators coach Billy Napier over an unpaid $13 million NIL deal. Rashada now plays at Georgia.",
      "More common are accusations of tampering that leads to programs standing by helplessly as players leave without much, if any, warning.",
      "\u201cI can't believe we live in a world where people are making decisions and issuing offers in text messages,\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker said. \u201cThe number of kids who have told me terrible stories about misrepresentation \u2014 there's no process, accountability, no transparency.\"",
      "Frazier, always in search of resources to recruit, develop and, now more frequently, replace players, doesn't necessarily see his \u201ctalent acquisition\u201d fee as a cure-all. But maybe, he says, it's a start.",
      "He points to the NFL, NBA and other pro leagues that have collective bargaining and drafts that set the framework for their sports.",
      "\u201cWe don't have that,\" he said. \"This is one of the guardrails that could get us to the point of acknowledging that, yes, you still can buy your team, but it shouldn't be the wild, wild west.\u201d",

Bob loved people; his presence warmed every room and he had a way of welcoming all of us into his world as if we were lifelong friends. Saying goodbye to Bob shakes us all. He was so much more than a Milwaukee Brewers icon. He was a national treasure. Bob entertained us with his words and storytelling, so it is no surprise that his passing now leaves us at a loss for our own words There is no describing the impact Ueck had on so many, and no words for how much he was loved. We are left with a giant void in our hearts, but also remember the laughter and joy he brought to our lives throughout the years.\u201d \u2014 Milwaukee Brewers",

      "\u201cI am heartbroken with the loss of my dear lifelong friend, Bob Uecker. I can\u2019t begin to describe how much he meant to me, let alone what this loss is for Brewers fans, the state of Wisconsin and countless others worldwide. Bob had the easiest way of making others feel at ease, share a laugh and always left people feeling a little better. Nobody was his equal. I am so grateful that Bob\u2019s friendship was a constant presence throughout most of my life. For over fifty years, rarely did a day pass where we missed a conversation, a sharing of stories, and countless laughs. That cannot be replaced and is a giant loss, but I am lucky to have experienced that kind of enduring friendship. Sue and I are thinking of Judy, Bob\u2019s children Sue Ann and Bob Jr., and all of Bob\u2019s family during what is a difficult time for all of us.\u201d \u2014 MLB Commissioner Emeritus and former Brewers owner Bud Selig",
      "___",
      "\u201cWhile this onetime backup catcher was known for his self-deprecating style, Bob Uecker was one of the game\u2019s most beloved figures throughout his 70-year career in baseball. In his six years in his hometown of Milwaukee as well as St. Louis, Philadelphia and Atlanta, Bob made lifelong friendships with many Hall of Famers and other stars of the \u201960s, and he was a member of the 1964 World Series Champion Cardinals. Near the beginning of his remarkable 54-year run in the Brewers\u2019 radio booth, Bob\u2019s trademark wit became a staple of television and movies. Even with his considerable success in Hollywood, Bob remained fiercely loyal to baseball and to Milwaukee. He loved the game and used his platform to help numerous charitable causes in his hometown and beyond.",
      "\u201cBob was the genuine item: always the funniest person in any room he was in, and always an outstanding ambassador for our National Pastime. We are grateful for this baseball life like no other, and we will never forget him.

To say you were one of one is probably an understatement, the stories you could tell, the life you lived and the way you impacted people. I always cherished our time together and just being able to listen to you talk about your life and all you\u2019d seen. I remember you saying that no matter how much time you have it still never feels like enough and that seems pretty true today. You\u2019d always thank me for my friendship but the truth of it is the pleasure was all mine. I\u2019ll miss you my friend.\u201d \u2014 Milwaukee Brewers outfielder and 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich",

In every low moment, there was no one whose arm around the shoulder and uplifting words meant more than Bob Uecker\u2019s. Today we lost an absolute legend and treasured human being.

Even with a walker and on pain meds, he was cracking jokes and making me laugh. I\u2019ll always treasure the memories from \u2018Mr. Belvedere\u2019 \u2014there were so many. Bob was the glue that held us together and kept us grounded. He never took anything too seriously, and his #1 goal was always to make us laugh.\u201d \u2014 Tracy (Wells) Tofte, who appeared alongside Uecker on the 1980s sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d",

      "The Indiana Fever are building a new practice facility set to open before the 2027 WNBA season, the franchise announced Thursday",
      "The Indiana Fever have had a revival with the additions of Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston over the last two seasons.",
      "Now the franchise, which made the playoffs last season for the first time since 2016, is building a new practice facility that's set to open before the 2027 WNBA season, the Fever announced Thursday.",
      "The $78 million performance center will be in downtown Indianapolis and connect to Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Fever play, via a skybridge.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to partner with Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett to identify the perfect location for the Indiana Fever Sports Performance Center,\u201d Pacers Sports and Entertainment owner Herb Simon said. \u201cThe city of Indianapolis continues to be a tremendous partner as we elevate our team, players and community.\u201d",
      "The Fever have had their own practice court and training area in Gainbridge Fieldhouse, where the Indiana Pacers also play. It was renovated in 2020.",
      "The new facility will have best-in-class amenities, including two regulation-sized courts with natural light, premier strength and conditioning equipment, yoga and Pilates area, hydration station and full-service kitchen. To help players recover and recharge, the facility will offer a spa-like retreat with massage, infrared light therapy, sauna, steam, heat studios, float tank and multiple hydrotherapy pools.",
      "\u201cIt's exciting. I was just saying how it\u2019s just a great opportunity,\u201d Boston said. \u201cYou look at our owners and how much they pour into us, it\u2019s super exciting to really have our own facility.\u201d",

Where can I go and get recovery? Where can I go and get a massage? It's going to be right there for us and we'll be the most recovered and be the most prepared for our games.

      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \u201cMr. Baseball\u201d and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died. He was 90.",
      "The team announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker\u2019s family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\u201cEven in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\u201d the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson\u2019s late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He\u2019d last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCareer highlights? I had two,\u201d he often joked. \u201cI got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\u201d",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker\u2019s initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers\u2019 most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker\u2019s broadcasts.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no single person in this franchise\u2019s history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\u201d said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers\u2019 broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\u201cTo be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people\u2019s families,\u201d Uecker once said. \u201cI know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That\u2019s part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\u201d",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\u201cI still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014 still think I should have gone in as a player,\u201d he quipped.",
      "\u201cUeck\u201d got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt\u2019s nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt\u2019s attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson\u2019s favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \u201cMr. Baseball.\u201d And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker\u2019s comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the \u201990s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom, \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m part of American folklore, I guess,\u201d Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\u201d",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014 \u201cJuuuust a bit outside!\u201d \u2014 in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker\u2019s acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren\u2019t, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\u201d Uecker said. \u201cI think people see \u2018Major League\u2019 and they think Harry Doyle and figure that\u2019s what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we\u2019ve got a good game going, I don\u2019t mess around.\u201d",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\u201cYou talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\u201d Selig said. \u201cAbove all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That\u2019s what he did. He\u2019s everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\u201d",
      "Uecker\u2019s own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\u201cI signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn\u2019t have that kind of dough,\u201d he said \u201cBut he eventually scraped it up.\u201d",
      "Another classic: \u201cWhen I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team\u2019s dugout and they were already in street clothes.\u201d",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers\u2019 new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \u201cUecker Seats\u201d high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker\u2019s honor. There\u2019s a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \u201cI must be in the front row!\u201d while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Danielle Collins has gotten into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Danielle Collins got into a back-and-forth with a booing crowd at the Australian Open after eliminating a local player on Thursday night, blowing kisses to the spectators and repeating the phrase, \u201cHow about that?!\u201d",
      "The 10th-seeded Collins, an American who was the runner-up to Australia's Ash Barty in the 2022 final, defeated Destanee Aiava 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2 across nearly 2 1/2 hours.",
      "That's when the fun began. First, the 31-year-old Collins \u2014 who originally planned to retire after last season but decided to return to the tour in 2025 \u2014 held her hand to her left ear and, looking into the stands at Kia Arena, said that three-word phrase a couple of times. Then, as the jeers grew louder, she began blowing kisses toward the fans.",
      "\u201cThe people that don't like you, and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. Obviously my professional career is not going to last forever,\u201d Collins said at her news conference, noting that anyone who \u201cbought a ticket to come out here and heckle me, it's all going toward the Danielle Collins Fund.\u201d",
      "She said she planned to spend some money on a \u201cfive-star vacation,\u201d and mentioned that she and her friends \u201clike boats; we like big boats; we like yachts.\u201d",
      "Earlier, when Collins began the customary post-match interview in the stadium, the noise from the seats kept coming and interrupted her first answer. So she paused and grinned, then said: \u201cI was thinking during the match ... as long as I'm out here, I might as well take that big fat check.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cThank you for coming out here and supporting us tonight.\u201d",
      "After speaking briefly about her next opponent \u2014 another American, No. 19 Madison Keys, who reached the final of the 2017 U.S. Open \u2014 Collins turned her attention back to the crowd and closed by saying, \u201cThanks, everyone. Thank you, guys. Love ya!\u201d",
      "Aiava is ranked only 195th and needed to go through qualifying rounds to earn a spot in the women's bracket. But she gave Collins a tough contest.",
      "\u201cI wasn't super surprised by how Destanee was playing,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI just had to ... do everything I can.\u201d",
      "Collins, who is from Florida and played college tennis at Virginia, famously got into a post-match spat with Iga Swiatek at the Paris Olympics last August.",
      "As for the acrimony out there on court with the paying customers on Thursday, Collins said: \u201cI loved it. I've been doing this my whole life. I love playing (in front of) a crowd that has energy, regardless of which side they're on. It kind of motivates me more.\u201d",

      "The Australian Open is getting in on the newest trend in the sports world by re-creating tennis matches in video-game form",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Maybe attending sports events in person is too been-there, done-that in the modern age. So, apparently, is watching the actual action on a TV, laptop or phone. The Australian Open is getting in on the newest trend in the sports world by re-creating tennis matches in video-game form.",
      "The year's first Grand Slam tournament, which runs through Jan. 26, is streaming real-time animated feeds on its YouTube channel that mimic what's happening in the three main stadiums.",
      "Players are represented by characters that look like something out of a Wii game \u2014 not exactly perfect portrayals of Coco Gauff or Novak Djokovic, perhaps, but the graphics do try to show the correct outfit colors or hats and bandanas the athletes are wearing and reflect what is happening in the matches, with about a one-point delay.",
      "\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a very accurate (depiction) of the actual player that\u2019s playing. So it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s funny and weird,\u201d said 2021 U.S. Open finalist Leylah Fernandez, who will face Gauff in the third round Friday. \u201cI did not see myself just yet. Maybe I will. Now I\u2019m curious, because I\u2019ve seen different players ... and I think I want to watch myself, too.\u201d",
      "Tennis Australia created its own \u201cskins\u201d to represent players, chair umpires and ball persons.",
      "\u201cThe wonderful part of it is it\u2019s the players\u2019 actual movement. It\u2019s the actual trajectory of the ball,\u201d Machar Reid, Tennis Australia\u2019s director of innovation, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the real into the unreal. That\u2019s part of the magic.\u201d",
      "Carlos Alcaraz, a four-time Grand Slam champion at age 21, called it \u201ca good alternative.\u201d",
      "Like many players preparing for future opponents, Fernandez often scours YouTube to try to find footage of past matches to aid with scouting. That, Fernandez said with a chuckle, is how she accidentally discovered the cartoonish replays from Melbourne Park that have been creating a buzz among the competitors.",
      "She was having trouble finding a certain match when she noticed a thumbnail photo of two players, Fernandez said.",
      "\u201cSo I click on it and think, \u2019This is it! Finally! I have one,'\u201d Fernandez said. \"Nope. It\u2019s a Wii character, which is hilarious.\u201d",
      "Jiri Lehecka, a Czech player seeded 24th in Australia, was checking social media the other day when he came across a \u201creplay\u201d of 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev's avatar destroying a net camera by smacking it repeatedly with his racket during a first-round victory.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that something like that exists, so for me, it was quite funny to see that,\u201d Lehecka said. \u201cMaybe I will see myself as a game character one day. We will see.\u201d",
      "To get the chance, he'll need to play a match in Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena or John Cain Arena. Tennis Australia first experimented with this on one court during last year's tournament, hoping to attract gamers and a younger audience to the sport.",
      "The NFL, NBA and NHL also have tried this type of approach, using animation for alternate game telecasts.",
      "The 2024 debut in Melbourne \u201cwas kind of in stealth and didn\u2019t necessarily capture the world\u2019s imagination. But this year, we\u2019ve seen that happening,\u201d Reid said.",
      "The streams in the first four days of the event this week drew more than 950,000 views, according to Tennis Australia; the figure for the same time period in 2024 was about 140,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of our DNA to innovate and try to challenge the status quo or, in this instance, provide experiences to different groups of fans that are more personalized for them to consume,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing younger kids or the gaming demographic gravitating to the sport maybe in this way. Clearly, it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d",
      "Might this eventually became the No. 1 way fans \u201cwatch\u201d sports?",
      "\u201cNot in my lifetime and not in yours, I don\u2019t think. But who knows? The world of sport and entertainment is moving so, so quickly,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re always going to be drawn to the amazing athletes doing their thing in front of our very eyes.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:06:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The Macuga sisters Sam, Lauren and Alli all compete in a different ski discipline and all three could very well make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter",
    "story": [
      "The Macuga sisters Sam, Lauren and Alli all compete in a different ski discipline and all three could very well make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter",
      "The conversations around the dinner table can sometimes turn spicy between the Macuga sisters when one particular topic gets brought up: Whose winter event is more demanding.",
      "The trio each make compelling cases. Alli, the moguls standout, touts the knee-jarring bumps and jumps; Lauren, the downhill ski racer, cites speeds in excess of 70 mph (112.6 kph) along an icy course; and Sam, the ski jumper, offers up soaring through the air after launching off a fear-inspiring jump.",
      "Mom and dad just soak it all in.",
      "\u201cWe get a kick out of listening to them argue over whose sport is harder or more entertaining,\u201d said their father, Dan, whose son, Daniel, also is an up-and-coming ski racer. \u201cThe banter between them is just fantastic.\u201d",
      "One thing these tight-knit sisters can agree on: Just how special it would be should all three make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter.",
      "Now that would be quite a family reunion. It\u2019s a real possibility, too. Alli, 21, had two World Cup podium finishes last season, while Sam, who turns 24 next month, is among the top American ski jumpers. Then there\u2019s Lauren, the 22-year-old who\u2019s coming off her first career World Cup win last weekend in Austria in the super-G.",
      "\u201cWe just watch all of them in awe,\u201d their father said.",
      "Each sibling was born in a different state \u2014 Sam in California, Lauren in Michigan, Alli in Washington and Daniel in Texas. Living in Dallas, an opportunity came around for the family to settle down in Park City, Utah.",
      "Amy and Dan jumped at the chance. Recreational skiers, they got their young kids involved through the Youth Sports Alliance, a program set up after the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics to encourage children to try different winter sports.",
      "Sam eventually gravitated toward ski jumping, where the elite jumpers sit on a bar about as high as a 40-story building until they glide down the runway and see how far they can fly.",
      "\u201cI remember Sam just said, \u2018Mom, dad, I\u2019m going to do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Lauren, who's competing in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, this weekend at the venue for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI think they just thought she was skiing over jumps. And then it turns out she was jumping these HUGE jumps.\u201d",
      "For Lauren, it was the thrill of speed that led her to ski racing (once she conquered the fear). This offered an early hint of her potential: She won a junior national event with a borrowed race suit and on a pair of skis where the bottom looked as if she'd just rolled across a gravel parking lot.",
      "In the case of Alli, she tried out a little bit of everything \u2014 aerials, slopestyle, halfpipe, big mountain \u2014 before being drawn into the world of moguls by the combination of bumps and flips.",
      "A side benefit to competing in different disciplines? No sibling rivalries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have my \u2018thing\u2019 and be able to tune in and cheer for my other siblings as they do theirs,\u201d Sam said. \u201cComparing experiences and stories is so cool.\u201d",
      "Of course, all of them think their event is the most challenging. None of them, though, really want to do the other\u2019s discipline.",
      "Alli on Sam's ski jumping: \u201cWhile the idea of literally flying sounds amazing, I\u2019ll stick with the smaller airs rather than sending myself down a giant hill.\u201d",
      "Sam on Alli and the moguls: \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a sport I\u2019m leaving to the professionals (Alli).\u201d",
      "Alli on Lauren and the downhill: \u201cProps to her for being able to go that fast down a hill and still be giggling in the finish.\u201d",
      "Lauren had plenty to smile about last Sunday in St. Anton, when she captured her first World Cup win. Her childhood idol, Lindsey Vonn, even came over to the leader\u2019s box and gave her a celebratory hug (Vonn took fourth). It meant the world to Lauren, who counts a slalom ski from Vonn (or so she's been told) as a prized possession.",
      "One of the best parts for Lauren was the call home to share the news of her victory. It was still early back in Utah and her father was sleeping.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Are you OK?\u2018\u201d Lauren said with a laugh. \u201cI was like, \u201cDad, I won!\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, Alli was getting ready to be taken to the airport by her mother.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it and rushed downstairs and we were both in shock,\" Alli said. \"It was so surreal to see her on the winner\u2019s chair.\u201d",
      "Sam was skiing in Norway with no cell service, but \"she called me the moment she had service and was like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d said Lauren, whose known for wearing bucket hats, of which she currently has around 26. \u201cIt was so fun.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to keep track of all their training and travel schedules. That\u2019s why their mom created the \u201cMacuga Calendar,\u201d a detailed, color-coded spreadsheet.",
      "This week, for instance, there\u2019s notations for Lauren racing in Cortina; Alli getting ready to travel to Waterville Valley in New Hampshire for a World Cup event; 19-year-old Daniel competing in a series of races at Mt. Bachelor in Oregon; and Sam preparing an event in Sapporo, Japan, where Amy and Dan were also heading. The calendar also features a \u201cnotes\u201d section to make sure their dogs are well taken care of while they're away.",
      "It\u2019s an invaluable tool.",
      "\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where they are, what country they\u2019re in most of the time,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos. I don\u2019t know how my mom does it.\"",
      "Should all three sisters make their Olympic teams, it will present another logistical challenge. Their disciplines spread out all over Italy, with moguls in Livigno, ski jumping in Predazzo and ski racing in Cortina. They\u2019re hours from each other.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll make it all work,\u201d Amy said. \u201cWe'll find a way.\u201d",

      "O\u2019Neil, who takes over for Greg Norman, was CEO of Merlin Entertainments who was in charge of business operations of more than 140 of the company\u2019s attractions. He previously was CEO of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, whose holdings include the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils.",
      "\u201cScott has the passion, the tenacity and the vision to continue leveraging LIV Golf\u2019s position as a preeminent, global sports and entertainment company and to lead our amazing teams and players for years to come,\u201d said Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and chairman of LIV Golf.",

      "LIV Golf begins its fourth season on Feb. 6 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The first U.S. event is April 4-6 at Trump Doral, a week before the Masters.",

      "Then it\u2019s Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills to cap the weekend.",
      "Three of the home teams are favorites by at least six points, according to Bet MGM Sportsbook.",
      "Line: Chiefs minus 8 1/2",
      "Kansas City\u2019s quest for a three-peat starts against the Texans, who are coming off an impressive 32-12 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. Stroud made big plays with his arm and even had a career-long 27-yard run that sparked the offense against Los Angeles. Houston\u2019s defense baffled Justin Herbert, forcing four interceptions, including a pair by All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley. If Stroud and the offense avoid turnovers and Joe Mixon has another 100-yard game rushing, the Texans can keep Mahomes off the field and have a chance to pull off the upset.",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans 27-19 in Week 16. They were home for that one, too. Houston lost wide receiver Tank Dell to a knee injury on a touchdown catch in that game. Mahomes finished the season with 11 TDs and zero picks in his last six games. After sitting out in Week 18 and a bye, Mahomes and most of the starters have to avoid being rusty in their first game action in three weeks.",

      "CHIEFS: 27-17",
      "Line: Lions minus 9 1/2",
      "The Commanders keep finding ways to win late with five straight victories coming down to the final play. The victory in Tampa Bay was the franchise\u2019s first playoff win since 2006. Daniels connected often with Terry McLaurin and Dyami Brown, but Washington will need Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler to run more effectively to have a chance against Detroit. A defense that held Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers to their worst game in eight weeks has to step up against the most dynamic offense in the NFL.",
      "The Lions could get running back David Montgomery back to join Jahmyr Gibbs in an elite backfield. That should open things up even more for Jared Goff throwing to All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and other playmakers.",
      "Since the NFL expanded to 14 playoff teams with only two getting a bye, No. 1 seeds are 3-5 against the spread in the divisional round.",

      "The Rams used a dominant defensive effort to eliminate the Vikings, sacking Sam Darnold nine times in a 27-9 victory. Getting to Hurts won\u2019t be that easy behind an offensive line that features five guys who received All-Pro votes.",
      "Plus, the Eagles are going to run the ball often with Barkley, who set a franchise record with 255 yards rushing in a 37-20 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.",
      "Rams coach Sean McVay vs. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio should be a classic head-to-head matchup. Matthew Stafford had success throwing against Philly\u2019s No. 1 defense in the previous meeting. He connected with Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp 17 times for 177 of his 243 yards passing.",
      "The Rams have to travel cross-country and have one less day of rest following a Monday night win. But McVay is 16-7 against the spread on short rest, going 7-1 ATS in his past eight games. With Stafford at quarterback, McVay is 8-2 ATS on short rest.",
      "Still, playing in Philadelphia in January is different and the Eagles are 6-0 straight up at home in the divisional round, covering the spread in five of those games.",
      "BEST BET: EAGLES: 29-17",
      "Line: Ravens minus 1",
      "Jackson vs. Allen gets all the hype but this isn\u2019t going to decide the NFL MVP. Votes were cast before the playoffs started. Jackson, who earned All-Pro honors, led Baltimore to a 28-14 win against Pittsburgh last week while Allen and the Bills routed Denver 31-7.",
      "The Ravens put a 35-10 beatdown on the Bills at home in Week 4. They\u2019re road favorites, a sign of disrespect for Buffalo. The Bills haven\u2019t been home underdogs in the playoffs since 1967 against the Chiefs.",

      "Hoping to become a two-way player in Major League Baseball just like Shohei Ohtani, 18-year-old Shotaro Morii made the rare decision to bypass Japanese professional baseball entirely and agreed Wednesday to a minor league contract with the Athletics that includes a signing bonus of $1,510,500.",
      "Top Japanese players traditionally have signed first with Nippon Professional Baseball clubs and established their professional credentials before moving to MLB as free agents or through the MLB-NPB posting process. Morii, a shortstop and right-handed pitcher, joined the A's directly from high school on the first day of the 2025 signing period.",
      "\u201cKeep following my dream to become a great player,\u201d Morii said through a translator during a Zoom news conference, wearing a gold A's jersey over a dress shirt, a green-and-gold club cap on his head. \u201cI didn't want to regret about my decision when I think about my whole life and whole career.\u201d",

      "\u201cI wanted to join to the professional baseball environment as soon as I can,\u201d Morii said.",
      "A left-handed hitter, Morii said he has been a two-way player since he was eight. He hit 45 home runs in three seasons while also pitching at Tokyo's TOHO Junior and Senior High School. He will start at the lowest minor league level in Mesa, Arizona, with the Arizona Complex League Athletics.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very talented baseball player with enough athleticism and mobility to play both shortstop and pitch,\u201d assistant general manager Dan Feinstein said. \u201cBut beyond his physical ability, the thing that jumped out at us the most is his passion for the game and his unwavering desire to be one of the next great players from Japan.\u201d",
      "Morii already was in the U.S. He will head home for a bit before reporting to the A's in March.",
      "Morii emphasized with teams he spoke with that he wanted to be a two-way player. His decision was yet another offseason move by the A's, who left Oakland and intend to play three seasons in West Sacramento, California, before moving to a planned ballpark in Las Vegas.",
      "Feinstein credited director of international scouting Steve Sharpe, Pacific Rim coordinator Adam Hislop and Japan scout Toshiyuki Tomizuka for helping reach the agreement.",
      "\u201cTommy, our scout in Japan, was able to watch a lot of their practices, his high school\u2019s practices and games last year, and then build a relationship with Shotaro and his family once MLB allowed us to do so,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cWe knew he had a strong desire to play in the States.\u201d",

      "The TCU women's basketball team had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because it didn\u2019t have enough healthy players",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- The TCU women had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because they didn't have enough healthy players.",
      "A year later, with Sedona Prince and Madison Conner both healthy and joined in the lineup by standout transfer Hailey Van Lith, the Horned Frogs (18-1) are a top-10 team and on a nine-game winning streak that includes their first 6-0 start in the Big 12 Conference.",
      "\u201cGone from the \u2018Underfrogs\u2019 and holding open tryouts to this week being ranked in the top 10 ... it's been a very magical ride,\u201d second-year TCU coach Mark Campbell said.",
      "TCU won its first 14 games in Campbell\u2019s debut last season, but Prince (broken finger) and Conner (MCL) got sidelined by injuries and senior point guard Jaden Owens sustained a season-ending knee injury within a couple of weeks after that school-record start. That left the Frogs with six available scholarship players, and two of them were on minutes restrictions coming off their own injuries.",
      "About 40 students then went through tryouts on campus the same week that TCU forfeited Big 12 games against Kansas State and Iowa State. Four of them were added to the roster before the season resumed with a 66-60 win at home last Jan. 23 over UCF, the same team the 10th-ranked Frogs beat 90-81 at home Tuesday night for their second nine-game winning streak this season.",
      "\u201cThe game that laid the foundation for TCU was a year ago when we played UCF here,\u201d Campbell said after the latest win over the Knights. \u201cToday was a really special game for our program, for the people that were a part of that game a year ago. There\u2019s a huge mural in our offices of pictures from that game that will be up there as long as I get to coach here.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-7 Prince had 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds against UCF this week. Van Lith scored 20 points while matching her career high with six 3-pointers and had seven assists without a turnover, while Conner made four 3s while scoring 14 points and having six assists. The Frogs had assists on 29 of their 32 made field goals and finished with 15 3-pointers, their most ever in a Big 12 game.",
      "TCU's current nine-game winning streak followed an 85-52 loss to reigning national champion South Carolina on Dec. 8. That came at the end of the first week that the Frogs had ever been in the top 10 \u2014 then at No. 9.",
      "\u201cThat game probably is going to be the biggest blessing of our season. Honestly, it taught me a lot personally, but I think our team a lot. Each person learned different things that were needed for the rest of the season,\u201d Prince, a former Oregon player, said this week. \u201cThis is the most fun group I\u2019ve ever played with in my entire college career, my entire probably basketball career in my life.\u201d",
      "The Frogs are seeking their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.",
      "The four walk-ons added to the roster after open tryouts on campus last January became known as the \u201cUnderfrogs.\u201d",
      "Sophomore guard Ella Hamlin from nearby Granbury, Texas, the only of those four still with the team, is now on a full scholarship. An emotional Campbell surprised Hamlin with that news in the locker room after the win over UCF on Tuesday night, the timing being specific and symbolic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. ... It\u2019s just amazing to look back and see like how far it\u2019s come,\u201d said Hamlin, who has played only 23 minutes while appearing in 10 games this season.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s the lone survivor,\" Campbell said. \"When adversity hits, most people avoid adversity, run away for adversity. The four \u2018Underfrogs', they showed up when we needed somebody.\u201d",
      "The Frogs play ranked teams in three of their next five games. They host No. 23 Utah on Friday night, which will be their first time in the AP Top 25 when hosting another ranked opponent since losing to Oklahoma State on Feb. 7, 2018.",
      "TCU next week goes to No. 24 Oklahoma State, then hosts Baylor and goes to Iowa State before a game on Feb. 5 at 11th-ranked Kansas State (17-1, 5-0), the only other Big 12 team without a conference loss.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life",
      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",

      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

    "story": [
      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Waltz made the comment when Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about a report from The Washington Post that said Trump was considering an executive order to suspend enforcement of a federal law that could ban the popular platform nationwide by Sunday.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",
      "Separately on Wednesday, Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, dodged a question during a Senate hearing on whether she\u2019d uphold a TikTok ban.",
      "Trump has reversed his position on the popular app, having tried to ban it during his first term in office over national security concerns. He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",

      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",
      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Last year in a U.S. Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",

      "Agency official Shigeki Aoki told reporters that aftershocks were possible, especially in the next two or three days.",
      "The quake, centered at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles), shook a wide area in Kyushu, JMA said.",
      "NHK footage showed moving traffic and well-lit streets, meaning that electric power was still working. No problems were detected at nuclear plants in the area.",

      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the ruling states. \"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"",
      "It continues, \"For the foregoing Per Curiam reasons, we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners\u2019 First Amendment rights. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.\"",
      "The court's ruling was unanimous, with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch writing concurring opinions.",
      "In an apparent effort to limit the implications of its ruling, the court said its judgment should not be interpreted as a rebuke of common practices taken up by social media companies, such as data collection.",
      "\"We emphasize the inherent narrowness of our holding,\" the unsigned ruling says. \"Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age. But TikTok\u2019s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government\u2019s national security concerns.\"",
      "Unless TikTok severs ties with China-based parent company ByteDance, the ban will take effect on Sunday, the day before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office.",
      "The Biden administration on Friday said it would not enforce the potential ban in the immediate aftermath of the deadline, leaving implementation of the law to Trump.",
      "\"TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said after the ruling.",

      "TikTok -- which boasts more than 170 million U.S. users -- challenged the sale-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, arguing that a potential ban would limit the free-expression rights of its users.",

      "Even after the ban takes effect, TikTok could remain available for U.S. users.",

      "But destruction at this scale will be no easy feat to clear or reconstruct, experts told ABC News. Challenges in debris cleanup, neighborhood planning and even the emotional health of the communities who were impacted by the fire could be prominent features of the rebuilding effort.",
      "The wildfires aren't even close to being contained. While winds began to die down on Thursday, offshore Santa Ana winds could return next week, bringing back dangerous fire conditions in an already charred region.",
      "While the desire to rebuild may be fervent, the logistics surrounding the placement of homes, what they're constructed of and the reality of living on potentially uninsurable land could hamper efforts, the experts said.",

      "Elsewhere, toxic byproducts created by the fire will seep into the earth and eventually get carried into the watershed by rain, Synolakis told ABC News.",
      "It will probably take months until communities have reliable drinking water again, Young said.",

      "\"We\u2019ve been building with very little consideration of fire for many decades,\" Barbato said. \"Rebuilding something that burned down is just not a good idea. If we rebuild exactly as we have and don\u2019t take proper measures, we can only expect the same results, or worse.\"",
      "Urban planning will be important going forward because a lot of the communities and where they were situated \"weren't safe to begin with\" when taking fire safety into consideration, Scott Stephens, professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley, told ABC News.",
      "For homes in the foothills, if a rare wind from the north gets blown down, that's \"basically a death trap\" for those homes, Hugh Safford, a research fire ecologist at the University of California, Davis, told ABC News.",
      "While California already has \"extremely good\" regulations in place for making new housing fire resistant, Synolakis estimates that 90% of the homes that burned down were built before those regulations went into effect, adding that all homes should be retrofitted to meet current building codes.",
      "\"Certainly in the lowlands or Palisades, some of the houses are close to 100 years old,\" he said, meaning they are made of wood frames and other extremely flammable materials.",
      "The University of California Los Angeles Climate & Wildlife Research Initiative recommended making homes more fire resistant and building new units in low wildfire risk zones in a quick-turn analysis released Tuesday.",
      "In an effort to quantify what contributed to the fire, the climate scientists found that while climate change could be responsible for roughly a quarter of the extreme vegetation dryness present when the Palisades and Eaton fires began, the fires would still have been extreme even without that moisture deficit.",
      "When rebuilding, everything should be built according to Chapter 7A of the California Building Code that is focused on wildfire urban interface construction, Barbato said.",
      "This includes stopping the use of wood for construction and using a noncombustible material instead; ensuring there are no holes are crevices were embers can accumulate; making sure windows have at least a double pane with glass that is tempered to fire, so that it doesn\u2019t shatter; and constructing roofs out of noncombustible materials, Barbato said.",
      "The psychological toll of rebuilding entire communities",
      "The link between psychological trauma and natural disasters has been well-documented.",
      "People who are impacted by natural disaster may feel a strong sense of grief, panic, loss, fear and sadness, according to the University of Houston's Department of Psychology. According to the American Psychiatric Association, the mental health consequences of single weather-related disasters for most people include mild stress and insomnia, high-risk coping behavior such as increased alcohol use and mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.",
      "Climate disasters bring \"crushing stress\" to physical, mental and emotional health, Lise Van Susteren, a general and forensic psychiatrist who has researched how climate change impacts mental health, told ABC News. The scale of the devastation in Los Angeles -- which has left once-vibrant communities resembling a war zone -- is sure to compound the trauma, Van Susteren said.",
      "As a coping mechanism, people's first line of defense is often a quest to rebuild, Van Susteren said, adding that it's a way to feel in control of the situation.",
      "\"Under stress, we don't do our best decision-making,\" she said. \"So we are already at a disadvantage.\"",
      "Conversely, there will be many who may not be able to handle the triggers of trying to bring back a community that once was or the possibility that a similar threat could wipe everything away again, Van Susteren said. The community may not be able to return to its former glory, especially if many of the residents leave for good. People may not be able to afford a rebuild, especially if it takes years.",
      "Places impacted by the Paradise Fire in 2018 or the Tubbs Fire in 2017 -- where whole neighborhoods burned down -- are still not back to normal, Sivas said.",
      "\"Just as there are climate tipping points, there are social tipping points,\" Van Susteren said.",

      "One of the structures destroyed by the fire was the home Erion and Stephan Taylor lived in with their three children. They say they only had 20 minutes to evacuate on Jan. 7.",
      "Tune into \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, Jan. 17, as ABC News and ABC owned stations kick off \"SoCal Strong\" (#SoCalStrong) coverage in support of Los Angeles-area communities amid the devastating wildfires. Coverage continues across ABC News programs and platforms.",
      "\"My heart dropped, I saw the flames, and I said 'Honey, come here for a second' and he looked out the door and his whole demeanor changed,\" Erion Taylor told ABC News.",
      "The Taylors quickly packed their most precious items -- wedding photos, loved ones' ashes, stuffed animals and soccer cleats -- into the car. They made their escape to Stephan\u2019s mother\u2019s home -- Peggy Taylor lives a 7-minute drive down the hill.",
      "However, the flames quickly threatened her home as well and the family fled. Since then, they have been living in a hotel room.",
      "\"The kids need a yard. They need a familiar space,\" Erion said. \"They need a kitchen table or a room to go to and shut the door if they want to be by themselves for a little bit.\"",
      "Erion said they\u2019re hurt over what they lost, but her focus remains on what they still have -- each other.",
      "\"I don't care about things at all. Everything can be replaced,\" she said. \"There's things I wish I had. I genuinely have everything I need right here. I have everything I need right here.\"",

      "Black families began moving to the area in the '30s, during the Great Migration, and Altadena became a multicultural haven in the '60s. This was a result of Black people being able to get mortgages and Altadena being free of \"redlining\" -- a practice that saw federally insured mortgages, loans and private residential insurance being withheld from non-white homeowners.",
      "Peggy Taylor, known as Ms. Peggy, moved to the area when she was 17. The home she bought in the '60s has housed both her boys and their families at some point or another, making it a haven for their family. Miraculously, that house was spared by the fire.",
      "\"To see it standing and there's no additional wind damage, doesn't look like it's been burglarized, makes me feel a lot better,\" Ms. Peggy told ABC News.",

      "A rare parade of planets will light up the night sky throughout January.",
      "Six planets will be in alignment for the rest of the month \u2013 four of which will be visible with the naked eye, Preston Dyches, public engagement specialist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and host of NASA's \"What's Up\" skywatching series, told ABC News.",
      "Venus and Saturn will be in conjunction, meaning they'll appear closest to each other, on Friday and Saturday, Dyches said. Both will be visible with the unaided eye in the first couple of hours after dark while looking west, according to Space.com.",
      "While looking south, a \"brilliant\" Jupiter will be shining brightly, Dyches said, while to the east will be Mars, appearing not quite as bright as Jupiter and more reddish in color.",
      "All four of these planets should be visible through the rest of the month, as long as light from the moon doesn't overwhelm the view, Dyches said. But the brightest phases of the moon have already passed for the month of January, meaning it's currently waning and will be in the third quarter on Tuesday and a new moon on Jan. 29.",
      "Two other planets will be visible with a telescope, Dyches said. Uranus is higher in the sky, next to Jupiter, and Neptune is to the west, just above Saturn and Venus, he said, adding that a self-guided telescope \u2013 that is, a telescope controlled by a computer \u2013 can help stargazers locate each planet.",
      "\"Uranus and Neptune, two very distant ice giant planets out in our solar system, are also there in the sky,\" Dyches said. \"But they are very faint.\"",
      "Anyone with a telescope will also benefit when viewing Saturn because its signature rings will be clear when magnified, according to Space.com.",
      "Conjunctions of three or more planets don't happen annually, like other celestial events such as meteor showers, Dyches said, noting that the sky has a \"cyclical nature\" due to the movement of stars and planets.",
      "Venus will be visible through April 1, according to Space.com. It will be brightest from Jan. 28 through Feb. 27 and will reach its greatest brilliancy on Feb. 14.",
      "Saturn will appear as a yellowish-white body with moderate brightness, according to Space.com. It will be within the boundaries of Aquarius for the rest of the year, and it will be visible with a telescope in the evenings until Feb. 23 and in the mornings from March 30 to Sept. 20. On Sept. 21, it will be visible in the evenings again.",
      "Jupiter will shine with a silver-white luster in the evenings until June 3 and in the mornings from July 16 to Dec. 31.",
      "Mars will also be in opposition for the rest of the month while it's visible, meaning it will be directly on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, something that happens roughly every two years. It's in the east as night falls and in the southwest at dawn, according to NASA.",

      "The price negotiations for the additional 15 drugs selected will be handled by the incoming Trump administration and, if deals are reached, almost assure billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers.",
      "Besides Ozempic and Wegovy, some of the other medications include Trelegy Ellipta, which treats asthma; Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug; and several that treat different forms of cancer.",
      "The list is a first step in negotiations and, given the timing, the details and final pricing will be left to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cFor some people this is a big deal,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a call with reporters on Thursday. \u201cSome folks have to skip a dose in their prescription so they can make a prescription last longer.\u201d",
      "That brings the total to 25 drugs that will have lower price tags for Medicare enrollees.",

A rule the Democratic Biden administration proposed \u2014 and the incoming Republican Trump administration will decide whether to implement \u2014 would cover the popular anti-obesity medications.",
      "The savings on the 25 drugs stem from a new law that allows Medicare to haggle over the price it pays on the most popular and expensive prescription drug scripts filled by older Americans. For years, Medicare had been legally prohibited from such dealmaking. The law, passed by Democrats and signed into law by President Joe Biden, was opposed by Republicans at the time, but it\u2019s unclear if they have an interest in trying to repeal or weaken the law now.",

Under the new deals, list prices were reduced by hundreds \u2014 in some cases, thousands \u2014 of dollars for 30-day supplies of popular drugs used by millions of people on Medicare. They included popular blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis and diabetes drugs Jardiance and Januvia. Drug company executives told investors during earnings calls that they did not expect the negotiations to impact their bottom line.",

      "\u201cFor too long, big drug companies have padded their profits by setting outrageous prices at the expense of American lives, forcing seniors to skip prescriptions they can\u2019t afford,\" AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said in a statement.",
      "The savings from the new list prices for those drugs were expected to generate about $6 billion for taxpayers and $1.5 billion for Medicare enrollees.",
      "Negotiated prices for the drugs don\u2019t kick in until 2026. But some Medicare enrollees should see relief from drug prices in a new rule this year that caps annual out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs to $2,000.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Army expects to meet its enlistment goals for 2025",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army expects to meet its enlistment goals for 2025, marking a dramatic turnaround for a service that has struggled for several years to bring in enough young people and has undergone a major overhaul of its recruiting programs.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army is on pace to bring in 61,000 young people by the end of the fiscal year in September and will have more than 20,000 additional young people signed up in the delayed entry program for 2026. It's the second straight year of meeting the goals.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s really remarkable is the first quarter contracts that we have signed are the highest rate in the last 10 years,\u201d Wormuth said. \u201cWe are going like gangbusters, which is terrific.\u201d",
      "Wormuth, who took over the Army four years ago as restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were devastating recruitment across the military, also flatly rejected suggestions that the Army is \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "Critics have used the term to describe what they call an over-emphasis on diversity and equity programs. Some Republicans have blamed \u201cwokeness\u201d for the recruiting struggles, a claim repeated by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, during his confirmation hearing this week.",
      "Wormuth dismissed the claims.",
      "\u201cConcerns about the Army being, quote, woke, have not been a significant issue in our recruiting crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t at the beginning of the crisis. They weren\u2019t in the middle of the crisis. They aren\u2019t now. The data does not show that young Americans don\u2019t want to join the Army because they think the army is woke \u2014 however they define that.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has vowed to remove \u201cwoke\u201d programs and officers from the military. And during his hearing Tuesday, he told senators that troops will rejoice as the Trump administration takes office and makes those changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s already been a surge since President Trump won the election.\"",
      "In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August 2024 \u2014 before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers.",
      "Instead, a significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army's decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training.",
      "In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool. About 24% of those recruits came out of the prep course. Wormuth said she expects it will contribute about 30% of this year's recruits.",
      "The Army and the military more broadly have struggled with recruiting for about a decade, as the unemployment rate shrank and competition grew from private companies able and willing to pay more and offer similar or better benefits.",
      "Just 23% of young adults are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use, gang ties or a criminal record. And the coronavirus pandemic shut down enlistment stations and in-person recruiting in schools and at public events that the military has long relied upon.",
      "Wormuth said a private survey along with more recent data show that the key impediments to joining the military are concerns \"about getting killed or getting hurt, leaving their friends and family, and having a perception that their careers will be on hold.\u201d",
      "That survey, done in 2022, found that \u201cwokeness\u201d was mentioned by just 5% of respondents.",
      "Wormuth acknowledged that the latest data show one element mentioned by Hegseth \u2014 that the number of white men enlisting is a bit lower. She said the persistent criticism about wokeness could be one reason.",

      "As an example, she said recruits get one hour of equal opportunity instruction in basic training and 95 hours of marksmanship.",
      "She also said there has been an increase in minority enlistment. The service brought in the highest number ever of Hispanic recruits in 2024 and saw a 6% increase in Black recruiting.",
      "In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000. The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, widely missing its publicly stated \u201cstretch goal\u201d of 65,000.",
      "The Navy and the Air Force all missed their recruitment targets in 2023, while the Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals.",
      "Critics have also charged that the military has lowered standards under President Joe Biden's administration. Asked if that was true for the Army, Wormuth said the service actually resolved not to do that to meet its recruiting goals. Instead, she said, the prep course helps recruits meet the standards.",
      "Other changes that have helped the recruiting turnaround, she said, include an overhaul of the system used to select recruiters, which now chooses soldiers more suited to the task, as well as an increased use of data analytics to improve marketing and ads.",
      "The Army also increased the number of medical personnel being used to help process routine waivers to move them more quickly through the system. A consistent complaint across the military has been that it took too long to get a waiver approved and that recruits were moving on to other jobs as a result of the delays.",

She arrived wearing a t-shirt that read \u201cPali\u201d \u2014 the nickname for her Pacific Palisades neighborhood \u2014 as signs and balloons of dolphins, her school\u2019s mascot, welcomed hundreds of displaced students.",
      "\u201cIt feels kind of like the first day of school,\u201d Gabriela said. She said she had been scared by the fires but that she was excited to reunite with her best friend and give her hamburger-themed friendship bracelets.",
      "Gabriela is among thousands of students whose schooling was turned upside down by wildfires that ravaged the city, destroying several schools and leaving many others in off-limits evacuation zones.",
      "Educators across the city are scrambling to find new locations for their students, develop ways to keep up learning, and return a sense of normalcy as the city grieves at least 27 deaths and thousands of destroyed homes from blazes that scorched 63 square miles (163 square kilometers) of land.",
      "Gabriela and 400 other students from her school, Palisades Charter Elementary School, started classes temporarily Wednesday at Brentwood Science Magnet, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) away. Her school and another decimated Palisades elementary campus may take more than two years to rebuild, Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said.",
      "Students from seven other LAUSD campuses in evacuation zones are also temporarily relocating to other schools.",

      "A total of 850 students attend her school and a sister school in Altadena, Odyssey Charter School-North, which emerged undamaged but is still expected to remain closed for months. At least 40% of the students lost their homes in the fire, she said, making it especially urgent for their well-being to find new space and resume school as soon as possible. \u201cAt this point we are trying to reopen in-person the very first day that we can,\u201d she said.",

The physical and mental health impacts put them at greater risk of learning loss: Absences can undermine achievement, as can the effects of trauma on brain function.",

Nestled between Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, \u201cPali High\u201d is the kind of California school that Hollywood puts on the big screen and has been featured in productions including the 1976 horror movie \u201cCarrie\u201d and the TV series \u201cTeen Wolf.\u201d",
      "Most of the buildings are still standing, but about 40% of the campus was damaged, officials said.

The school delayed the start of the second semester until Tuesday and will temporarily revert to online learning.",

      "The Louisiana State Police for years have used excessive force during arrests and vehicle pursuits, a statewide pattern of misconduct that places the public at \u201cserious risk of harm,\u201d according to a scathing report released Thursday by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "A broad civil rights inquiry, announced in 2022 following an Associated Press investigation, found troopers' use of stun guns \u201cparticularly concerning,\u201d and that troopers have used force on people who \u201cdo not pose a threat or a flight risk,\" often because they are restrained. It cited \u201csystemic failures in supervision\u201d and \u201cchronic underreporting of force.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also found that troopers use excessive force to immediately control encounters, often within the first few moments of encountering a person and without giving the person a warning or an opportunity to comply,\u201d the report said. \u201cAdditionally, LSP uses excessive force on people who run from troopers, even when that person is only suspected of a misdemeanor.\u201d",
      "The findings were released two days after federal prosecutors said they would not bring charges in the deadly 2019 arrest of Black motorist Ronald Greene, ending a lengthy probe into the white state troopers who stunned, punched and dragged Greene on a roadside following a high-speed chase outside Monroe, Louisiana.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, blasted the report as an attempt \u201cto diminish the service and exceptionality of LSP.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not let that happen,\u201d Landry said in a statement. \u201cThe reputation of our men and women in blue is one of respect, admiration and appreciation, and we will always have their back.\u201d",

Robert Hodges, the state police superintendent, told troopers in an internal email obtained by AP that the \u201cisolated incidents\u201d highlighted in the report \u201care not a fair assessment of today\u2019s Louisiana State Police or our agency\u2019s incredibly proud history and culture.\u201d",
      "The \u201cpattern-or-practice\u201d inquiry followed AP reporting that found Greene\u2019s arrest was among at least a dozen cases in which state troopers and their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct in the agency. In one case, a white trooper pummeled a Black man 18 times with a flashlight following a traffic stop, leaving him with a broken jaw, broken ribs and a gash to his head.",
      "The state police withheld body-camera footage of Greene's death for two years, but the AP published it in 2021. The video showed troopers swarming Greene even as he appeared to raise his hands, plead for mercy and wail, \u201cI\u2019m your brother! I\u2019m scared! I\u2019m scared!\u201d Troopers repeatedly jolted Greene with stun guns before he could even get out of the car, with one of them wrestling him to the ground, putting him in a chokehold and punching him in the face. Another called him a profanity.",
      "The 32-page report alleges that Greene's death \u201cdemonstrated serious failures\u201d that \u201cwere not isolated but part of a larger pattern or practice of law enforcement conduct that deprives people in Louisiana of their rights under the Constitution.\"",
      "The report cites one case in which a trooper \u201cslammed a bar patron to the ground\u201d merely for failing to provide his ID quickly enough. \"Rather than explaining the reason for the request or trying to persuade the man to cooperate,\" the report says, \"the trooper immediately grabbed the man\u2019s arm and forced him to the ground, injuring his nose.\"",
      "The Justice Department also examined whether state police engage in \u201cracially discriminatory policing\u201d but made no findings \u201cat this time\u201d as to whether that contributed to the misconduct.",
      "The report recommends \u2014 but does not mandate \u2014 a long list of remedial measures, while also crediting the agency with making \u201dmuch-needed reforms after video of Mr. Greene\u2019s death became public.\"",
      "\u201cMore reforms are needed to remedy the unlawful conduct we found,\" the report says."

    "story": [
      "It's one of the most enduring images of the Vietnam War \u2014 an Associated Press photograph of a young girl running naked down a street after being caught in a napalm attack",
      "It is one of the 20th century's most memorable images: a naked girl, screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question who took it \u2014 and the retired Associated Press photographer long credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera.",
      "The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d is scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it vigorously, and Ut's lawyer is seeking to block the premiere, threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own investigation over six months, concluded it has \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d",
      "The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam War.",
      "Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a 21-year-old staffer in AP's Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017.",
      "The film's allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film's investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the photographer and not the image's overall authenticity.",
      "The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode \u201ca scandal behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th century,\u201d at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model.",
      "It's difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called it \u201cearth-shattering.\"",
      "\u201cIt changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,\u201d Burnett said.",
      "The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his film to the AP's office as a \u201cstringer,\u201d a non-staff member who provides material to a news organization.",
      "The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his website, Knight described \u201cThe Stringer\u201d as \u201ca story that many in our profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great lengths to make sure isn\u2019t told.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,\u201c Knight wrote.",
      "Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, trying to stop the film's airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP declined.",
      "That hampered the AP's own investigation, along with the passage of time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed Ut's film, are both dead. Many of the Saigon bureau's records were lost when communists took over the city, including any dealings with \u201cthe stringer.\u201d Negatives of photos used back then are preserved in AP's corporate archives in New York, but they provided no insight for the investigation.",
      "Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and the details of the claim that it is making. \u201cAP stands prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might be needed if their thesis is proved true,\u201d the news organization said.",
      "The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang or AP's Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo.",
      "One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter, who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. \u201cI told them what my memory was and they didn't like it, but they just went ahead anyway,\u201d Butterfield told AP.",
      "Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later, according to the investigation.",
      "A key source for the story in \u201cThe Stringer\u201d is Carl Robinson, then a photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news organization from setting the record straight.",
      "Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday.",
      "On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut's picture could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war.",
      "The AP questioned Robinson's long silence in contradicting Ut's photo credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne toasting Ut's Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate archives, Robinson said he thought AP \u201ccreated a monster\u201d when it distributed the photo because much of the world's sympathies were focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly.",
      "Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image, said Robinson wrote to him after Faas' death in 2012 to make the allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett said Robinson told him that Ut had \u201cgone all Hollywood\u201d and he didn't like it.",
      "Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as \u201ca guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.\u201d He also questioned the long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the person who really took the photo.",
      "The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she wrote.",

      "Turner spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee as he seeks to become leader of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for President-elect Donald Trump. The hearing focused on how Turner would address housing affordability and homelessness, reform HUD\u2019s massive portfolio of housing subsidies, and tackle housing discrimination initiatives.",
      "It marked some of the former NFL player\u2019s most detailed comments to date on the nation\u2019s housing issues. Here\u2019s a look at the highlights.",
      "Though he ran the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump\u2019s first term, little was known about Turner\u2019s housing policy ideas before Thursday's hearing. He introduced himself as an underdog from Texas who came from a \u201cbroken\u201d family due to his parents\u2019 divorce.",
      "Turner also got personal when discussing the nation\u2019s homelessness crisis. He shared how he and his family helped his uncle, who was a homeless veteran.",
      "\u201cWhen they found him, my family and I were able to come around him, to love him, to take him in, to give him the wraparound services that he needed,\u201d Turner said.",
      "He also called out HUD\u2019s recent report acknowledging an 18.1% increase in homelessness in the U.S., with 770,000 people who were counted as homeless in 2024.",
      "\u201cHUD, if you will, is failing at its most basic mission,\" Turner said. \"And that has to come to an end.\u201d",
      "There were also many references to his professional football career, including his own quip that drew chuckles in the room about being drafted in the 7th round of the NFL, \u201cwhich is the last round for those that don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Turner was pressed for specifics on how he would reform HUD\u2019s massive portfolio of housing subsidies, with Democrats repeatedly asking if he supports Section 8 voucher programs.",
      "Turner didn\u2019t commit to increasing the number of vouchers, which is a longstanding priority for Democrats, but said he wanted to make it more efficient and less cumbersome for landlords who rent their units to voucher-holders.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona, implored Turner to protect U.S. citizens in HUD housing even if undocumented people were in their household. Only people legally in the country can receive HUD subsidies, though Trump\u2019s first administration had tried unsuccessfully to limit their eligibility if they live with people who may not have approved immigration status.",
      "Turner responded that he would uphold the laws on the books.",
      "\u201cWe do not like to tear up families, but we have an obligation to serve the American people,\u201d he said.",
      "Turner also said he supported tying work requirements to HUD housing programs.",
      "Turner, the only Black person being nominated to Trump's Cabinet, was also asked about his vision for HUD as the enforcer of the nation\u2019s fair housing laws.",
      "He committed to upholding fair housing laws, though he didn\u2019t address how he may change or gut Obama- and Biden-era initiatives to curb housing discrimination.",
      "He also sidestepped a question on how he\u2019d speak up in favor of fair housing policies if Trump seeks to weaken any protections.",
      "Turner was also asked how he\u2019d respond to Trump if there are significant budget cuts proposed for HUD.",
      "\u201cI do commit to having those conversations with the president and with Congress as it pertains to being an ambassador and a voice for HUD, and to maximize the budget that we are given,\u201d Turner said.",

      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won\u2019t...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to be the state's next U.S. senator, making her the second woman to represent Florida in the chamber",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody to be the state's next U.S. senator.",
      "The announcement comes after President-elect Donald Trump nominated U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida's senior senator since 2010, to be secretary of state.",
      "Five things to know about the Republican attorney general, who has served as the state's top law enforcement officer since 2019:",
      "Moody has spent her career in the justice system, working as a federal prosecutor before being elected at age 31 to the post of circuit judge in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. She ran for the statewide office of attorney general in 2018, the same year DeSantis won his first bid as governor.",
      "Moody comes from a well-known Tampa Bay family and followed in the footsteps of her father, U.S. District Judge James Moody.",
      "Serving in the Florida Cabinet, Moody has repeatedly advocated for law enforcement. Her husband, Justin Duralia, became a deputy police chief in Plant City in July. Previously, he worked at the Drug Enforcement Administration for 24 years, most recently as a supervisory special agent. Together, they have two sons, Brandon and Connor.",
      "Moody has earned a reputation as a defender of the president-elect, notably when she joined 16 other Republican state attorneys general in signing on to a lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win.",
      "\u201cThe integrity and resolution of the 2020 election is of paramount importance,\u201d Moody wrote in a statement at the time.",
      "In December, Moody\u2019s office obtained an arrest warrant for Ryan Wesley Routh, whom federal authorities accuse of trying to assassinate Trump at his West Palm Beach country club in September.",
      "Moody is pursuing criminal charges of attempted felony murder against Routh for a crash that seriously injured a 6-year-old girl after officials shut down traffic on Interstate 95 as they tried to apprehend the suspect.",
      "Moody is poised to become just the second woman to represent the state in the U.S. Senate, and the first in nearly 40 years; Republican Paula Hawkins served in the chamber from 1981-1987.",
      "In her first statements after DeSantis announced her appointment Thursday, Moody said her experiences as a woman would shape her work in the Senate.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, I am driven by the fact that I am a mother \u2014 and I still have a kid in school,\u201d Moody said.",
      "To date, 63 women have served in the Senate, with 25 currently in office.",
      "Moody\u2019s office unsuccessfully fought to disqualify two measures from appearing on the 2024 ballot: one that would have expanded abortion rights and another that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state.",
      "Moody accused supporters of the abortion proposal of waging a \u201cwar\u201d to protect the procedure. And she argued that the marijuana measure's language \u2014 that it \u201callows adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products\u201d \u2014 was misleading because it didn't clarify that marijuana possession is illegal under federal law.",
      "In April 2024, the Florida Supreme Court rejected Moody's arguments and allowed the marijuana and abortion measures to go before voters. While a majority of Floridians voted to pass the initiatives, both failed to meet the state\u2019s required 60% threshold to amend the constitution.",
      "Moody, who is a fifth generation Florida native from Plant City, was named the queen of the Florida Strawberry Festival in 1993. Plant City has hosted the famed celebration of the state's strawberry industry for nearly a century.",
      "Moody can claim another kind of Florida pedigree as well: She's a triple Gator, earning a bachelor's, a master's and a Juris Doctor from the University of Florida.",

    "summary": "Lee Zeldin, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, is promising to preserve a clean environment &ldquo;without suffocating the economy.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Lee Zeldin, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, is promising to preserve a clean environment \u201cwithout suffocating the economy.\u201d",
      "Lee Zeldin said Americans deserve a clean environment \u201cwithout suffocating the economy\u201d during his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a department likely to play a central role in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to slash federal regulations and promote oil and gas development.",
      "\u201cThe American people elected President Trump last November in part due to serious concerns about upward economic mobility,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cA big part of this will require building private sector collaboration to promote common sense, smart regulation.\u201d",
      "It was a mostly friendly hearing that occasionally grew pointed when Democrats questioned Zeldin about climate change asking what, if anything, Zeldin thinks should be done about a problem that has worsened floods and raised sea levels but that Trump has dismissed.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, for example, asked about basic climate science, including what impact carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels have on the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t sit before you as a scientist,\u201d Zeldin said. After a follow up question, he did say that carbon dioxide traps heat.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman serving part of Long Island, has been a longtime Trump ally. He served on Trump\u2019s defense team during his first impeachment and voted against certifying Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump led efforts to dismantle environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again. Experts and advocates believe that Zeldin\u2019s first tasks will be overturning President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashing pollution from power plants.",
      "During the hearing, however, Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska about whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Trump has criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged Republican opposition.",
      "\u201cI will tell you that I have heard concerns from you, and many others in this chamber, of how important it is to look at rules that are currently on the books,\u201d he said.",
      "He made it clear that he believed in strict limits on the EPA's regulatory power. He pledged to honor a Supreme Court decision from last year that weakened the federal government's ability to write strong regulations and fill in gaps in the law when those laws aren't clear. It was one of several blows to the EPA's regulatory authority in recent years \u2014 the justices also curtailed the EPA's power to write broad air and water protections.",
      "\u201cLaws are written by Congress and there are cases that have come out of the Supreme Court that provide the EPA with clear guidance on how we must do our job under the law,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Zeldin told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that Americans deserved safe water and clean air and promised to strike a more cooperative relationship with states \u2014 several Republican senators said they were tired of the Biden administration\u2019s heavy handed approach to enforcement.",
      "The League of Women voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin\u2019s lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy, manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin\u2019s record includes bright spots for environmentalists. He supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He\u2019s supported local conservation efforts, too.",
      "Soon after Trump picked Zeldin to run the agency, he was less reserved in his views, telling a Fox News interviewer that \u201cleft wing\u201d regulations hurt businesses.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest issues for so many Americans was the economy, and the president was talking about unleashing economic prosperity through the EPA,\u201d he said at the time.",

      "A Georgia state senator who was previously banned from the state House chamber has been arrested after he tried to enter the chamber for the governor\u2019s state of the state speech",
      "A Georgia state senator who was previously banned from the state House chamber was arrested Thursday when he tried to enter the chamber for the governor's state of the state speech and got into a shoving match with House employees.",
      "State Sen. Colton Moore, a Republican from Trenton, is among the chamber's most right-wing members. He signaled Wednesday that he would seek a showdown when he called House Speaker Jon Burns, a fellow Republican, a \u201ctyrant\u201d on social media.",
      "The arrest is one of several examples of state officials trying to restrain lawmakers or onlookers as legislative sessions begin in 2025.",
      "Burns banned Moore from the House chamber last year after Moore denounced late House Speaker David Ralston on a day when Ralston was being honored and his relatives were watching. In a speech, Moore called Ralston \u201cone of the most corrupt Georgia leaders we'll ever see\u201d over allegations that Ralston improperly delayed court cases he handled as a lawyer. Burns called Moore\u2019s remarks \u201cvile\u201d when he announced the ban, saying it would remain until Moore apologized.",
      "Before his arrest Thursday, Moore told reporters that Burns couldn't legally prevent him from attending a joint House-Senate session to listen to Gov. Brian Kemp in the House chamber. He said he met with Burns on Wednesday but couldn't work anything out.",
      "\u201cYou cannot impede a General Assembly session,\u201d Moore said as he tried to push his way past House staffers who were blocking the door. \u201cI have a constitutional obligation to attend.\u201d",
      "Keith Williams, a lawyer for the speaker's office, shoved Moore and the senator fell to the ground after one of Moore's attempts to enter the chamber. Troopers handcuffed Moore and took him to the Fulton County jail. There, online jail records show Moore was booked on misdemeanor charges of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers.",
      "Supporters said online that they were working to release Moore. Jail records said he needed to post $1,000 bail to be released.",
      "Moore was kicked out of the Senate Republican caucus in September 2023 after launching attacks on fellow Republicans for refusing to agree to a special session to act against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for indicting former President Donald Trump. Kemp denounced the call as \u201c some grifter scam \u201d to raise campaign contributions for Moore.",
      "In 2018, troopers arrested 15 people including Nikema Williams, then a Democratic state senator and now a member of Congress, for an election-related protest in the Georgia Capitol. Police arrested state Rep. Park Cannon in 2021 after she knocked on the door of the governor\u2019s office as he broadcast a speech.",
      "Charges were dropped both times."

      "An 84-year-old man who was killed in the California wildfires had immigrated to the U.S. from China in 1989, and loved his Altadena home and the California fresh air",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Shaw Zhao was worried even before he arrived in Los Angeles last week: His father's neighborhood was in an evacuation zone as deadly wildfires raged in the metropolitan area, and Zhao hadn't heard from the 84-year-old the previous night.",
      "As he made his way from the airport to Zhi-feng Zhao's home in the Altadena neighborhood on Jan. 8, he was stopped by police blockades. So he went to a shelter for evacuees, searching every bed for his father's familiar face to no avail.",
      "The next day, he got into the neighborhood on foot, walking for an hour with his Lyft driver and the man's wife \u2014 two strangers who had agreed to help him.",
      "Approaching his father\u2019s home, the houses along the entire block were all but gone. A coyote sniffed around the debris where his father's home once stood. When he went to inspect, he was horrified to find his father\u2019s remains.",
      "\u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d Zhao said, crying.",
      "Zhi-feng Zhao, who was among at least 25 people killed in one of the most destructive natural disasters in Southern California's history, had come to the United States from China in 1989, his son said, speaking partially in Mandarin.",
      "His father, who was orphaned as a child and grew up in poverty in China, earned a college degree in math and mechanical engineering. After he immigrated to the U.S., he was unable to continue his academic work in his field because of the language barrier and instead worked in the restaurant business, his son said.",

      "\u201cHe just loved the peace, the fresh air above Altadena,\u201d Zhao said of his father, noting that he was an avid hiker, active and strong until his wife passed away. He'd since required the help of a caregiver, who was out of town when the fires started.",
      "Numerous older photos of his parents, his mom's extensive stamp collection and sweaters she knit for him before she was diagnosed with cancer were also lost in the fire.",
      "His dad had told him, \u201cShaw, Mom will leave you. But you will always have something to warm your body.\u201d",

      "The Tennessee House is warning lawmakers and the crowds watching floor sessions that they could be booted from the room if their behavior is deemed out of line",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee House is warning lawmakers and the crowds watching legislative floor sessions that they could be booted from the room if their behavior is deemed out of line.",
      "For lawmakers, after multiple infractions they could be removed from the floor a few days at a time and forced to vote remotely. For the public, they could be banned up to two years for particularly bad or frequently disruptive behavior. The tougher punishment options came in a news rules package passed Thursday.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re on the House floor, and you\u2019re expected to have decorum and respect for the institution,\u201d Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters. \u201cSame thing in the gallery.\u201d",
      "The stiffer rules mark another instance in the U.S. where state lawmakers are focusing on punishments when they find their peers are misbehaving. The topic returned to the forefront Thursday in Georgia, when state Sen. Colton Moore, who had been previously banned from the House chamber, was arrested after a shoving match with House employees where the right-wing Republican fell to the floor trying to enter the chamber for the governor's state of the state.",
      "Rowdy crowds have drawn attention in legislatures elsewhere, too. In Rhode Island, the public was blocked from entering the rotunda on Wednesday for hours for Democratic Gov. Dan McKee's state of the state speech, including protesters calling for action on homelessness, according to news reports.",
      "Tennessee House Republicans have been tinkering with the rules to dissuade disruption from political opponents since 2023. That's when they expelled two Democratic lawmakers for a protest on the floor calling for gun control after a deadly school shooting. The move backfired politically, putting Tennessee in the national spotlight and elevating the Democratic representatives' profile with huge fundraising hauls. Yet Republicans kept the same supermajority after November.",
      "Rep. Gloria Johnson, the Democrat who survived the expulsion votes, called the Tennessee House changes \u201cthe most ridiculous, fascist rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are sending members to \u2018time out\u2019 for being \u2018out of order,\u2019\u201d Johnson posted on social media Thursday. \u201cRemember that to them, if you mention the word racism, they will call you out of order.\u201d",
      "The changes come as Speaker Sexton has become a top target of criticism from left-leaning Capitol visitors. In pushing the changes, House Republicans noted that Congress has strict decorum rules for gallery visitors. While both Tennessee chambers are controlled by Republicans, the House has long attracted the most bombastic conflicts \u2014 both among lawmakers, but also from the gallery. The Senate has not changed its rules or aimed to quiet lawmakers or visitors.",
      "On a few occasions, audience outcry has stalled House action after a contentious bill passed, and state troopers were ordered to clear the stands. It's not uncommon for some to unfurl signs or shout profanities during particularly fiery debates.",
      "In response, Republicans have sought to silence protesters they deem too unruly. In 2023, they banned visitors from carrying signs inside the Capitol and in hearing rooms during a brief special session. The rule was later challenged in court and paused by a judge, but lawmakers adjourned before the case was settled. They haven't reinstituted the ban.",
      "Last year, House GOP officials made half the public gallery require tickets. Each of the 99 House members would get one ticket to give to someone each day of the House session. The ticketed side holds 128 seats. The other has 120 seats and remains first-come, first-serve.",
      "The new remote-voting penalty for lawmakers is largely tailored to one of the expelled-and-returned lawmakers. On numerous occasions, Republicans have ruled Rep. Justin Jones' comments out-of-order and voted to temporarily silence him previously, at times saying he's talking out of turn, speaking ill of another lawmaker or veering off-topic. Jones has said the House speaker at times has ignored his requests to speak. Jones has also claimed a double standard in which Republicans aren't punished for comparable behavior.",
      "Sexton likened the rule to one in Montana, where Republicans voted in 2023 to temporarily silence and banish Rep. Zooey Zephyr to remote voting. The transgender Democrat said colleagues supporting a ban on gender-affirming care for youths would have \u201cblood\u201d on their hands.",
      "Also under the new rules package, gallery visitors who try to get the attention of someone on the floor, or whose actions are deemed by the House speaker to be detrimental to proceedings, will be removed and banned from returning that day or the next legislative day. If someone shows \u201cespecially egregious conduct\u201d or is repeatedly kicked out, they could be banned longer, up to a full two-year legislative term.",
      "Lawmakers, meanwhile, could be removed from the House floor and forced to vote remotely after being ruled out of order enough times on multiple days.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- North Carolina's Democratic Gov. Josh Stein unveiled new measures on Thursday that extend state protections for certain health care providers and patients' reproductive health data just a few days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Democratic governors \u2014 such as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's recent decision to stockpile abortion medication within the state \u2014 are taking renewed action to curb possible anti-abortion measures under Trump's administration. Trump\u2019s stance on abortion was largely inconsistent on the campaign trail and it\u2019s unclear what action he will take after taking office next week.",
      "\u201cI don't know what will happen, but what I am trying to communicate to the people of this state is that they have a champion in me for their personal privacy and their right to make their own health care decisions,\u201d Stein said at a news conference.",
      "Under the executive order, state Cabinet agencies are ordered not to cooperate with prosecution and penalties against health care providers who provided legal reproductive health services, including abortion.",
      "State agencies also must review and revise how they store data related to a patient's reproductive health to \u201cmaximize protections for individual privacy,\" according to the executive order. The state's health and human services department is charged with ensuring access to legal birth control and reproductive health care medication in North Carolina.",
      "Stein's action builds off a previous executive order from former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in 2022 shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Cooper's order offered protections from extradition to out-of-state abortion patients and barred state agencies from aiding other states' investigations into abortion patients traveling to North Carolina.",
      "Stein's actions further cement yearslong efforts by Democratic governors to offer sanctuary to those seeking abortions across the country. North Carolina is one of the only states in the South that doesn't restrict abortion access to six weeks or below.",
      "The GOP-dominated state legislature passed and overrode Cooper's veto of a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks in 2023. A federal judge struck down part of the law last year that required physicians to document the \u201cintrauterine location of a pregnancy\u201d before distributing medication abortion.",
      "Any further legislation on abortion will have a tougher time making its way through the legislature after Republicans lost their House supermajority in the 2024 general election. That also means Stein's veto should be more effective than his predecessor's."

At around 500 feet (152 meters) down, the person operating the elevator from the surface \u201cfelt something strange \" and stopped it, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell said at the time.",
      "The elevator was still operable, and those on board when the incident happened were brought back up within 20 minutes, he said. A door on the elevator was broken when it was raised.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the door malfunctioned or not or if something else occurred. There\u2019s a lot that goes on in these little elevators,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe just know that the door was broken somehow.\u201d",
      "Twelve adults from a second group were trapped at the bottom of the mine, 1,000 feet (305 meters) below ground, while engineers made sure the elevator could be used.",
      "Soon after the incident, Mikesell said Weier had died because of a problem with the elevator, not a medical problem.",
      "The case has been ruled an accident and has been closed, the sheriff\u2019s office said in its update. It did not explain what happened to Weier or how he died. He had a young child and was from the nearby town of Victor, Colorado.",
      "A spokesperson for the sheriff's office, Lt. Renee Bunting, declined to provide more details and told a reporter to file a records request to get more information.",
      "The mine, which was about to close for the season when the accident happened, will be able to reopen again for this year's tourist season, the sheriff's office said. State mining regulators had ordered the mine to remain closed and not conduct any tours until it could be determined whether the mine was in compliance with regulations.",
      "It is not known when the mine will reopen. The mine's website, which prominently features a photo of Weier and a link to a fundraiser for his son, still said it was closed indefinitely on Thursday and no one answered the telephone there."

      "The FBI is holding a news conference on the three ballot drop box fires seen in the Pacific Northwest during the 2024 election",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The FBI held a news conference Thursday on the three ballot drop box fires seen in Oregon and Washington state during the 2024 election that officials decried as an attack on democracy.",
      "On Oct. 28, about a week before Election Day, a ballot box in Portland, Oregon, and one in neighboring Vancouver, Washington state, were set on fire. The drop box fire in Vancouver \u2014 which was home to one of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country \u2014 damaged hundreds of ballots.",
      "A fire suppression system in the Portland drop box prevented most of the ballots from being scorched. Just three of the ballots inside were damaged.",
      "The ballot box in Vancouver also had a fire suppression system inside, but it failed to prevent hundreds of ballots from being damaged. Elections staff were able to identify nearly 500 damaged ballots retrieved from the box, according to the Clark County auditor\u2019s office.",
      "A previous drop box fire in Vancouver on Oct. 8 didn't damage any ballots. Vancouver, the biggest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, was the site of a competitive House race between Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, as she sought a second term, and Republican challenger Joe Kent.",
      "Authorities believe a male suspect that may have metalworking and welding experience was behind the three fires. They have described him as a white man, age 30 to 40, who is balding or has very short hair.",
      "The FBI has specifically asked for help identifying the suspect\u2019s car. Surveillance cameras captured images of a dark-colored, early 2003 to 2004 Volvo S-60 sedan, but at the time of the two most recent ballot box fires on Oct. 28 in Portland and Vancouver, it had a fraudulent temporary Washington license plate on the rear and no front plate, the bureau said.",
      "The Oct. 28 incendiary devices were marked with the message \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. A third device placed at a different drop box in Vancouver on Oct. 8 also carried the words \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in addition to \u201cFree Gaza,\u201d the official said.",
      "Authorities are trying to figure out whether the suspect actually had pro-Palestinian views or used the message to try to create confusion, the official said.",
      "The FBI has offered up to $25,000 as a reward for information about the suspect."

      "The sanctions that the Treasury Department announced against Sudanese Armed Forces leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and separate sanctions announced Thursday over North Korea's alleged forced labor for profit abroad, were among the last efforts by the outgoing Biden administration to use financial penalties to shape the behavior of foreign actors.",
      "The newly announced penalties follow U.S. sanctions imposed this month on Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, head of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and Burhan's adversary in a nearly 2-year-old war.",
      "Fighting between the forces of Burhan and Mousa exploded in the capital, Khartoum, in April 2023 and spread to other areas. The conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the U.N. and rights groups. Both sides are accused of blocking desperately needed aid to civilians.",
      "In all, the power struggle has killed more than than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have crossed into neighboring countries, including Chad, Egypt and South Sudan.",
      "Rising deaths from starvation have led to declarations of famine in five areas of Sudan.",
      "The International Criminal Court is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Ongoing U.S. sanctions are aimed at disrupting the flow of weapons into Sudan and holding combatants \u201cresponsible for their blatant disregard of civilian lives,\u201d the Treasury Department said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. also penalized one of the top arms procurers for Burhan's forces.",
      "Separately, the U.S. levied sanctions on members of networks accused of forcing thousands of North Korean internet-technology workers to work abroad to generate revenue for the government and military.",
      "The sanctions name a North Korean weapons-trading department, two front companies that the U.S. says it operates in Laos and the company leaders as well as a Chinese firm accused of supplying North Korea with electronic equipment."

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",
      "The latest IMF figures suggested the UK economy had weaker growth last year than the organisation had expected.",
      "Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves highlighted that the UK was the only G7 economy, apart from the US, to have its growth forecast upgraded for 2025.",
      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions.",
      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",
      "This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",
      "Its chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said \"tremendous uncertainty\" about Trump's future policies was already affecting stock markets around the world.",
      "On Thursday, the World Bank also warned that US tariffs could hit trade and depress global growth this year.",
      "The bank predicts global growth of 2.7% in 2025, which would be the weakest performance since 2019, aside from the sharp contraction seen at the height of the Covid pandemic."

      "Strict rules mean lenders have to be sure that people can repay mortgages, testing them for higher rates of interest.",
      "Other rules were also imposed on mortgage providers after the financial crisis almost 20 years ago exposed reckless lending and put major financial institutions at risk.",
      "The FCA points to current low numbers of borrowers missing repayments, or having homes repossessed, as evidence of questioning whether the rules are too strict.",
      "\"We will begin simplifying responsible lending and advice rules for mortgages, supporting home ownership and opening a discussion on the balance between access to lending and levels of defaults,\" the letter by FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi said.",
      "It will consider the balance between its primary objective of protecting consumers, and a secondary objective of promoting growth.",
      "If you can't see the calculator, click here.",
      "Same mistakes?",
      "Lenders have welcomed the move, but some analysts and borrowers may question whether lessons have been learnt from the crisis.",
      "Charles Roe, director of mortgages at UK Finance, which represents lenders, said: \"Reviewing the mortgage lending rules would help with affordability issues, not just for first time buyers but also those looking to move further up the housing ladder.",
      "\"Banks will always lend responsibly but the current rules are restricting the number of people who can get a mortgage and so could be relaxed.\"",
      "Analysts said the move could prove to be more beneficial in certain parts of the country.",
      "\"The big question is whether current rules go too far but there is a risk for consumers and the government in how far this might go,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla.",
      "\"Finding the balance not easy and is compounded by the huge north-south divide in affordability.\"",
      "Contactless limits",
      "The FCA's second new idea is to scrap the \u00a3100 limit on contactless cards, to make it easier to spend.",
      "When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at \u00a310. Cards were generally used in this way in place of small change when buying snacks, papers and occasional groceries.",
      "The limit was raised gradually, to \u00a320 in 2012, then to \u00a330 in 2015, before going up to \u00a3100 in October 2021.",
      "Both ideas would be designed to encourage spending but could also be inflationary.  They would need to go through reviews and consultation, so are unlikely to be imminent changes, even if approved.",
      "The letter also outlines potential digital advances, such as requiring firms to accept electronic verification of death to speed up bereavement claims in insurance."

    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Winconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "China's economy rebounded in the last three months of last year, allowing the government to meet its growth target of 5% in 2024, Beijing announced on Friday.",
      "But it is one of the slowest rates of growth in decades as the world's second largest economy struggles to shake off a protracted property crisis, high local government debt and youth unemployment.",
      "The head of the country's statistics bureau said China's economic achievements in 2024 were \"hard won,\" after the government launched a slew of stimulus measures late last year.",
      "Beijing has rarely missed its growth targets in the past.",
      "Experts had broadly predicted this rate of growth. The World Bank said lower borrowing costs and rising exports would mean China could achieve annual growth of 4.9%.",
      "Investors, however, are bracing themselves: the threat of President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs on $500bn (\u00a3409bn) worth of Chinese goods looms large.",
      "Yet that is not all that stands in the way of China achieving its growth targets next year.",
      "Business and consumer confidence is low, and the Chinese yuan will continue to weaken as Beijing cuts interest rates in a bid to boost growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why Xi has bigger challenges than Trump's tariffs:",
      "1. Tariffs are already hurting Chinese exports",
      "There is a growing chorus of warnings that China's economy will slow in 2025. One major driving factor of last year's growth is now at risk: exports.",
      "China has relied on manufacturing to help exit the slowdown - so, it has been exporting a record number of electric vehicles, 3D printers and industrial robots.",
      "The US, Canada and the European Union have accused China of making too many goods and imposed tariffs on Chinese imports to protect domestic jobs and businesses.",
      "Experts say Chinese exporters may now focus on other parts of the world. But those countries are likely to be in emerging markets, which don't have the same levels of demand as North America and Europe.",
      "That could impact Chinese businesses that are hoping to expand, in turn hitting suppliers of energy and raw materials.",
      "Xi wants to transform China from the world's factory for cheap goods into a high-tech powerhouse by 2035 but it's unclear how manufacturing can continue to be such a big growth driver in the face of rising tariffs.",
      "Who is China sending to Trump's inauguration?",
      "2. People are just not spending enough",
      "In China, household wealth is largely invested in the property market. Before the real estate crisis, it accounted for almost a third of China's economy - employing millions of people, from builders and developers to cement producers and interior designers.",
      "Beijing has implemented a slew of policies to stabilise the property market and the the financial markets watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), has said it will vigorously support reforms.",
      "But there are still too many empty homes and commercial properties, and that oversupply continues to force down prices.",
      "The property market slump is expected to bottom out this year, but Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs says the downturn will be a \"multi-year drag\" on China's economic growth.",
      "It's already hit spending hard - in the last three months of 2024, household consumption contributed just 29% to China's economic activity, down from 59% before the pandemic.",
      "That is one of the reasons Beijing has stepped up exports. It wants to help offset sluggish domestic spending on new cars, luxury items and almost everything else.",
      "The government has even introduced programmes like consumer goods trade-ins, where people can exchange their washing machines, microwaves and rice cookers.",
      "But experts wonder whether these kinds of measures alone are sufficient without addressing deeper issues in the economy.",
      "They say people will need more money in their pockets before pre-Covid levels for spending return.",
      "\"China needs to bring back the animal spirit of the population and we are still far from that,\" said Shuang Ding, Chief Economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.",
      "\"If the private sector starts to invest and innovate that could increase income and the job outlook, and people will have more confidence to consume.\"",
      "Steep public debt and unemployment have also affected savings and spending.",
      "Official figures suggest the youth jobless rate remains high compared to before the pandemic, and that wage rises have stalled.",
      "3. Businesses are not flocking to China like they used to",
      "President Xi has promised to invest in the cutting-edge industries that the government calls \"new productive forces\".",
      "Until now, that has helped China become a leader in goods like renewable energy products such as solar panels and electric vehicle batteries.",
      "Last year, China also overtook Japan as the world's biggest car exporter.",
      "But the lacklustre economic picture, uncertainty over tariffs and other geopolitical uncertainties mean the appetite of foreign businesses for investment in China is subdued.",
      "It's not about foreign or domestic investment - it's that businesses don't see a bright future, said Stephanie Leung from wealth management platform StashAway.",
      "\"They would like to see a more diversified set of investors coming in.\"",
      "For all of these reasons, experts believe the measures to support the economy will only partially alleviate the impact of potential new US tariffs.",
      "Beijing must either undertake big, bold measures or accept that the economy is not going to grow so fast, Goldman Sachs' Chief China Economist Hui Shan wrote in a recent report, adding: \"We expect them to choose the former.\"",
      "\"China needs to stabilise property markets and create sufficient jobs to ensure social stability,\" Mr Ding from Standard Chartered Bank said.",
      "According to researcher China Dissent Monitor, there were more than 900 protests in China between June and September 2024 led by workers and property owners - 27% more than the same period a year earlier.",
      "These sort of social strains as a result of economic grievances and an erosion of wealth will be a concern for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "After all, explosive growth turned China into a global power, and the promise of increased prosperity has largely helped its leaders keep a tight lid on dissent."

      "It is a rate the world can \"live with\" according to the bank's deputy chief economist Ayhan Kose, but would not be enough to improve people's living standards in both richer and poorer countries.",
      "He warned trade tariffs, which President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to introduce on imports to the US, could have worldwide economic consequences.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",

      "Other worries include interest rates being kept higher for longer and increased policy uncertainty denting business confidence and investment.",
      "The World Bank said even a 10% increase in US tariffs on imports from every country would reduce global economic growth by 0.2% if countries did not retaliate. If they did, the global economy could be hit harder, Mr Kose added.",
      "\"Anytime you introduce restrictions on trade there will be adverse consequences which are most often endured by the country that introduced them,\" he said.",
      "Mr Kose said the low growth rate being forecast for the world economy in 2025 meant living standards would not improve \"at the pace we saw in the past\".",
      "He pointed out that in the decade before the pandemic, growth on average was more than 3% a year.",
      "\"When you look over a longer time period we think growth numbers will come down. That worries us,\" he added.",
      "Economic growth is widely seen as fundamental to reducing poverty and funding public services such as healthcare and education.",
      "It is also key to creating the jobs and increasing pay, at a time when inflation remains above the 2% target set by central banks in the eurozone, UK and US.",
      "Governments around the world are grappling with different methods of boosting economic growth, and Mr Kose warned there no magic solutions.",
      "\"The bottom line is there is no ozempic for economic growth. Countries need to think about what policies to implement,\" he said.",
      "In the UK, the government is looking towards the artificial intelligence industry, while in the US, Trump wants to cut taxes and regulation.",

      "\"I'm doing this because Canada is the best country in the world, but it could still be even better,\" Mr Carney said, as he stood before a backdrop of a giant Canadian flag.",
      "If he wins, the 59-year-old will succeed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and lead the country into the next general election, which will take place this year.",
      "Earlier this month, Trudeau announced his intent to resign after nine years in office once a new Liberal leader is selected.",

      "The Conservatives have sought to link Mr Carney with Trudeau's unpopular government, saying he is \"just like Justin\".",

      "Mr Carney has advocated for a price on carbon, but appeared to recently back away from the policy, telling a Senate committee in May that it has \"served a purpose up until now\".",
      "On Thursday, he said that the carbon tax should be replaced with a policy \"that is at least, if not more, effective\" on climate without hurting Canadians' bottom line.",
      "Liberals are scheduled to elect their next leader on 9 March.",

    "summary": "The marginal dip in UK inflation is unusually important and offers some respite to the chancellor.",
    "story": [
      "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.",
      "Inflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.",
      "But this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it.",
      "The underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.",
      "For the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.",
      "So the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.",
      "UK inflation unexpectedly dips to 2.5% in December",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "However, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.",
      "Both tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.",
      "While some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.",
      "Similarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.",
      "What actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.",
      "So the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.",
      "That said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.",
      "Market borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.",
      "The turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy."

    "summary": "Trump will target undocumented migrants but it is unclear if legal visas like the H-2A will survive.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is expected to target undocumented immigrants, most of whom come from Central America, as soon as he takes power next week. What is lesser known is that migrants from some of the same countries have a legal route to work on American farms for a limited time.",
      "Farm labourer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz is happy.",
      "She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California.",
      "\"They paid us $19 (\u00a315.60) an hour,\" says Sandra. \"We were asked to pick seven boxes per hour, and if we picked more, then we got paid a bit extra.",
      "\"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\"",
      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",
      "It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez.",
      "She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market.  Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent.",
      "But first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the United States.",
      "\"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\"",
      "This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.",
      "Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas.",
      "\"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says.",
      "When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers.",
      "Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\"",
      "While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank.",
      "And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans.",
      "How many migrants have crossed the US border illegally?",
      "From snowy cities to Mexican border - Trump deportations loom",
      "Olga Romero lives near a town called Olopa in the north-east of Guatemala. She has seven children, two of whom are working in the US without any visas.",
      "\"This is a poor region where work is hard to find, and families often pay someone called a coyote between $2,000 and $3,000 to take them to the US illegally,\" says Olga.",
      "A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back.",
      "And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border.",
      "But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations .",
      "But it is not yet clear if he will make moves to limit, or even stop, H-2A and the other visa schemes for temporary foreign workers.",
      "Vanessa Garc\u00eda, executive director of recruitment organisation Juan Francisco Garcia Comparini Foundation, is optimistic that such visas will continue.",
      "The foundation helps send around 200 Guatemalans a year to work in the US with H-2A visas. These are farm labourers who help to harvest lettuces, cauliflowers, spinach and beans.",
      "\"I think that the opportunities for Guatemalans to get an H-2A visa will continue and perhaps even grow,\" she says. \"I am not worried, and I think this is a great opportunity for workers.\"",
      "Joe Martinez, the US-based founder and CEO of Cierto, says that while he expects the visa scheme to continue under Trump, rights for the foreign workers might be weakened.",
      "\"Cierto is concerned that the push to streamline and reduce bureaucratic processes could lead to a program with less worker protections and less oversight.\"",
      "He is worried that wages could fall for the farmworkers, and that their housing conditions on US farms may worsen.",
      "Back in Guatemala, H\u00e9ctor Benjam\u00edn Xoc Xar, says he has done two working trips to the US via the H-2A visa. The most recent one saw him working in a greenhouse growing vegetables. He says his inspiration is his family.",
      "\"I want them to do better than me academically,\" he says. \"I left school when I was still young to work in the fields.",
      "\"Before I got this work it looked like my daughter wasn't going to be able to finish her final year studying accountancy because we couldn't afford it, but now I've managed to pay for her and she's working as an accountant.\""

    "summary": "The Nordic nation doesn't require staff to work long hours and has a generous welfare system.",
    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "Joanna Clark was a headteacher at Blackhall Primary School in Hartlepool between 2009 and 2021.",
      "A report by the professional conduct panel for the Department for Education (DfE) showed Mrs Clark also failed to keep accurate DBS check records and failed to get a fence repaired in the playground, which allowed children to leave the school.",
      "Although the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) panel found her behaviour amounted to unacceptable professional conduct, the secretary of state for education decided there was a \"strong public interest consideration\" in retaining her in the profession.",
      "The report looked into a raft of alleged misconduct, with seven out of the 22 allegations proven by the panel.",
      "Some issues raised dated back as far as 2012, but most were alleged to have taken place between 2019 and 2020.",
      "'Short of standards'",
      "Mrs Clark admitted visiting the Ramside Spa during working hours, as well as failing to keep a record and inform staff of her location.",
      "The panel found this \"fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession\".",
      "It also found a broken fence between the play area and the staff car park, which she failed to have repaired, was unsafe as children could get over it and leave the premises.",
      "The report said this happened on at least one occasion.",
      "No favouritism",
      "Another allegation said Mrs Clark had discriminated against a group of children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) by separating a Year 5 class into two groups - one with no SEN children and one where most children had additional needs.",
      "The split was first implemented informally in Year 2 and later formalised until the groups reached Year 5, the report said.",
      "The panel found it was not unreasonable to divide a large year group into two classes based on ability, so \"lessons and support could be targeted to the needs of the pupils\".",
      "The report added: \"The panel found that Mrs Clark did not demonstrate favouritism, or discrimination, by maintaining the division.\"",
      "During Mrs Clark's tenure as headteacher, the school was inspected by Ofsted three times, with the rating going from Satisfactory in 2010 to Good in 2012 and 2017.",
      "\"Each inspection report included praise for Mrs Clark's leadership at the school,\" said the report.",
      "Durham County Council received an anonymous whistleblowing complaint against Mrs Clark, this was referred to the TRA, and she resigned in August 2021 before the conclusion of a disciplinary process.",
      "Show of remorse",
      "The panel considered whether she should be banned from teaching in light of her behaviour, but said there were \"extensive mitigating factors\".",
      "In the written decision, the secretary of state said Mrs Clark had \"demonstrated both insight and remorse\" and had undergone safeguarding training.",
      "She had also presented a \"substantial number\" of character references which described her \"good character and teaching abilities\" and the panel had found evidence her actions were not deliberate.",
      "The panel believed there was \"a strong public interest\" in retaining Mrs Clark in the profession.",

    "summary": "Labour paused implementation of the act after taking power, due to concerns over student welfare.",
    "story": [
      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",
      "However, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",
      "'Inciting violence'",
      "But the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.",
      "The Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",
      "But some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.",
      "When the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".",
      "'Toothless tiger'",
      "Protests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.",
      "There have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.",
      "The education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.",
      "But Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".",

      "Her career spanned 60 years and included an Oscar nomination for the 1991 film Enchanted April.",
      "She married Olivier in 1961 after starring opposite him as his daughter in The Entertainer, and became a leading member of the National Theatre, which he set up.",
      "In a statement, her family said they were \"so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being\".",
      "Obituary: Acting star whose first love was theatre",
      "Obituary: Acting star whose first love was theatre",
      "'Grit and courage'",
      "Her family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of Dame Joan Plowright, the Lady Olivier, inform you that she passed away peacefully on January 16 2025 surrounded by her family at Denville Hall aged 95.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire.",
      "\"She cherished her last 10 years in Sussex with constant visits from friends and family, filled with much laughter and fond memories.\"",
      "They added: \"She survived her many challenges with Plowright grit and courageous determination to make the best of them, and that she certainly did.",
      "\"Rest in peace, Joan...\"",
      "She had been retired for a decade, having lost her eyesight and been registered blind.",
      "Born in Scunthorpe, Plowright became a leading lady in London's West End in the 1950s, and first appeared opposite Olivier in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court in 1957.",
      "He was still married to Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh at the time, and Plowright was married to her first husband Roger Gage.",
      "Plowright and Olivier fell in love, and their acting partnership earned them both Bafta nominations for the film version of The Entertainer, which came out in 1960.",
      "That year, Plowright also made her breakthrough in the US in A Taste of Honey on Broadway, winning a Tony Award for her performance.",
      "Her other notable plays included George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, about Joan of Arc, in 1963, which for which she was named best actress at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards.",

      "Nothing Like A Dame",
      "Dame Joan was one of a generation of great acting dames, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith in the 1999 film Tea with Mussolini.",
      "More recently, she was famously seen reminiscing and enjoying repartee with Dame Judi, Dame Maggie and Dame Eileen Atkins in the 2018 BBC documentary Nothing Like A Dame.",
      "In a clip from the show, which went viral online, a slightly disguntled Dame Maggie is seen telling Dame Judi she was \"always asked first\" when acting roles were offered.",
      "The exchange was initially missed by Dame Joan because one of her hearing aids had fallen out, but she then joined in the joke, also recounting a similar story. She was then offered a spare hearing aid by the late Dame Maggie, who died in September 2024.",
      "'Incredibly wise and witty'",
      "Dame Joan was part of an \"extraordinary\" acting company that her husband assembled when the National Theatre began life at the Old Vic theatre in the early 1960s, according to playwright David Hare.",
      "Others included Maggie Smith, Michael Redgrave, Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon.",
      "\"She represented, at that point, a new realism in the theatre - a working class background, obviously, like many of her contemporaries,\" Hare told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.",
      "\"And she had the not very easy task of being Laurence Olivier's wife while Laurence Olivier was running the theatre, and she handled that situation extremely well.\"",
      "Hare added: \"I'll also remember her as an incredibly wise and witty woman. She was very good fun, and she liked to laugh, and she used humour all the time to defuse some of the tensions that grew up around her husband.\"",
      "When he first worked with her at the age of 23, Hare said he was \"totally out of my depth, and she never treated me with anything but friendliness, courtesy and wit\".",
      "The National Theatre's current director, Rufus Norris, said Dame Joan's \"contribution as one of the central pillars of the National Theatre cannot be overstated\".",
      "She delivered \"an extraordinary series of celebrated performances\" in plays including Uncle Vanya, Saint Joan, The Master Builder, Much Ado About Nothing and Three Sisters, he said.",
      "\"In many of these she acted alongside Sir Laurence Olivier, her partner in art and life.",
      "\"Joan's influence offstage on the nascent National Theatre was similarly profound, and her remarkable talent and dedication to her craft have left an enduring legacy as an actor.",
      "\"She remained a personal friend to and champion of the National Theatre throughout its history.\"",
      "'Deeply respected'",
      "West End theatres will dim their lights for two minutes in tribute to Dame Joan on Tuesday.",
      "UK Theatre and Society Of London Theatre co-chief executive Hannah Essex said: \"Dame Joan Plowright was an iconic and deeply respected figure in the world of theatre, leaving an indelible mark on the industry she shaped with her talent and dedication.",
      "\"We are honoured to contribute to the celebration of her extraordinary career and extend our heartfelt condolences to her family and loved ones.\"",
      "There was also a tribute from the operators of the Plowright Theatre in Scunthorpe, which was named after her in the 1990s.",
      "\"We are saddened to hear that Dame Joan Plowright, the esteemed British actress whose career spanned over six decades, has passed away at the age of 95,\" a statement said.",

      "Joan Plowright, who has died aged 95, was one of Britain's finest stage actresses - and later found fame on the cinema screen, although she largely preferred stage work.",
      "The Tony and Golden Globe-winning actress once said movies were a fall-back to pay the bills, saying: \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "Theatre audiences enjoyed the her versatility and good humour, and her 1961 Tony-winning Broadway role A Taste of Honey saw her play a troubled teenager, with Angela Lansbury as her mother.",
      "Other notable stage roles include Saint Joan in 1963 and Saturday, Sunday, Monday a decade later, along with films including 1992's Enchanted April and Tea with Mussolini in 1999.",
      "She was also married to acting great Sir Laurence Olivier for 28 years, until his death in 1989.",
      "After he died, Plowright continued to act into her 80s, until failing sight forced her retirement.",
      "Joan Ann Plowright was born on 29 October 1929 in Brigg, Lincolnshire.",
      "Her mother, Daisy, was a keen amateur actor and by the age of three, her daughter had taken to the stage.",
      "She went to Scunthorpe Grammar School before studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic.",
      "Her mother encouraged her choice of career, albeit with brutal candour.",
      "\"You're no oil painting,\" said Daisy, \"but you've got the spark. Just thank God you've got my legs, and not your father's.\"",
      "She made her stage debut as a professional actress, in Croydon, in 1948 and by 1956, she had joined the Royal Court theatre in London.",
      "At the time, the Royal Court was a hotbed of new talent, specialising in controversial works. It was also the spiritual birthplace of the kitchen-sink drama.",
      "Plowright gained recognition in a series of productions penned by this group of Angry Young Men, in roles that relied on acting ability rather than mere glamour.",
      "As the daughter of a Lincolnshire newspaper editor, she was far from working-class - but her down-to-earthiness and emotion honesty helped bring British theatre up to date.",
      "In 1957, she co-starred with Sir Laurence Olivier in a production of John Osborne's play The Entertainer.",
      "Olivier, who was playing Archie Rice, was at the peak of his acting career and considered something of a matinee idol.",
      "Plowright played his daughter and the actors' mutual respect led to romance. \"Nothing is so sexy in a man as talent,\" she observed.",
      "She was initially cautious about a relationship with him - Olivier was 22 years older and already one half of Britain's most celebrated theatrical couple, married to Vivien Leigh.",
      "Plowright herself was married to fellow actor Roger Gage.",
      "But Leigh, Sir Lawrence's second wife, who was troubled by mental illness,  divorced Olivier in 1960.",
      "Plowright and her husband divorced the same year.",
      "A year later, Olivier married Plowright in Connecticut - around the same time she won a Tony award on Broadway for her role in A Taste of Honey.",
      "The couple were soon appearing together in a series of plays in Chichester, in the UK, including a notable staging of Uncle Vanya.",
      "The Guardian's Michael Billington called it \"one of the great Chekhov experiences of the 20th Century...that brought tears to my eyes\".",
      "They went on to have three children, but their marriage was not without its difficulties.",
      "\"He has extremes of behaviour, which you understand,\" she later said. \"You just find a way not to be swept overboard by his demons.\"",
      "Their relationship also led her to refuse for five years to appear at the National Theatre, where her husband was director from 1962\u20131973.",
      "The actress felt  she would have been vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.",
      "Eventually though, she took a contract with the theatre for a decade, in far grander roles than those at the Royal Court.",
      "By now, her husband had been elevated to the peerage - which made her Lady Olivier - but she didn't use the title.",
      "Plowright won a Golden Globe and was Oscar-nominated for her appearance in the 1992 film Enchanted April.",
      "In fact, she won two Golden Globes in one year - the other coming for HBO TV movie Stalin.",
      "Her other films included Three Sisters in 1970 and The Merchant of Venice in 1973 - both opposite her husband and both based on National Theatre productions.",
      "She also played Mrs Fairfax in 1996's Jane Eyre, and her range went far beyond the classics in films like Dennis the Menace, Last Action Hero and 101 Dalmatians.",
      "As Lord Olivier's health declined, his wife accepted her first big-screen role in the 1990 black comedy I Love You to Death, with Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman.",
      "In 1989, Lord Olivier died of kidney failure , at the age of 82.",

      "Dame Joan found work a great solace following her husband's death, appearing in a dozen films between 2000 and 2010.",
      "They included 2003's I Am David, about a boy who escapes a gulag in Bulgaria, and the comedy Bringing Down the House, starring Steve Martin, from the same year.",
      "However, she clearly saw the silver screen as a poor cousin of the theatre.",
      "\"One can't pretend that most film dialogue is all that challenging,\" she said. \"You do films if the roof needs mending.\"",
      "As if in agreement, the theatre in her native Scunthorpe renamed itself in her honour.",
      "Her chief obstacle to more theatre work was her eyesight, she had macular degeneration, which made the stage increasingly difficult.",
      "In 2014, blindness forced her retirement from all types of acting.",
      "Four years later, she appeared alongside three old friends - Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Judi Dench - in a BBC Arena film, Nothing Like a Dame.",
      "The grandes dames of British theatre reminisced about their lives and careers, with searing honesty and humility.",
      "Filmed in the garden of the home she had shared with Olivier, Plowright spoke candidly about how she had tried to avoid playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre, feeling that she would be mocked for her lack of beauty.",
      "\"They all assume we think we're the bee's knees,\" she confessed. \"They don't realise that we're shaking inside.\""

    "summary": "Drake's record label accuses him of trying to \"silence\" Kendrick Lamar with a defamation lawsuit.",
    "story": [
      "Universal Music Group has fired back at Drake's attempt to sue it over the release of Kendrick Lamar's diss track Not Like Us last year.",
      "The Canadian musician filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing the company of defamation by allowing the song to be published, claiming it had spread the \"false and malicious narrative\" that he is a paedophile.",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade, said: \"Not only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist - let alone Drake - is illogical.\"",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "In response to claims that Universal had deliberately harmed Drake's career, the label noted it had \"invested massively\" in his music, helping him \"achieve historic commercial and personal financial success\".",
      "\"We have not and do not engage in defamation - against any individual,\" the statement concluded.",
      "Drake's lawsuit was filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday, and marks the latest chapter in his long-running feud with Lamar.",
      "The pair butted heads on a series of rap tracks last year. In one, Drake accused Lamar of domestic abuse. Lamar responded with Not Like Us, in which he characterised Drake and his entourage as \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In court documents, Drake claimed that Universal knew that Lamar's lyrics were false but \"continued to fan the flames\" of the controversy for profit.",
      "He claimed the label launched \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of the song, and suggested that a shooting at his Toronto mansion last May was directly linked to those actions.",
      "Universal, he said, \"chose corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".",
      "However, the legal case did not take aim at Lamar himself.",
      "\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents said.",

    "title": "David Lynch: Mind-bending Twin Peaks director who embraced the weird",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:08:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",
      "As Mike Muncer told BBC Arts' Inside Cinema: \"Lynch lures us in with the promise of familiar, traditional genre thrills and mysteries as a safety net, before that weirdness starts to creep in.",
      "\"Eventually, the mystery box is opened, revealing the darker, more sinister story that Lynch has actually been telling us all along.\"",
      "Cult icon",
      "In his latter years Lynch enjoyed revered cult status. In 2017, he directed Twin Peaks: The Return, a new series set 25 years after the events of the original show, with much of the same cast.",
      "At the same time, the show's legacy continues to endure, inspiring dramas like True Detective and 2023's critically acclaimed Playstation survival horror game Alan Wake II.",
      "Away from the camera, Lynch admitted he had sometimes struggled to balance the \"tricky business\" of fatherhood with his career.",
      "He welcomed four children - Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula - with ex-wives Peggy Reavey, Mary Fisk and Mary Sweeney, and estranged wife Emily Stofle.",
      "\"I love all my children and we get along great, but in the early years, before you can have a relationship of talking to them, it's tough,\" he told Vulture. \"The work is the main thing, and I know I've caused suffering because of that. But at the same time I have huge love for the kids.\"",
      "Although Lynch never did return to feature film directing to give himself another shot at an elusive Oscar win, he was granted an honorary lifetime achievement statuette by the Academy in 2019. He also made a cameo in Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical 2022 film, The Fablemans, playing filmmaker John Ford.",
      "His artistic pursuits increasingly diversified toward the end of his life, from his original passion for painting to music. Just last year, he released Cellophane Memories, an album with Chrystabell. This added to his previous work producing music videos for artists like Moby and Nine Inch Nails.",
      "Why David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is the greatest film of the 21st CenturyDavid Lynch interview: 'Even in the so-called dark things, there's beauty'",

      "He added the diagnosis was the \"price to pay\" for his smoking habit, although he didn't regret the enjoyment it gave him.",
      "But his condition deteriorated within months. In a November interview, with People magazine, Lynch said he needed oxygen to walk.",
      "However his ideas live on, as unique as the way he described thinking of them.",
      "Speaking in conversation with musician Patti Smith for BBC Newsnight in 2014, he said: \"I get ideas in fragments. It's as if in the other room there's a puzzle - all the pieces are together.",

      "She describes Ed Sheeran as her \"songwriting hero\" and says his background of busking and playing in grassroots venues is relatable.",
      "\"It's very reassuring to know that someone like him can actually do it,\" says Frizzell.",
      "\"Even though he's such a big superstar right now, he did start kind of at the same place that I did.\"",
      "Frizzell also sees an opportunity for cultural exchange, with western music figures being exposed to Indian sounds.",
      "She points to rapper Hanumankind, who has charted globally with Big Dawgs and teamed up with A$AP Rocky.",
      "\"And that is proof that having international acts come to India is also helping Indian artists [globally] break through,\" she says.",
      "But, the artists point out some possible drawbacks to the influx of global stars coming to India.",
      "The biggest risk Frizzell sees is around money - and audiences budgeting mainly for bigger artists.",
      "\"I hope I'm wrong about this, but maybe [they] would prefer the bigger international acts and not want to risk it on younger or upcoming acts.\"",
      "Anumita adds there is also a chance of artists overshadowing the attention smaller artists get.",
      "\"But then it also challenges smaller artists to maybe raise the bar.\"",

      "She gives G-Eazy's 2024 tour as an example, which had only Indian support artists - helping to boost their careers.",
      "Instead, she tells Newsbeat, the focus should be on improving infrastructure to attract the biggest of names such as Taylor Swift and Beyonce - both of whom did not bring their tours to India.",
      "Fans have often complained about facilities, concerts often held in sports stadiums used during India's lengthy cricket season and not always available year-round.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:56:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan have been announced as the three new presenters of the show.",
    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",
      "The person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.",
      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",
      "When Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).",
      "Angus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.",
      "The One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.",
      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",
      "Given that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.",
      "There is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.",
      "It is a shop window that helps keep top flight football central to the national conversation.",

    "summary": "The policy was brought in two years ago in England to try to encourage healthier food choices.",
    "story": [
      "Putting calories on food labels and menus \"is no silver bullet\", say researchers who analysed the best evidence to date on how effective the policy can be.",
      "A review of 25 studies on calorie labelling in a number of countries found a small reduction in the calories people chose to eat - equivalent to two almonds - but even  this modest effect could help prevent adults putting on weight as they get older.",
      "The new rules on calorie labelling came into force in England in 2022 as part of government plans to encourage people to make healthier choices.",
      "The government said it would continue to evaluate the impact, including on people with eating disorders.",
      "Restaurants, cafes and take-aways with more than 250 staff must now show how many calories are in meals on their menus.",
      "For Imara, a 27-year-old HR assistant from Birmingham, the change has been a positive part of her weight-loss journey.",
      "\"It has meant that I have been able to stay on track, stay within my calorie deficit and still enjoy a nice meal out with friends, or with my husband, and still have a good time and not worry about falling off track.",
      "\"Sometimes I will just have a meal and not think about the calories,\" she says.",
      "\"But if it is a day or a week where I do want to stay on track then I will look at the calories and see whether it is something that will fit within my goals.\"",
      "The research looked at studies of the impact of calorie labels in supermarkets, restaurants and other food outlets in countries including the United States, UK, Canada and France.",
      "In a 600-calorie meal, it found an average reduction of 11 calories (or 1.8%) in the food people chose and bought.",
      "Senior author Dr Gareth Hollands from University College London, said there was \"a small but potentially meaningful effect on people's food choices\" but \"we should not expect miracles\".",
      "He said calorie labelling \"may have a useful role\" alongside other measures, such as taxes on food and drinks, marketing restrictions and reformulation - making manufacturers adjust recipes for food products to make them healthier.",
      "Dr Natasha Clarke of Bath Spa University, who began the project at the University of Cambridge, says the evidence is \"robust\".",
      "And as calorie labelling becomes more widespread, the effect could have a \"meaningful contribution\" to public health.",

      "However, charities say the policy can make people with eating disorders feel more anxious about food, which could trigger a relapse.",
      "Milly Goldsmith, 27, a lifestyle influencer from London, struggled with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphia from the age of 13 to 18.",
      "She says calorie counting is what \"fed\" her eating disorder.",

      "The two maternity units at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust are rated \"good\" by England's healthcare regulator, but two whistleblowers have told the BBC they believe the units are unsafe.",
      "Separate data shows Leeds has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK.",
      "Bereaved parents say they are concerned that the trust's chief executive during the period most of the deaths occurred is now leading the regulator, saying this could affect its independence in investigating LTH Trust.",
      "In a statement, the trust told the BBC the vast majority of births at Leeds were safe, and deaths of mothers and babies were fortunately very rare.",
      "It added that Leeds cares for a higher volume of babies with complex conditions as it is one of a \"handful of specialist centres\" in the UK.",
      "The trust's maternity units are at Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital.",
      "The families describe a \"tick box\" and \"wait and see\" culture at the trust, plus a lack of compassionate care.",
      "This has been echoed by whistleblower Lisa Elliott, who worked at the two sites in 2023. Describing the care as \"appalling\", she highlighted a failure to listen to patients. \"That's when disasters happen, and a lot of them can be avoided,\" she said.",
      "The families are calling for an independent review into LTH Trust to ensure issues are identified and lessons learned. They also want an independent, judge-led public inquiry to help improve maternity safety across England because of wider concerns about the standard of care.",
      "The BBC obtained data from the trust showing potentially preventable baby deaths through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "This revealed at least 56 cases from January 2019 to July 2024, made up of 27 stillbirths and 29 neonatal deaths - which is a death within 28 days after birth.",
      "In each case, a trust review group had identified care issues it considered may have made a difference to the outcome for babies.",
      "The trust-led reviews were conducted by multidisciplinary teams which regularly included people who did not work for the trust.",
      "The trust also recorded two possibly preventable maternal deaths in the same period.",
      "It did not give any personal details about the 58 deaths, so we do not know whether they include the families we have spoken to.",
      "The deaths reviewed by the trust included babies with congenital abnormalities, and newborns and mothers transferred after birth from other units because they required specialist care.",
      "The trust said the number of neonatal deaths it had recorded as potentially avoidable was \"very small\".",
      "Warning: This article contains images that some may find distressing",
      "LTH had the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK of 4.46 per 1,000 live births in 2022, according to the latest report by MBRRACE-UK - which reviews stillbirths and neonatal deaths but does not analyse if any of these are potentially preventable.",
      "BBC analysis of this data, which was made public last July, shows this increased from 3.30 per 1,000 live births in 2017.",
      "The LTH 2022 figure is 70% higher than the average rate for comparable NHS trusts.",
      "MBRRACE-UK grouped Leeds with 25 other trusts which it says provide a similar level of care. Specifically, they all have a level three (the highest level) neonatal intensive care unit and perform neonatal surgery. The group is complex, with different specialisms.",
      "LTH told the BBC there are an increasing number of complex pregnancies and births in the region - including an increase in babies born with severe cardiac conditions - leading to an increase in the neonatal mortality rate.",
      "Fiona Winser-Ramm and Dan Ramm's first baby, Aliona Grace, died at Leeds General Infirmary in January 2020, 27 minutes after she was born.",
      "There had been delays admitting Fiona after her waters broke and a delay by midwives to escalate concerns with Aliona's heart rate during labour.",
      "There had been a \"number of gross failures of the most basic nature that directly contributed to Aliona's death\", an inquest in 2023 found.",
      "\"Leeds say they've learned lessons, it won't happen again. But it does, and babies keep dying, or being seriously injured, for similar reasons,\" says Dan.",

      "Details of advice and support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Details of advice and support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Fiona and Dan also believe the regulator - the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has failed to hold the trust accountable, despite other preventable baby deaths.",
      "The CQC inspects the quality of services across health and adult social care in England and can prosecute providers who fail to provide safe care.",
      "The couple first raised their safety concerns with the body in November 2020. They say the regulator is not fit for purpose.",
      "They are taking legal action against LTH Trust, but also want the CQC to prosecute it for its care failures.",
      "Fiona and Dan don't think any future CQC investigation into Leeds could be independent with the trust's former chief executive in charge of the regulator.",
      "Sir Julian Hartley led the trust for 10 years, until January 2023, and was in post when Aliona died. He took over the CQC in December 2024.",
      "\"There's a huge conflict of interest,\" says Dan.",
      "We approached the CQC and Sir Julian for comment and the regulator replied on behalf of both saying it was independent, with \"robust policies in place to manage any conflict of interest\".",
      "It says there are currently no criminal investigations into Leeds maternity services, but it has been in contact with families and is looking into four incidents for evidence for any future legal action.",
      "Among the bereaved parents are Amarjit Kaur and Mandip Singh Matharoo, who were expecting their first child to arrive last February.",
      "When Amarjit was 32 weeks pregnant, she went to Leeds General Infirmary's maternity unit twice within 24 hours with severe abdominal pain. She says she was told she was experiencing ligament pain in her torso and was sent home each time with paracetamol.",
      "A few days later, Amarjit underwent emergency surgery and she says a massive blood clot was found, exactly where she had described being in pain.",
      "Her daughter, Asees, was stillborn on 6 January 2024. The couple believe she would have survived if her mother had not been sent home earlier.",
      "\"It's been the hardest year of my life,\" Amarjit says.",
      "A review led by the trust of Amarjit's care identified issues it considered may have made a difference to the baby's outcome.",
      "Black mothers are nearly three times more likely to die than their white counterparts (35.1 per 100,000 maternities), with Asian women nearly twice as likely (20.16 per 100,000 maternities), latest UK figures from MBRRACE-UK show.",
      "Last year, 15.7% of registrable births at LTH were recorded as Asian and 11.8% were black.",
      "Amarjit believes she was treated differently because of her Indian ethnicity.",
      "During her first visit, she says she overheard a white woman being told by midwives that she could \"stay as long as you want\" because of her pain - but Amarjit was sent home.",
      "\"The only difference between me and her was the colour of my skin,\" she says. \"But I was in so much pain I couldn't move.\"",
      "The trust's review of Amarjit's care said \"the concerns about institutional racism have been taken seriously\" and escalated to senior management.",
      "The two whistleblowers have described unsafe care while working at both of the units.",
      "One experienced clinical staff member, currently at Leeds and who has asked to remain anonymous, told us the service is \"completely broken\" with chronic understaffing, with the impact being that \"women and babies are not getting the care we want them to get\".",
      "These concerns are echoed by a former temporary staff member, Lisa Elliott, who says she saw \"chaotic\" care when she worked approximately 40 shifts as a maternity support worker during 2023. While in this role, supporting midwives in their care of women, she says she witnessed \"rude\" treatment of patients by staff who showed a lack of empathy.",
      "Lisa, who says she began working shifts in the hospitals in 2020, says she was present for a CQC inspection in 2024, but does not think maternity services should be rated \"good\". She says she flagged concerns about staff attitudes at the time, but they were not \"taken into account properly\".",
      "Prof Phil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals told the BBC the trust wished to apologise to the women and families who had shared their negative experiences.",
      "He highlighted its status as a specialist centre caring for \"the most poorly babies\", adding that comparing the MBBRACE-UK neonatal mortality data from LTH with other hospitals, \"even in the same specialist category, is fraught with difficulty and is misleading\".",
      "Chris Dzikiti, CQC's interim chief inspector of healthcare, said LTH's maternity services have, and continue to be, subject to close oversight.",
      "He added that the maternity services at the two hospitals were inspected last month \"in response to concerns raised by families and risks identified through our ongoing monitoring\".",
      "The findings from that inspection will be published shortly.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government was determined to learn lessons from recent investigations to ensure women and babies \"receive safe, personalised and compassionate care\".",
      "They added: \"We will support trusts failing on maternity care to make rapid improvements and work closely with NHS England to train thousands more midwives to support women throughout their pregnancy and beyond.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",

      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",
      "\"Vaccine confidence across Europe is now really struggling and we can't just assume it's going to bounce back without a concerted effort.\"",

      "Currently only those who lose a child or a baby after 24 weeks are entitled to two weeks of paid leave. But a group of MPs is calling for the upcoming Employment Rights Bill to extend this to all pregnancy loss.",
      "A Department for Business spokesperson said losing a baby was \"incredibly difficult and we know many employers will show compassion and understanding in these circumstances.\"",
      "But Anna Malnutt said she went back to work three days after miscarrying: \"I just didn't really know how long was OK to take, and I felt like I needed to go back.\"",
      "Anna experienced three pregnancy losses in 2018.",
      "Despite her boss being very supportive, she decided to go back to work three days after her first miscarriage, and it was recorded as sick leave.",
      "After two further pregnancy losses, Anna said she \"became a shadow of herself,\" and struggled with stress and anxiety at work - which eventually led to her leaving her job.",
      "\"I'm sure that if I'd taken the time to recover properly and handled my return to work better, I would have stayed in that job,\" she said.",
      "'They were his babies too'",
      "Anna and her husband now have two children, and she works as a volunteer for the Miscarriage Association. She believes a right to paid bereavement leave would have been \"life changing\".",
      "Her husband attended meetings and work trips when the couple was going through their pregnancy losses.",
      "\"They were his babies too. And he never really got time or space to grieve for that himself,\" she said.",
      "Anna says it also meant he couldn't support her in the way he would have wanted to.",
      "\"If there'd have been a policy, it would have been so much easier for him to say, 'I'm going to have a couple of weeks off.'\"",
      "It is estimated that more than one in five pregnancies end before 24 weeks and around 20% of women will experience baby loss in their lifetime, according to data in the report by the cross-party Women and Equalities Committee.",
      "It is proposing bereavement leave should be extended to include those who experienced ectopic pregnancy - when a fertilised egg develops outside of the womb, molar pregnancy - when an egg is not fertilised correctly, IVF embryo transfer loss and terminations for medical reasons.",
      "More bereaved parents offered baby-loss certificate",
      "The committee acknowledged that several employers, including NHS Trusts and the Co-op, already had policies in place for employees who experienced baby loss.",
      "However, it said this was not universal.",
      "The committee chairman, Labour MP Sarah Owen, shared her own experience of baby loss.",
      "\"I was not prepared for the shock of miscarrying at work during my first pregnancy,\" she said.",
      "\"Like many women, I legally had to take sick leave. But I was grief stricken, not sick, harbouring a deep sense of loss.\"",
      "The report describes sick leave as an \"inappropriate and inadequate\" way of supporting staff through baby loss, and points out that the low rate of statutory sick pay means some people cannot afford to take the time off that they need.",
      "Kath Abrahams, chief executive of Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said she hoped the government would move quickly to change the law.",
      "\"For too many women, the psychological and physical impact of pregnancy loss is compounded by pressure to return to work immediately and a lack of time to grieve,\" she said.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that sickness absence often remains the only option, potentially leaving women and their partners financially vulnerable,\" she added.",
      "The Employment Rights Bill is currently working its way through Parliament. It's been described by the government as the \"biggest upgrade to rights at work for a generation\".",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"Our Employment Rights Bill will establish a new right to bereavement leave, make paternity and parental leave a day one right, and strengthen protections for pregnant women and new mothers returning to work.\"",

      "A new tablet being developed to cure intestinal worms has shown promising results in trials and could help eradicate the parasitic infection, which affects about 1.5 billion people globally,  researchers say.",
      "The mango-flavoured pill is a combination of two existing anti-parasitic drugs that, used together, appear more effective in getting rid of worms.",
      "These worms are caught through contact with food or water that has been infected by soil contaminated with worm eggs and infections cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms, malnutrition and anaemia.",
      "Researchers say the pill could help overcome any future drug resistance problems and better manage the disease on a large scale.",
      "The parasites, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), include whipworm and hookworm and are endemic in many developing countries where hygiene levels are poor.",
      "Many of those affected are children and there is no preventative treatment other than better sanitation.",
      "According a study, called \"ALIVE\", published in the Lancet, this new pill could help countries most affected reach goals set by the World Health Organization to eliminate the diseases.",
      "It would be taken as a fixed-dose of of either one single pill or three tablets over consecutive days.",
      "Researchers from eight European and African institutions say it would be a simple way to cure large numbers of people in mass treatment programmes.",
      "\"It is easy to administer, as it is one single pill,\"  says project leader Prof Jose Mu\u00f1oz.",
      "\"Also, we hope that combining two drugs with different mechanisms of action will reduce the risk of the parasites becoming drug-resistant,\" Prof Mu\u00f1oz says.",
      "Once a person is infected, the parasites root themselves in people's digestive tracts.",
      "While the drug albendazole is good at treating some species of STH, it appears to be becoming less effective in tackling some others.",
      "During a clinical trial involving 1,001 children aged between 5-18 in Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique, it was found to be more effective on more types of infection when combined with the drug ivermectin.",
      "However, researchers said the results were not conclusive on how well it treated threadworm.",
      "Prof. Hany Elsheikha, an expert in parasitology at the University of Nottingham said the pill could be a \"significant improvement over other treatments\" and could be used against multiple parasites.",
      "\"There are some challenges with existing medications...so this could be a major, major addition.\"",

      "Participants are now being recruited to take part in a further trial on 20,000 people  in Kenya and Ghana.",

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",
      "Labour has made growth its key objective, but Reeves has admitted the government has to \"do more to grow our economy\", in order to boost living standards.",

      "Responding to the IMF's report, Reeves highlighted that the UK was the only G7 economy, apart from the US, to have its growth forecast upgraded for 2025.",
      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth - from geopolitics to the weather. But such reports can point in the right direction, especially where they align with other predictions.",
      "Global growth forecast to flatline as tariffs add to strains",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "The IMF predicted \"stable, albeit lacklustre\" global growth of 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026, below a historical average of 3.7%.",
      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",
      "This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",
      "Its chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said \"tremendous uncertainty\" about Trump's future policies was already affecting stock markets around the world.",
      "On Thursday, the World Bank also warned that US tariffs could hit trade and depress global growth this year.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has triggered a row after saying her party wants to explore greater means-testing of government support.",
      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Why do politicians keep talking about locks?",
      "During a phone-in on LBC, Badenoch said the UK, like other Western nations, faced a \"structural problem\" because people were living longer while having fewer children.",
      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",
      "She went on to add: \"Means-testing is something which we don't do properly here.",
      "\"Starting with the triple lock is not how to solve the problem, we need to start with why are we not making the same kind of money we used to make?\"",
      "'Bungling Badenoch'",
      "However, her comments were seized on by opposition parties to suggest the Tories were planning to shift their stance on the triple lock, which Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all pledged to continue in last year's general election.",
      "Labour said the Tory leader had \"let the mask slip\" and was preparing to cut the state pension, while the Liberal Democrats said \"bungling Badenoch\" was preparing to make pension cuts \"her first new policy\".",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this, adding the party had \"always protected the triple lock\" and accusing Labour of \"skewing her words for political gain\".",
      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",
      "As a Tory leadership candidate last September, she appeared to suggest maternity pay was \"excessive\" before later arguing she was making a more general point about the burden of regulations on business.",
      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has argued the policy is \"unsustainable\" in the \"very, very long term\".",
      "Since taking office Labour has decided to means-test the winter fuel payment, a \u00a3200-\u00a3300 pension supplement that was previously paid to all pensioners, by linking eligibility to pension credit.",
      "Badenoch said she opposed that decision, arguing it would mean pensioners \"on the breadline\" would miss out. She added, however, that she supported the idea it should not go to \"millionaires\".",
      "Writing later on X, Badenoch said the government needed \"better mechanisms\" to target support, instead of using \"proxies\" such as eligibility for pension credit or free school meals."

      "She stopped short of launching a statutory national inquiry, as called for by the Conservatives and some Labour MPs, but this marks a clear shift in the government's position.",
      "Cooper said top lawyer Tom Crowther, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help Oldham and four other pilot areas yet to be named, develop their own reviews.",
      "She also announced a \"rapid\" three month national audit headed by veteran government trouble-shooter Baroness Louise Casey to examine the demographics of the gangs and their victims, as well as \"cultural drivers\" behind the offending.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plan was \"wholly inadequate\" and repeated his call for a full national inquiry.",
      "He expressed concern that the local inquiries would not have the powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence under oath.",
      "The issue had recently been thrust into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has criticised the prime minister for not calling a national inquiry.",
      "Mr Musk responded to Cooper's announcement by saying on his X platform: \"I hope this is a proper investigation\". He added: \"This is a step in the right direction, but the results will speak for themselves.\"",

      "Starmer attacks those 'spreading lies' on grooming gangs",
      "The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?",
      "The row between Mr Musk and Starmer centred on high-profile cases where groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - were convicted of sexually abusing and raping predominantly young white girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham. She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",

      "The prime minister and Labour ministers had said their priority was to implement the Jay recommendations, and Cooper announced that one of the key points - mandatory reporting - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "In a statement in the House of Commons, Cooper said that despite Prof Jay's report and other inquiries, \"shamefully little progress had been made\".",
      "\"That has got to change,\" she said and added that by Easter, the government would set out a \"clear timetable\" for implementing the Jay report's recommendations.",

      "She said this included introducing a \"duty of candour\" which requires public servants to tell the truth.",
      "The separate audit looking at the ethnicity of grooming gangs and their victims will be led by Baroness Casey, who previously led the 2015 review of Rotherham Council.",
      "The crossbench peer has already been appointed to lead a commission into social care, but Downing Street insisted the two pieces of work would not clash, saying her work on grooming gangs would be finished by the start of April.",
      "In her statement, Cooper also announced she would be asking chief constables in England and Wales to re-examine historic gang exploitation cases and re-open investigations \"were appropriate\". This would be backed by \u00a32.5m of funding, she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 11:19:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level for several years - what does it mean for you?",
    "story": [
      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

      "Siddiq's mother and aunt survived because they were abroad.",
      "Siddiq joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, later giving the NHS and the care her disabled father as the main reason.",
      "She named former cabinet minister Barbara Castle as her political heroine, and has described her mother and maternal aunt as \"two very strong feminists\".",
      "Pre-politics, she worked for Amnesty International, Save The Children and the Greater London Authority, among others.",
      "By 2010, she was working with Ed Miliband's successful campaign for the Labour leadership, also spending time as a special adviser to former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell.",
      "She had also been elected to Camden council in north London. After former Oscar-winning actress Glenda Jackson announced she was standing down as an MP, Siddiq was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead and Kilburn seat.",

      "In 2017, while campaigning for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Siddiq was asked in a Channel 4 News interview why she had not challenged her aunt, who had been accused of leading an authoritarian government in Bangladesh guilty of human rights abuses.",
      "A row ensued, the programme's editor complained her behaviour to a pregnant producer had been \"threatening\", and Siddiq apologised.",

      "Even by the standards of the Reform UK party, it has been an interesting few weeks.",
      "In December, its leader Nigel Farage flew to Florida to meet Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire, where they discussed a possible donation.",
      "On Boxing Day, it announced its membership figures had surpassed those of the Conservatives. There was then a spat with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch over whether those numbers were correct.",

      "\"He is destructive, he could destroy Reform.\"",
      "There are about 850 attendees at Sandown, according to the organisers, who say it was a sold out event.",

      "They are new members, new to politics and Caroline says she puts the chances of Farage being prime minister after the next election at 10 out of 10.",
      "The party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour, says Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common, with ratings up from around 15 to 20%. But a general election is years away.",
      "Whether the party can go from five MPs in 2024 to government remains to be seen, but whatever happens, it's clear there are party members still enthused by Reform's offer."

      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",

The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:05:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Wild tigers killed nearly 40 people in Nepal between 2019 and 2023. Solutions are hard to come by.",
    "story": [
      "Nepal has been celebrated globally for tripling its tiger population in a decade - but Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli thinks the country may have been too successful.",
      "\"In such a small country, we have more than 350 tigers\u2026 We can't have so many tigers and let them eat up humans,\" he said last month at an event organised to review the country's COP29 outcomes.",
      "Attacks by tigers claimed nearly 40 lives and injured 15 people between 2019 and 2023, according to government data. But local communities say the figure is much higher.",
      "\"For us, 150 tigers are enough,\" Oli declared in December, even suggesting that Nepal could send its prized big cats to other countries as gifts.",
      "How many tigers are too many?",
      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",

      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",
      "\"We find quite elaborately furnished graves with high status objects of wealth. Every time we find that, it occurs in women's graves, so we think wealth was being transferred down the female line,\" says Prof Martin Smith at Bournemouth university.",
      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",

      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",

      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:34:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "summary": "Nine in 10 new cars in the country are now battery-powered, and it aims to hit 100% later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

    "title": "Americans and Chinese share jokes on 'alternative TikTok' as US ban looms",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:07:26 GMT",
    "summary": "RedNote's Chinese users say it is the first time they have been able to speak directly to Americans online.",
    "story": [
      "A looming TikTok ban has connected Chinese and American citizens like never before, as they swap jokes and memes in what one user described as a \"historic moment\".",
      "It's all unfolding on a popular Chinese social media app called RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (literally translates as Little Red Book), which doesn't have the usual internet firewall that separates China from the rest of the world.",
      "It has been drawing self-professed US \"TikTok refugees\" seeking a new home on the internet - despite the fact that their own government is seeking a TikTok ban because of national security concerns.",
      "Americans now find themselves in direct contact with 300 million Mandarin speakers in China and elsewhere \u2013 while in the real world, Beijing is bracing for a tumultuous Trump presidency that could strain its fragile ties with Washington.",
      "'We're here to spite our government'",
      "At the heart of the US ban is the fear that China is using TikTok to spy on Americans.",
      "The app has faced accusations that user data is ending up in the hands of the Chinese government - because of a Beijing law that requires local companies to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". TikTok denies this has ever happened, or that it would happen.",
      "But the possibility doesn't seem to worry some US users - 700,000 new users have signed on to RedNote in the last two days, making it the most downloaded free app in the US App store.",
      "\"The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they're insisting that it's owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,\" said one new RedNote user, Definitelynotchippy.",
      "She goes on to explain why she is on RedNote: \"A lot of us are smarter than that though so we decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app. We call that trolling, so in short we're here to spite our government and to learn about China and hang out with you guys.\"",
      "TikTok, although owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is headquartered in Singapore and says it is run independently. In fact, China's version of TikTok is another app called Douyin. RedNote, on the other hand, is a Chinese company based in Shanghai and among the few social media apps available both in China and outside.",
      "So Washington's fears over TikTok would extend to RedNote as well.",
      "That's why American users on RedNote are referring to themselves as \"Chinese spies\" - continuing a TikTok trend where people have been bidding farewell to their \"personal Chinese spy\" who has allegedly been surveilling them over the years.",
      "RedNote is now full of posts where ex-TikTok users are in search of a replacement. One post says: \"I'm looking for my Chinese spy. I miss you. Please help me find him.\"",
      "And Chinese users have answered: \"I'm here!\"",
      "'People-to-people exchanges'",
      "The honest, funny conversations on RedNote may not be what Chinese President Xi Jinping had in mind when he spoke about \"strengthening people-to-people cultural exchanges\" between China and the US.",
      "But that is certainly what is happening as excited Chinese users welcome curious Americans to the app.",
      "\"You don't even need to travel abroad, you can just talk to foreigners here,\" said one Chinese RedNote user in a video that has received more than 6,000 likes.",
      "\"But it's honestly insane, no-one would have expected that we could meet like this  one day, openly communicate like this.\"",
      "Food, streaming shows and jobs have been the most popular topics: \"Is life in America similar to how it looks on [the US TV show] Friends?\"",
      "Other Chinese users demanded a \"tax\" for using the platform - cat photos.",
      "\"Cat tax from California,\" reads one post in response. \"Here's my offering - the shorthair is a boy named Bob and the calico is a girl named Marley.\"",
      "Still others are using the platform to ask Americans for help with their English homework.",
      "One post reads: \"Dear TikTok refugees, could you please tell me the answer to question 53? Is the answer T (true) or F (false)?\"",
      "Help came quickly: some 500 people have since answered.",
      "The flood of new American users appears to have caught RedNote off guard - reports say the company is hiring English moderators.",
      "And others are trying to cash in on RedNote's new-found US stardom as well: language-learning app Duolingo put out a graph showing a 216% jump in its user base, compared to this time last year.",
      "Is RedNote the new TikTok?",
      "RedNote's rising popularity is not guaranteed to last though.",
      "There is no reason to assume it won't face blowback for the same reasons as TikTok:  concerns that it could be used by China to spy on Americans.",
      "It's unclear how long Beijing would be open to such unfettered exchanges - control of the internet is key to its repressive regime.",
      "The irony of the situation was flagged by one Chinese user, who posted: \"Don't we have a (fire)wall? How come so many foreigners can enter, when clearly I can't leave?\"",
      "Typically, Chinese internet users have been unable to directly interact with foreigners. Global platforms like Twitter and Instagram and search engines like Google are blocked in China, though people use VPNs to circumvent these restrictions. Sensitive topics - from history to dissent - or anything seen as critical of China's government and ruling Communist party is swiftly censored.",
      "It's unclear how much RedNote is censored - it's largely used by younger and middle-aged women in China, where they share images and videos. It's not like Weibo, another Chinese app, where discussions and airing of grievances is far more common, leading to posts often being taken down.",
      "But a handful of new RedNote users say they have already received reports that their posts have violated guidelines, including one who asked in a post if the app was \"LGBT friendly\".",
      "Another said they had asked \"What [sic] Chinese think about gay people?\" and received a similar notification, that they had violated \"public moral order\" guidelines.",
      "And Chinese users keep reminding Americans on the app \"not to mention sensitive topics, such as politics, religion and drugs\".",
      "One Chinese user also advised them to stick to the \"One China policy\", the diplomatic pillar of the US-China relationship - according to which the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan, the self-governed island Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The US government has not commented on RedNote so far, and neither has Beijing.",
      "But Chinese state media seems upbeat about it, with Global Times even interviewing a US user who said she would \"love to interact with Chinese users\".",
      "RedNote's American fate is anyone's guess - but for now, at least online, the US-China rivalry is taking a break. Thanks to cat pictures."

    "story": [
      "TikTok is set to be banned in the US on 19 January after the Supreme Court denied a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.",
      "It found the law banning the social media platform did not violate the first amendment rights of TikTok and its 170 million users, as the companies argued.",

      "So if the ban ends up taking this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will still be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "However there are other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",

      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

      "Google accounts for 90% of UK web searches  - the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking at whether it is using that dominant position to harm competition or choice for users.",
      "It is its first investigation after gaining new powers to investigate and enforce changes at firms it determines to have \"strategic market status\" in digital markets.",
      "The CMA says it wants to ensure the tech giant is \"delivering good outcomes for people and businesses\" and that there is a \"level playing field\" for rivals.",
      "Google says it will cooperate with the investigation but has warned against what it calls \"overly prescriptive digital competition rules.\"",
      "In a statement Google said: \"We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to ensure that new rules benefit all types of websites, and still allow people in the UK to benefit from helpful and cutting edge services.\"",
      "It is the latest in a series of investigations Google faces worldwide.",
      "In the US, the government wants it to sell its browser, Chrome, to address what a judged ruled was its illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.",
      "The CMA says potential changes it could impose include sharing data Google collects with other businesses, or giving publishers more oversight of how their data is used for its artificial intelligence (AI) features.",
      "\"Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services,\" said Sarah Cardell, the CMA's chief executive on Tuesday.",
      "\"And for businesses, whether you are a rival search engine, an advertiser or a news organisation, we want to ensure there is a level playing field for all businesses, large and small, to succeed.\" she added, especially given the potential for AI to \"transform\" the market.",
      "'A fair deal'",
      "The CMA's announcement of its Google search and advertising investigation follows the digital market competition regime coming into force in January.",
      "It gives the CMA powers to investigate firms it believes may dominate or occupy a key strategic position in a certain sector.",
      "An explainer on its website says a company must meet several conditions before it can be determined to have \"strategic market status\".",
      "These include having a UK turnover of more than \u00a31bn or global turnover of \u00a325bn,  occupying a position of strategic significance or \"entrenched market power\" in relation to a certain digital activity.",
      "The CMA says it will look at whether Google is using its position in search to prevent rivals from innovating or entering the market, or if it is \"self-preferencing\" its own services.",
      "It will also look at whether Google is collecting large amounts of user data without proper, informed consent.",
      "\"It's our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal - for example in how their data is collected and stored,\" said Ms Cardell.",
      "It will have nine months to carry out its investigation and two options at its disposal if it finds Google to have strategic market status - imposing rules on how it behaves, or making interventions designed to boost competition.",
      "Pinar Akman, professor of law at the University of Leeds, says it is \"highly likely\" the CMA will launch further, similar investigations under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer (DMCC) Act in coming months.",
      "\"There is a general trend of regulating digital markets with large players around the world and the DMCC Act represents the UK's response to that growing trend,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Prof Akman added that the regime offers more flexibility than regulation such as the EU's Digital Markets Act in tailoring any interventions or requirements to market specifics.",
      "It comes after the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer lauded AI's \"vast potential\" to transform public services.",
      "In a speech on Monday, Sir Keir said recommendations from the AI Opportunities Action Plan - a set of proposals backed by several tech firms - would be implemented across a range of areas to help grow the economy and make AI \"work for working people\"."

      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",

      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",

      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",

      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "TikTok had challenged the law, arguing it would violate free speech protections for the app's more than 170 million users it says it has in the US.",
      "But that argument was rejected by the nation's highest court, meaning TikTok must now find an approved buyer for the US version of the app or face being removed from app stores and web hosting services.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:57:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok is set to be banned in the US on 19 January after the Supreme Court denied a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance.",
      "It found the law banning the social media platform did not violate the first amendment rights of TikTok and its 170 million users, as the companies argued.",
      "But will the decision of the country's highest judicial authority actually stop Americans using it?",
      "President-elect Donald Trump says, simply, the future of TikTok is up to him.",
      "And the White House says \"given the sheer fact of timing\", the process of implementing the law will indeed fall to Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday - the day after the ban comes into effect.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "Can Trump still intervene?",
      "Trump may once have sought to ban TikTok - but he has repeatedly indicated during 2024 that he is now firmly against the law, and tried unsuccessfully to get it delayed.",
      "And despite the court's ruling, in an interview with CNN, he has insisted TikTok's future rests with him - even if he gave no indication of what his decision on the future of the social media platform would be.",
      "\"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision,\" he said.",
      "Before that interview he has made it clear however he would be seeking what he previously called a \"political solution.\"",
      "On Friday, just before the court released its ruling, he said he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok, as well as issues around trade.",
      "\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately,\" he posted on social media.",
      "And on Thursday Trump's incoming national security advised Mike Waltz told Fox News the president-elect was looking for ways to \"preserve\" TikTok, saying Americans' access to the platform and their data would be preserved.",
      "\"I don't want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we're going to create the space to put that deal in place,\" Mr Waltz said.",
      "The Biden administration has made clear they will not enforce the law - so another option would be for Trump to follow suit and allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "If Trump can't unban TikTok, then what happens?",
      "The most likely way the US would enforce the ban is to order app stores to make it unavailable for download in that region.",

      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "But because the app most likely won't be publicly available anymore, new updates will no longer be delivered to users in the US - which will make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks.",
      "However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban ends up taking this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will still be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "However there are other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said the complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change now that it has actually been banned - and what will happen when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December."

    "summary": "The record rise is incompatible with keeping global warming to 1.5C according to the Met Office.",
    "story": [
      "Levels of the most significant planet-warming gas in our atmosphere rose more quickly than ever previously recorded last year, scientists say, leaving a key global climate target hanging by a thread.",
      "Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are now more than 50% higher than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere.",
      "The rapid increase in CO2 is \"incompatible\" with the international pledge to try to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Met Office says.",
      "This was the ambitious goal agreed by nearly 200 countries at a landmark UN meeting in Paris in 2015, with the hope of avoiding some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "Last week it was confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first calendar year in which annual average temperatures were higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "This did not break the Paris goal, which refers to a longer-term average over decades, but continued increases to atmospheric CO2 effectively consign the world to doing so.",
      "\"Limiting global warming to 1.5C would require the CO2 rise to be slowing, but in reality the opposite is happening,\" says Richard Betts of the Met Office.",
      "2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "The long-term CO2 increase is unquestionably due to human activities, mainly through burning coal, oil and gas, and cutting down forests.",
      "Records of the Earth's climate in the distant past from ice cores and marine sediments show that CO2 levels are currently at their highest in at least two million years, according to the UN.",
      "But the rise varies from year to year, thanks to differences in how the natural world absorbs carbon, as well as fluctuations in humanity's emissions.",
      "Last year, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels reached new highs, according to preliminary data from the Global Carbon Project team.",
      "There were also the effects of the natural El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm, affecting weather patterns.",
      "The natural world has absorbed roughly half of humanity's CO2 emissions, for example through extra plant growth and more of the gas being dissolved in the ocean.",
      "But that extra blast of heat from El Ni\u00f1o against the background of climate change meant natural carbon sinks on land did not take up as much CO2 as usual last year.",
      "Rampant wildfires, including in regions not usually affected by El Ni\u00f1o, also released extra CO2.",
      "\"Even without the boost from El Ni\u00f1o last year, the CO2 rise driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation would now be outpacing the [UN climate body] IPCC's 1.5C scenarios,\" says Prof Betts.",
      "These factors meant that between 2023 and 2024 CO2 levels increased by nearly 3.6 parts per million (ppm) molecules of air to a new high of more than 424ppm.",
      "This is a record yearly increase since atmospheric measurements were first taken at the remote Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii in 1958. Perched high on the side of a volcano in the Pacific Ocean, the station's remote location away from major pollution sources makes it ideally suited to monitoring global CO2 levels.",
      "\"These latest results further confirm that we are moving into uncharted territory faster than ever as the rise continues to accelerate,\" says Prof Ralph Keeling, who leads the measurement programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US.",
      "The record increase adds to concerns that the natural world may become less able to absorb planet-warming gases in the long-term.",
      "The Arctic tundra is being transformed into an overall source of CO2, thanks to warming and frequent fires, according to the US science group NOAA.",
      "The ability of the Amazon rainforest to absorb CO2 is also being hit by drought, wildfires and deliberate deforestation.",
      "\"It's an open question, but it's something we need to keep a close eye on and look at very carefully,\" Prof Betts tells the BBC.",
      "The Met Office predicts the increase in CO2 concentration in 2025 will be less extreme than 2024, but still significantly off-track to meet the 1.5C target.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a conditions \u2013 where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are cooler than normal - have replaced El Ni\u00f1o, which tends to allow the natural world to take up more CO2.",

      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",
      "\"It's a magic moment for the life of Pompeii, and this excavation work offers us the possibility to share this with the public.\"",

      "Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were arrested in October 2023 as Russian authorities intensified pressure on the jailed Kremlin critic, who died suddenly last February in an Arctic prison colony.",
      "They were put on trial behind closed doors in Petushki, a town east of Moscow, and accused of \"using their status\" to relay messages between Navalny and his colleagues.",
      "Navalny had condemned the case as just like Soviet times, and an indication of \"the state of rule of law in Russia\".",
      "Igor Sergunin was the only one of the three to admit the charge, according to independent reports, and was given a lighter sentence of three-and-a-half years.",
      "Alexei Liptser was jailed for five years in a penal colony and Vadim Kobzev was given five-and-a-half years.",
      "Kobzev's own lawyer, Andrei Grivtsov, said the evidence against them amounted to illegal invasion of privacy.",
      "\"They're not allowed to eavesdrop on meetings between a lawyer and a client in a penal colony in principle - there's a direct legislative ban,\" he told BBC Russian.",
      "Alexei Liptser's lawyer, Andrei Orlov, told reporters that Friday's court decision was very sad: \"But we are not going to stop just yet. We are going to keep moving.\"",
      "The three lawyers were put on trial close to the penal colony in Pokrov, where Navalny was initially sent when he returned to Russia in January 2021, having survived a nerve agent attack that he blamed on Russian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Kremlin denied the allegation and Navalny remained in Russian penal colonies until his death, north of the Arctic Circle and 1,900km (1,200 miles) north-east of Moscow.",
      "His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, blamed Putin for his death, which authorities put down to \"sudden death syndrome\".",
      "Several months after Navalny was detained in 2021, Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation and his regional offices were banned by a Moscow court, which classified them as \"extremist\".",
      "Navalny, who was already in jail on other charges, was then convicted of founding and funding an extremist organisation too.",

      "Amnesty International said that by targeting lawyers \"for merely doing their job, the Russian authorities are dismantling what remains of the right to legal defence\".",
      "According to investigators, the three men had acted as members of Navalny's \"extremist community\", meeting the opposition leader and exchanging information with him.",
      "Yulia Navalnaya said the three men were \"political prisoners and should be freed immediately\".",
      "Another of Navalny's lawyers, Olga Mikhailova, who has left Russia, said the sentences were \"brutal and absurd\" and that the men had been punished for honestly carrying out \"their duties, their professional and moral position\".",

And his predecessor, Wang Qishan, was present for the inauguration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in 2022 and Brazil's President Lula da Silva in 2023.",
      "Xi's decision to send Han to the US is a sign that he \"wants to get Trump into deal-making mode, but [he] does not want to be a supporting actor in the Trump show on January 20,\" says Neil Thomas, a fellow in Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "Other foreign leaders that have been invited to the inauguration include Argentinian President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",

      "Five people were charged over his death, including Mr Nores, who was accused of manslaughter. Argentine prosecutors claimed he \"abandoned\" the singer and failed in his duty of care responsibilities.",
      "In a legal complaint filed in the US state of Florida on Wednesday, Mr Nores claimed Payne's father made \"false\" declarations to Argentine officials which \"contained material omissions, and many parts were not based on personal knowledge\".",
      "The disputed statements include allegations that, \"due to his addictions\", Payne was in the care of his girlfriend Kate Cassidy and Mr Nores.",

      "Ms Philip said a man appeared holding a wooden object in one hand and a long blade in another and warned the two against making any noise. He demanded 10m rupees ($115,477; \u00a394,511), she said.",
      "A scuffle soon broke out, during which Ms Philip was injured. Meanwhile, the nanny fled the room.",
      "According to the nurse's statement, Khan and his wife, actress Kareena Kapoor, rushed to the room after hearing the commotion. She said the attacker struck Khan with a blade when he confronted him, then fled the house.",
      "Khan suffered several injuries - including one on the back of his neck - in the attack.",
      "Dr Nitin Dange of Lilavati Hospital, where Khan is being treated, said that when the actor arrived, he was bleeding from his spine with a knife fragment embedded.

      "This comes after 15 months of conflict in which the UN and aid agencies have accused Israel of repeatedly blocking or delaying distribution of vital food, medicine and fuel.

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:07:26 GMT",
    "summary": "RedNote's Chinese users say it is the first time they have been able to speak directly to Americans online.",
    "story": [
      "A looming TikTok ban has connected Chinese and American citizens like never before, as they swap jokes and memes in what one user described as a \"historic moment\".",
      "It's all unfolding on a popular Chinese social media app called RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (literally translates as Little Red Book), which doesn't have the usual internet firewall that separates China from the rest of the world.",
      "It has been drawing self-professed US \"TikTok refugees\" seeking a new home on the internet - despite the fact that their own government is seeking a TikTok ban because of national security concerns.",
      "Americans now find themselves in direct contact with 300 million Mandarin speakers in China and elsewhere \u2013 while in the real world, Beijing is bracing for a tumultuous Trump presidency that could strain its fragile ties with Washington.",
      "'We're here to spite our government'",
      "At the heart of the US ban is the fear that China is using TikTok to spy on Americans.",
      "The app has faced accusations that user data is ending up in the hands of the Chinese government - because of a Beijing law that requires local companies to \"support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work\". TikTok denies this has ever happened, or that it would happen.",
      "But the possibility doesn't seem to worry some US users - 700,000 new users have signed on to RedNote in the last two days, making it the most downloaded free app in the US App store.",
      "\"The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they're insisting that it's owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,\" said one new RedNote user, Definitelynotchippy.",
      "She goes on to explain why she is on RedNote: \"A lot of us are smarter than that though so we decided to piss off our government and download an actual Chinese app. We call that trolling, so in short we're here to spite our government and to learn about China and hang out with you guys.\"",
      "TikTok, although owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is headquartered in Singapore and says it is run independently. In fact, China's version of TikTok is another app called Douyin. RedNote, on the other hand, is a Chinese company based in Shanghai and among the few social media apps available both in China and outside.",
      "So Washington's fears over TikTok would extend to RedNote as well.",
      "That's why American users on RedNote are referring to themselves as \"Chinese spies\" - continuing a TikTok trend where people have been bidding farewell to their \"personal Chinese spy\" who has allegedly been surveilling them over the years.",
      "RedNote is now full of posts where ex-TikTok users are in search of a replacement. One post says: \"I'm looking for my Chinese spy. I miss you. Please help me find him.\"",
      "And Chinese users have answered: \"I'm here!\"",
      "'People-to-people exchanges'",
      "The honest, funny conversations on RedNote may not be what Chinese President Xi Jinping had in mind when he spoke about \"strengthening people-to-people cultural exchanges\" between China and the US.",
      "But that is certainly what is happening as excited Chinese users welcome curious Americans to the app.",
      "\"You don't even need to travel abroad, you can just talk to foreigners here,\" said one Chinese RedNote user in a video that has received more than 6,000 likes.",
      "\"But it's honestly insane, no-one would have expected that we could meet like this  one day, openly communicate like this.\"",
      "Food, streaming shows and jobs have been the most popular topics: \"Is life in America similar to how it looks on [the US TV show] Friends?\"",
      "Other Chinese users demanded a \"tax\" for using the platform - cat photos.",
      "\"Cat tax from California,\" reads one post in response. \"Here's my offering - the shorthair is a boy named Bob and the calico is a girl named Marley.\"",
      "Still others are using the platform to ask Americans for help with their English homework.",
      "One post reads: \"Dear TikTok refugees, could you please tell me the answer to question 53? Is the answer T (true) or F (false)?\"",
      "Help came quickly: some 500 people have since answered.",
      "The flood of new American users appears to have caught RedNote off guard - reports say the company is hiring English moderators.",
      "And others are trying to cash in on RedNote's new-found US stardom as well: language-learning app Duolingo put out a graph showing a 216% jump in its user base, compared to this time last year.",
      "Is RedNote the new TikTok?",
      "RedNote's rising popularity is not guaranteed to last though.",
      "There is no reason to assume it won't face blowback for the same reasons as TikTok:  concerns that it could be used by China to spy on Americans.",
      "It's unclear how long Beijing would be open to such unfettered exchanges - control of the internet is key to its repressive regime.",
      "The irony of the situation was flagged by one Chinese user, who posted: \"Don't we have a (fire)wall? How come so many foreigners can enter, when clearly I can't leave?\"",
      "Typically, Chinese internet users have been unable to directly interact with foreigners. Global platforms like Twitter and Instagram and search engines like Google are blocked in China, though people use VPNs to circumvent these restrictions. Sensitive topics - from history to dissent - or anything seen as critical of China's government and ruling Communist party is swiftly censored.",
      "It's unclear how much RedNote is censored - it's largely used by younger and middle-aged women in China, where they share images and videos. It's not like Weibo, another Chinese app, where discussions and airing of grievances is far more common, leading to posts often being taken down.",
      "But a handful of new RedNote users say they have already received reports that their posts have violated guidelines, including one who asked in a post if the app was \"LGBT friendly\".",
      "Another said they had asked \"What [sic] Chinese think about gay people?\" and received a similar notification, that they had violated \"public moral order\" guidelines.",
      "And Chinese users keep reminding Americans on the app \"not to mention sensitive topics, such as politics, religion and drugs\".",
      "One Chinese user also advised them to stick to the \"One China policy\", the diplomatic pillar of the US-China relationship - according to which the US recognises and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan, the self-governed island Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The US government has not commented on RedNote so far, and neither has Beijing.",
      "But Chinese state media seems upbeat about it, with Global Times even interviewing a US user who said she would \"love to interact with Chinese users\".",
      "RedNote's American fate is anyone's guess - but for now, at least online, the US-China rivalry is taking a break. Thanks to cat pictures."

      "If you live outside Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, you can be forgiven if you don't remember the events of that day - 14 May 2018. After all the terrible bloodshed since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, specific days that led up to the war in Gaza can be easily forgotten.",
      "But in a world where most people get their news online, it was also declared to be the ultimate split-screen moment.",

      "On the other side of the screen Israeli soldiers were shooting into Gaza to kill and wound Palestinians who were trying to break through the border fence.",
      "Between 50 and 60 Palestinians were killed that day. Many more suffered gruesome bullet wounds.",
      "It was the culmination of an event that Hamas, Gaza's rulers, had called the \"Great March of Return\". Thousands were taking part.",
      "Small groups, mostly young men, were advancing on the wire. About a kilometre back were thousands of peaceful demonstrators. Families were picnicking on the sand. They screamed and fled when Israeli drones bombed them with tear gas.",
      "Hamas commanders must have concluded it would take more than mass protest to break into Israel.",
      "On 7 October 2023, in a much bigger and better planned assault that took Israel by surprise, Hamas breached the border. Its men killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took 251 others into Gaza as hostages.",
      "In the war that followed, Israel has exacted a terrible revenge, leaving most of Gaza in ruins and killing almost 50,000 according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Israel insists that those figures are exaggerated. But a new study in the British medical journal, The Lancet, suggests that the Palestinian ministry of health has \"under-reported mortality by 41%\".",
      "All American presidents support Israel. But the lesson Israel's nationalist right took from their side of the split screen was that Donald Trump would be unusually accommodating.",
      "Trump the disruptor",
      "The embassy move showed Trump was prepared to break with conventional wisdom that he believed was an obstacle to US interests.",
      "He abandoned the long-standing policy of Israel's Western allies, and most other countries, to keep their embassies in Tel Aviv until a peace deal with the Palestinians decided Jerusalem's permanent status.",
      "The embassy opening celebration came the week after he pulled the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran, which he called \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into\".",
      "He also had the satisfaction of derailing his predecessor Barack Obama's biggest foreign policy achievement.",
      "Trump's ditching of the Iran agreement was the triumphant end to a long campaign for Netanyahu.",
      "In March 2019 Donald Trump went further by accepting Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Syrian territory which Israel had occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "Recognising Israel's annexation of the Golan broke with a Western consensus since the aftermath of World War Two that states should not acquire territory through military action.",
      "The new Abraham Accords",
      "In 2020 the Trump administration gave Israel another prize. Jared Kushner brokered the Abraham Accords between Israel on one side and the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Sudan and Bahrain. The US gave all four countries sweeteners in return for their co-operation.",
      "They were persuaded to abandon the long-standing Arab peace initiative, that promised Israel full recognition in return for allowing Palestinians to establish their own state in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. For Israel it amounted to a free gift.",
      "Biden, like Trump in his first term, wanted to extend the Abraham Accords to Saudi Arabia. Recognition of Israel by the Saudis, the keeper of Islam's two holiest shrines, the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and the richest and most powerful Arab state, would be hugely significant.",
      "In return, the Saudis would get a comprehensive security pact with the US, which would of course include more arms deals.",
      "It was about more than lucrative business opportunities for all concerned, though they existed and were attractive.",
      "The argument was that it would stabilise the turbulent Middle East. The US-Saudi security deal would also be a good way for Washington to outflank the Chinese, whose rise to global power includes a strong interest in the Gulf, its oil, money and strategic position.",
      "But that left the Palestinians. The Saudis wrote and tabled the Arab peace initiative back at the turn of the century. They insist that they were not prepared to trade Palestinian rights to get a deal with Israel and the US before 7 October. But Hamas, and other Palestinians, believed that was happening.",
      "It was the latest sign, they believed that the Palestinian cause had, as the Hamas leader and chief ceasefire negotiator Khalil al Hayya told me in Doha in October last year, \"been forgotten and removed from the table\".",
      "He said they attacked Israel 12 months earlier because \"Palestinian rights aren't being considered by anyone.",
      "\u201cIt was necessary to raise an alarm in the world to tell them that here's a people who have a cause and have demands that must be met. This was a blow to Israel, the Zionist enemy.\"",

      "Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has said already that a peace agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a \"huge priority\" for the president.",
      "In December he told a conservative commentator in the US that it was necessary to \"eliminate these terrorist organisations\", release the hostages and move towards a deal with Riyadh.",
      "He indicated that had Trump not lost the 2020 election to Biden, they would have made the deal by forming a common front against Iran, Saudi Arabia's rival on the other side of the Gulf, rather than \"putting the Palestinian issue right in the centre\".",
      "Remaking the Middle East",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 23:20:52 GMT",
    "summary": "An Indian leader offers a $1m prize for deciphering the Indus script, but the puzzle remains unsolved.",
    "story": [
      "Every week, Rajesh PN Rao, a computer scientist, gets emails from people claiming they've cracked an ancient script that has stumped scholars for generations.",
      "These self-proclaimed codebreakers - ranging from engineers and IT workers to retirees and tax officers - are mostly from India or of Indian origin living abroad. All of them are convinced they've deciphered the script of the Indus Valley Civilisation, a blend of signs and symbols.",
      "\"They claim they've solved it and that the 'case is closed',\" says Mr Rao, Hwang Endowed Professor at the University of Washington and author of peer-reviewed studies on the Indus script.",
      "Adding fuel to the race, MK Stalin, the chief minister of southern India's Tamil Nadu state, recently upped the stakes, announcing a $1m prize for anyone who can crack the code.",
      "The Indus, or Harappan, civilisation - one of the world's earliest urban societies - emerged 5,300 years ago in present-day northwest India and Pakistan. Its austere farmers and traders, living in walled, baked-brick cities, thrived for centuries. Since its discovery a century ago, around 2,000 sites have been uncovered across the region.",
      "The reasons behind the society's sudden decline remain unclear, with no apparent evidence of war, famine or a natural disaster. But its greatest mystery is its undeciphered script, leaving its language, governance and beliefs shrouded in secrecy.",
      "For over a century, experts - linguists, scientists and archaeologists - have tried to crack the Indus script. Theories have linked it to early Brahmi scripts, Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages, Sumerian, and even claimed it's just made up of political or religious symbols.",
      "Yet, its secrets remain locked away. \"The Indus script is perhaps the most important system of writing that is undeciphered,\" says Asko Parpola, a leading Indologist.",
      "These days, the more popular spectacular theories equate the script with content from Hindu scriptures and attribute spiritual and magical meanings to the inscriptions.",
      "Most of these attempts ignore that the script, made up of signs and symbols, mostly appears on stone seals used for trade and commerce, making it unlikely they contain religious or mythological content, according to Mr Rao.",
      "There are many challenges to deciphering the Indus script.",
      "First, the relatively small number of scripts - about 4,000 of them, almost all on small objects such as seals, pottery and tablets.",
      "Then there's the brevity of each script - average length of about five signs or symbols - with no long texts on walls, tablets or upright stone slabs.",
      "Consider the commonly found square seals: lines of signs run along their top, with a central animal motif - often a unicorn - and an object beside it, whose meaning remains unknown.",
      "There's also no bilingual artefact like the Rosetta Stone, which helped scholars decode Egyptian hieroglyphs. Such artefacts contain text in two languages, offering a direct comparison between a known and unknown script.",
      "Recent advancements in deciphering the Indus script have used computer science to tackle this ancient enigma. Researchers have used machine learning techniques to analyse the script, trying to identify patterns and structures that could lead to its understanding.",
      "Nisha Yadav, a researcher at the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), is one of them. In collaboration with scientists like Mr Rao, her work has focused on applying statistical and computational methods to analyse the undeciphered script.",
      "Using a digitised data set of Indus signs from the script,  they have found interesting patterns. A caveat: \"We still don't know whether the signs are complete words, or part of words or part of sentences,\" says Ms Yadav.",
      "Ms Yadav and co-researchers found 67 signs that account for 80% of the writing on the script. A sign which looks like a jar with two handles turned out to be the most frequently used sign. Also, the scripts began with a large number of signs and ended with fewer of them. Some sign patterns appear more often than expected.",
      "Also, a machine-learning model of the script was created to restore the illegible and damaged texts, paving the way for further research.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the script is structured and there is an underlying logic in the writing,\" says Ms Yadav.",
      "To be sure, several ancient scripts remain undeciphered, facing challenges similar to the Indus script.",
      "Mr Rao cites scripts like Proto-Elamite (Iran), Linear A (Crete), and Etruscan (Italy), whose underlying language is unknown.",
      "Others, like Rongorongo (Easter Island) and Zapotec (Mexico), have known languages, \"but their symbols remain unclear\". The Phaistos Disc from Crete - a mysterious, fired clay disc from the Minoan civilisation - \"closely mirrors the Indus script's challenges -  its language is unknown, and only one known example exists\".",
      "Back in India, it is not entirely clear why Mr Stalin of Tamil Nadu announced a reward for deciphering the script. His announcement followed a new study linking Indus Valley signs to graffiti found in his state.",
      "K Rajan and R Sivananthan analysed over 14,000 graffiti-bearing pottery fragments from 140 excavated sites in Tamil Nadu, which included more than 2,000 signs. Many of these signs closely resemble those in the Indus script, with 60% of the signs matching, and over 90% of south Indian graffiti marks having \"parallels\" with those from the Indus civilisation, the researchers claim.",
      "This \"suggests a kind of cultural contact\" between the Indus Valley and south India, Mr Rajan and Mr Sivananthan say.",
      "Many believe Mr Stalin's move to announce an award positions him as a staunch champion of Tamil heritage and culture, countering Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules in Delhi.",
      "But researchers are confident that there will be no claimants for Mr Stalin's prize soon. Scholars have compiled complete, updated databases of all known inscribed artefacts - crucial for decipherment. \"But what did the Indus people write? I wish we knew,\" says Ms Yadav.",

      "It's where investigators think the deadly blaze that destroyed so many homes in the area may have started.",
      "A similar scene is playing out across town in the north of the city. There, the community of Altadena was levelled by a different fire that ignited in the San Gabriel Mountains.",
      "Investigators in both locations are scouring canyons and trails, and examining rocks, bottles, cans \u2013 any debris left behind that might hold clues to the origins of these blazes, which are still unknown.",
      "It's the one thing on-edge and devastated Angelenos are desperate to know: how did these fires start?",
      "Without answers, some in fire-prone California are filling in the gaps themselves. Fingers have been pointed at arsonists, power company utilities or even a blaze days prior in the Pacific Palisades that was snuffed out but may have re-ignited in the face of Santa Ana winds blowing at 80-100mph (128-160 kmph) last week.",
      "Investigators are examining all those theories and more. They're following dozens of leads in the hopes that clues in burn patterns, surveillance footage and testimony from first responders and witnesses can explain why Los Angeles saw two of the most destructive fire disasters in US history ignite on 7 January, so far killing 27 people and destroying more than 12,000 homes and businesses.",

      "In a series of videos posted online, Mr Cranmore and his friends are seen running down the canyon on the morning of 7 January. His first videos show a small cloud of smoke billowing from a hill as they navigate through brush and rock formations in a desperate escape. Out of breath, they comment on having smelled fire before seeing smoke rising.",
      "In further clips, that small cloud gets darker and flames can later be seen cresting over the hilltop.",
      "\"Dude, that's right where we were standing,\" one person exclaims in the video as flames whip in the distance. \"We were literally right there,\" another chimes in.",
      "The videos of the hikers are being examined as part of the official investigation into the origin of the Palisades Fire, Ms Colbrun of the ATF confirmed, saying their experience is just one of many tips and potential leads that have been flagged to authorities.",
      "\"The investigators, they're talking to everyone,\" she said.",
      "Some on the internet were quick to blame the group for the fire, noting how close they were to the blaze when it erupted. Even actor Rob Schneider posted about the hikers, asking his followers to help identify them.",
      "In interviews with US media outlets, members of the hiking group noted how fearful they became as people started online attacks. One of the men said he deleted his social media accounts.",
      "\"It's scary,\" one of the group told the LA Times. \"Just knowing as a matter of fact of our experience that we didn't do it but then seeing the amount of people that have different theories is overwhelming.\"",
      "Ms Colbrun said investigators were also speaking to firefighters who responded to a blaze days earlier that sparked nearby in the same canyon. A persistent theory holds that a small fire on 1 January was never fully extinguished and reignited six days later as winds picked up.",
      "The Palisades Fire is thought to have erupted around 10:30 local time on 7 January, but several hikers told US media they'd smelled smoke earlier that morning as they used the trail.",
      "A security guard who works near the trail told the BBC he'd seen smoke or dust for several days in the area. The morning of the blaze he was patrolling the neighbourhood bordering the canyon and called firefighters as a plume of smoke formed.",
      "But Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone was dismissive of speculation the the two fires in the Palisades, nearly a week apart, could be connected.",
      "\"I don't buy it. Personally, I don't buy it,\" he told the BBC. \"I believe that a week is too long for a fire to get re-established that wasn't fully contained.\" He acknowledged such incidents do happen but they are rare.",
      "While Chief Marrone's agency is not leading the probe into the Palisades Fire, he said investigators were also examining the possibility of arson.",
      "\"We had numerous fires in the LA County region almost simultaneously, which leads us to believe that these fires were intentionally set by a person,\" Chief Marrone said.",

      "The agency is working with Cal Fire, California's state-wide fire agency, to investigate the cause of that blaze and where it ignited.",
      "The Eaton Fire erupted shortly after sunset on 7 January - hours after firefighters became overwhelmed in the Palisades.",
      "Jeffrey Ku captured what could be some of the earliest footage of the fire.",
      "A Ring doorbell camera on his home captured the moment his wife came to pull him outside. \"Hey babe, I need you to come out here right now,\" she tells him as her hair whips in the fierce winds. \"We have a very big problem.\"",
      "\"Oh no!\" Mr Ku can be heard saying as bright orange flames light up the sky.",
      "At that point, the fire was still small. It was blazing under a large metal utility tower on the mountainside.",

      "The large metal utility tower Mr Ku recorded is now a focus for fire investigators.",
      "Utility providers have been blamed for some of California's worst fires, including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise. In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) agreed a $13.5bn (\u00a310.2bn) settlement with victims of the Camp Fire and other wildfires in the state.",
      "In the week since the Eaton Fire, there have already been at least five lawsuits filed against Southern California Edison, the power provider that operates the tower seen in Mr Ku's video.",
      "The company says it has not found any evidence that its equipment was responsible for the fire and is reviewing the lawsuits.",
      "In a statement, it said its preliminary analysis of transmission lines across the canyon showed there were \"no interruptions or operational/electrical anomalies in the 12 hours prior to the fire's reported start time until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire\".",
      "Additionally, the company said its distribution lines to the west of Eaton Canyon \"were de-energized well before the reported start time of the fire\" as part of its fire safety shut-off program.",
      "Chief Marrone told the BBC that investigators were looking into all possibilities, including whether the tower may have been where a spot fire ignited \u2013 meaning the initial blaze could have been started elsewhere but then spread to the tower through flying embers.",
      "He explained the tower where the fire was spotted is not like those seen in neighbourhoods. Rather than a wooden pole with a small, easy-to-blow transformer or slim wires, this was a massive metal transmission tower with high voltage lines as thick as a fist.",
      "These types of lines aren't typically the cause of fires because they're computerised, he said, and the system automatically turns off power once there is an issue.",
      "He noted, though, that investigators were looking into whether Southern California Edison's systems operated properly that night and cut power.",
      "Cal Fire cautioned against casting any blame so early in the probe.",

      "After each postponement or small development, the couple are swamped with calls. Each moment of expectation leads to disappointment in their search for justice.",
      "The family live in the western city of Kisumu - an opposition stronghold where riots broke out in August 2017 amid anger about the results of an election that was eventually re-run because of irregularities.",
      "Their small home was along a road in the Nyalenda informal settlement that witnessed protests on 11 August where anti-riot police were deployed.",
      "That night the couple locked their wooden door and barricaded it with furniture. At around midnight, they heard their neighbours' doors being broken down and some of the occupants being beaten.",
      "It was not long before police officers arrived at their door.",
      "\"They knocked and kicked it several times [but] I refused to open,\" Mr Abanja tells the BBC, adding that he pleaded with them to spare his family of four.",
      "But the battering continued until the officers found a small space through which they threw a tear-gas canister into the one-roomed house, forcing the family out.",
      "Mr Abanja says he was ordered to lie down outside the door and then the beating started.",
      "\"They were going for my head so I held my hands up, and they beat my hands until they could not hold any more.\"",

      "Their quest for justice has been long and frustrating, like that of dozens of others caught up in the post-poll violence.",
      "Twelve police officers have been expected to be charged with murder, rape and torture - but the hearing at which this will happen, when they will be asked to enter a plea, has yet to happen.",
      "One of the victims' lawyers, Willys Otieno, reckons that the delay is due to a lack of political will to deliver justice to victims of election violence.",
      "Uhuru Kenyatta went on to win the election re-run later in 2017 - the opposition candidate withdrew from the contest. His deputy William Ruto, with whom he later fell out, was victorious in the next vote - taking office in September 2022.",
      "\"The state is no longer interested in prosecuting the perpetrators, [and] it is now left to victims' counsels - those of us who work with non-governmental organisations and human rights groups to put pressure for the charges to be registered and the accused persons to go to trial,\" Mr Otieno tells the BBC.",
      "He accuses the current director of public prosecutions (DPP) of \"acting like an attorney of the accused\".",
      "\"It is not even the accused persons who've applied to court for adjournment - it is the DPP who has applied to court to adjourn the plea taking,\" the lawyer said about two failed attempts at taking a plea last October and November.",
      "The third attempt was meant to happen two days ago but was postponed due to the transfer of the presiding judge  - and has been rescheduled for the end of the month.",
      "The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) told the BBC it could not handle a request for comment, but posted on X that \"the case remains one of the most high-profile in recent history, with Baby Pendo's death symbolising the tragic outcomes of police brutality during the 2017 post-election unrest\".",
      "But those involved in the case find the delays troubling.",
      "\"It was the Office of the DPP that initiated this case, and they were the ones that reached out to us several years ago. They asked us to join a victim support group that was essentially established to make sure that they would have witnesses for their case,\" Irungu Houghton, head of the rights group Amnesty International Kenya, tells the BBC.",
      "After initial investigations, the DPP at the time, Nurdin' Hajji, initiated a public inquest into the death of baby Samantha. The judge found the police culpable.",
      "Subsequently, the public prosecutor ordered further investigations into other cases resulting from the police operation of August 2017, and brought in independent constitutional investigative bodies, civil society and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.",
      "The probe uncovered evidence which the DPP said pointed to \"the systematic use of violence, including killing, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, against civilians, all of which constitute serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity\".",

      "In September 2023 a new DPP took office, Renson M Ingonga, but there has been little movement in the case since.",
      "There appears to be \"an unwillingness to try to prosecute this case,\" says Mr Houghton.",

      "2023",
      "7 October: Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launch an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting nearby communities, police stations and army bases. About 1,200 people are killed and 251 hostages taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fires thousands of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military immediately responds with air and artillery strikes on Gaza.",
      "27 October: Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel's massive military campaign will go on to devastate Gaza, displace most of the 2.3 million population, and kill more than 46,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "21 November: A deal brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt sees Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails during a week-long ceasefire. Israel and Hamas blame each other for causing the collapse of the truce.",
      "28 December: Shuttle diplomacy on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal starts.",
      "2024",
      "31 May: US President Joe Biden outlines an Israeli proposal for a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. It forms the basis of the deal that is agreed upon eight months later.",
      "10 June: The United Nations Security Council passes a resolution supporting the ceasefire plan.",
      "31 July: The talks are suspended following Israel's assassination of Hamas political leader and chief negotiator Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Tehran. Discussions resume two weeks later, initially in the absence of Hamas.",
      "17 October: Israeli forces kill Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza. Netanyahu calls it the \"beginning of the end\" of the war.",
      "9 November: After months without a breakthrough, Qatar suspends its efforts as mediator in the negotiations. It says Israel and Hamas need to shift their positions. Both sides blame each other for the impasse.",
      "20 November: The US vetoes a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, saying it \"abandoned\" the necessity for there to be \"a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages\".",
      "27 November: Israel agrees a ceasefire with Lebanon to end a 13-month conflict with the armed group Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, which was triggered by the Gaza war. It reignites hope for a deal in Gaza, with Biden saying he will make another push with regional powers.",
      "2 December: US President-elect Donald Trump says there will be \"all hell to pay\" if the hostages still held in Gaza are not released by the time he returns to the White House on 20 January 2025.",

    "story": [
      "A senior Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three female soldiers on the first day of the ceasefire. Mediators in Doha are trying an earlier start to the ceasefire, Thursday evening instead of Sunday.",
      "Until the ceasefire does come into effect, the war that started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 goes on. At least 12 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza around the time the ceasefire was announced.",
      "In what has been at times even an hourly ritual over the last 15 months, video has come out of northern Gaza showing their bodies being carried out of ambulances in sheets and laid out in a line outside a hospital.",
      "The ceasefire is a considerable diplomatic achievement. It's long overdue. Versions of the deal have been on the table since it was announced by US President Joe Biden in May last year. Hamas and Israel have blamed each other for the delays.",
      "Gaza ceasefire deal reached by Israel and Hamas",
      "What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained",
      "In Khan Younis in Gaza, journalists working for the BBC filmed Palestinians dancing and chanting as it became clear that the ceasefire had been agreed.",
      "Israel does not allow international journalists to enter Gaza to report freely, so the BBC and other news organisations rely on valiant Palestinian journalists to gather news for us. Reporting of the last 15 months of war would have been impossible without them. Israel has killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists in Gaza.",
      "Umm Muhammad, an elderly Palestinian woman, told one of our journalists she felt happy and relieved.",
      "\"The pain has disappeared a bit, though it's still there. Hopefully it will be overcome by joy. Let our prisoners get freed and the injured get treated. People are exhausted.\"",
      "Apart from survival there is not much to celebrate for Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has killed almost 50,000 people at least. More than two million people have been forced out of their homes by Israeli military action.",
      "Israel's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that killed around 1200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, has left Gaza in ruins. According to the Hamas run health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed almost 50,000 people, both combatants and civilians. A recent study in the Lancet medical journal says that might be a major underestimate.",
      "In Tel Aviv, it was also a bittersweet moment for the families and supporters of Israeli hostages, living and dead. In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 women, older men and the sick and wounded are due for release in the next six weeks in return for hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners \u2013 but the future of the rest of the hostages depends on more negotiations.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the agreement, to free the remaining Israeli hostages in return for imprisoned Palestinians and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza are due to start 16 days into the agreement.",
      "The first big challenge is making sure that the ceasefire holds. Senior western diplomats fear that after the first phase of 42 days the war could resume.",
      "The Gaza war has had immense consequences across the Middle East. It did not, as many feared, lead to a general war in the region \u2013 the Biden Administration has claimed credit for that \u2013 but it has led to geostrategic upheaval.",
      "Hamas is still able to fight but it is a shadow of what it was. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister have been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. The International Court of Justice is investigating a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "After Hezbollah in Lebanon intervened in the war, it was, eventually, crushed by an Israeli offensive. That was a factor that led to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. Iran and Israel exchanged direct attacks \u2013 weakening Iran. Its network of allies and proxies that Tehran called the Axis of Resistance has been crippled.",
      "The Houthis in Yemen have halted much of the shipping between Europe and Asia that passes the Red Sea. Now reports say that they have announced their own ceasefire. Since they started attacking shipping early in the war they have said that only a ceasefire in Gaza would stop them.",
      "With luck, political will and hard diplomatic effort the ceasefire will hold despite inevitable violations. With luck, it can stop the killing and get Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees and prisoners back to their families.",
      "But after 15 months of war in Gaza, the conflict which has lasted more than a century is as bitter and intractable as ever.",
      "The ceasefire doesn't end the conflict. The consequences of so much destruction and death will be felt for a generation, at least."

    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute.

      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 16:55:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also both represented by agency WME, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",
      "The surprise hit film has made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:36:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Bob Uecker was the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame.",
    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2025 21:59:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "story": [
      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",

      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients.

    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "The plants \u2014 located in New Castle, Indiana; Forrest City, Arkansas; and Peterburg, Virginia \u2014 were cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for issues such as mold on ceilings, floors and walls, \"unidentified slime\" and \"an abundance of insects.\" The problems cited by USDA inspectors at the three plants date back as far as 2019, according to the documents.",
      "Boar's Head didn't immediately respond to a request from CBS News for comment.

    "summary": "Officials have blamed a new strain for this winter's surge in norovirus cases.",
    "story": [
      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",
      "That new strain has been spotted everywhere around the country, including in many cruise ship outbreaks, a CDC official told CBS News. Lower population immunity to GII.17[P17] could explain this year's unusual wave of the virus.",

      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",

      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "The court's opinion comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have said that TikTok has for years raised national security concerns. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",

    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",

      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",

    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a relatively strong economy when he's inaugurated. Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "Some Walmart shareholders say the retailer hasn't offered a good business case for canceling its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of shareholders representing $266 billion in assets are calling on Walmart to spell out the business reasons for backpedaling on the retailer's\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Investors including Amalgamated Bank and Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids said Tuesday in a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that they are \"concerned to see our company give into bullying and pressure from anti-DEI groups.\"",
      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",
      "Organized by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition that seeks to influence corporate behavior, the investors requested a meeting with Walmart leaders about the change in policy, noting they had for decades supplied data illustrating the business hazards linked to discrimination and inequity.",
      "\"Seeing the company retreat from its stated values and the business opportunities associated with a diverse and inclusive workforce is very disheartening. Additionally, Walmart has not offered a financial or business case for this change in policy,\" the investors wrote.",
      "Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The letter coincides with\u00a0another by a coalition of 14 attorneys general also\u00a0voicing concerns about Walmart's DEI announcement, made weeks after the November win at the polls by President-elect Donald Trump, a vocal opponent of DEI policies.",
      "Other companies have also moved to unwind their DEI efforts in recent weeks. Meta last week said it would pull the plug on its DEI programs, joining other corporate giants to make the move, including\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald's. The retrenchment accelerated in 2023 after the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions, a decision that emboldened anti-DEI activists.",
      "Other large companies to shut down their DEI programs include motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, hardware chain Lowe's, and farm equipment manufacturers John Deere and actor Supply.",
      "Still, mamor companies including \u00a0Apple, Costco and\u00a0Target\u00a0continue to support their DEI policies. Target, for instance, is defending against itself in court against a conservative advocacy group's lawsuit\u00a0claiming\u00a0the retailer misled investors about the alleged financial risks stemming from its DEI practices.",
      "Jeff Raikes, a Costco board member, has touted the economic benefits of diverse workplaces,\u00a0posting\u00a0on social media in November that \"attacks on DEI aren't just bad for business \u2014 they hurt our economy. A diverse workforce drives innovation, expands markets and fuels growth.\"",
      "Costco's board is recommending that shareholders vote against a\u00a0proposal\u00a0to dismantle its DEI program ahead of a Jan. 23 investor meeting amid calls by activists\u00a0such as Robby Starbuck\u00a0urging boycotts of the warehouse club.",

    "summary": "Scott Bessent, tapped by Donald Trump to be treasury secretary, faced sharp questions from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

Met with a round of applause at the NCAA's convention in Nashville, Tennessee, the unanimous vote was the final buzzer-beater in establishing a pay structure for women competing in March Madness.",
      "The change comes as men's basketball teams have been a part of revenue-sharing plans for years. But with a surge in popularity surrounding women's basketball, the NCAA's Board of Governors voted unanimously for the proposal in August. Wednesday's vote solidified the details.",
      "Starting in the 2025 season, a combined $15 million will be awarded to the teams, which makes up 26% of the women's basketball media revenue deal. It will increase to $20 million for the 2026-27 fiscal year and reach $25 million starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",
      "\"This is a historic day for women's sports, women's basketball and the NCAA,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"We have made investing in women's sports a priority, and today's vote means our members have the opportunity to do even more on campus to promote and support female athletes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",

It also outdrew the men's national championship game by 3 million viewers.",
      "Viewing records were set across all six rounds as fans watched outstanding players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark take on South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and the undefeated Gamecocks.

      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",
      "\"It's capitalizing on the momentum that's out there,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a statement that they made today about where women's basketball fits into the big picture of college athletics.\"",

Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",
      "Here, Republicans have more faith in Trump's abilities \u2014 about 7 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy in general.",
      "Health care costs",
      "But there are other policy areas where expectations for Trump aren't high across the board. Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",
      "About 6 in 10 Democrats think Trump will be a terrible president in his second term, down from three-quarters who said he was a terrible president at the end of his first term.",
      "The AP-NORC poll of 1,147 adults was conducted Jan. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:10:56 -0500",
    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:59:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Insurance companies are canceling homeowner policies across the U.S. \u2014 even in regions that aren't considered climate hot spots.",
    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",

      "Walgreens and other retailers have had to combat so-called \"retail shrink,\" or the loss of inventory from causes other than sales, Wentworth noted. The company took steps to secure more products after it found retail theft accounted for a rising share of shrink. However, locking products behind plastic has not proved effective, he said.",
      "The company's asset protection division is developing \"creative\" solutions to fight retail theft, Wentworth said Tuesday.",
      "\"I don't have anything magnificent to share with you today. It is a hand-to-hand combat battle still, unfortunately,\" Wentworth said.",
      "The company reported an operating loss of $245 million for the quarter, compared to $39 million for the same quarter one year earlier.",
      "Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales. It has already closed roughly 2,000 locations over the past decade and has \"a lot of experience with store closures,\" the company said.",
      "\"Naturally, we expect our future footprint to support stronger performance,\" Wentworth said.",

    "summary": "Inflation is proving stickier than expected, which could cause Fed to hit pause button on more interest rate cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation rose 2.9% on an annual basis in December, with the latest Consumer Price Index illustrating the Federal Reserve's challenge in battling stickier-than-expected price increases.",
      "Last month's CPI was forecast to come in at 2.8%, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "Still, there are some signs of progress in the Fed's inflation battle. Core CPI, or prices excluding the volatile energy and food costs, rose 3.2% on an annual basis, lower than the 3.3% rate expected by economists. It also marked the smallest increase in core CPI since July 2024, according to PNC Financial Services Group.",
      "The Federal Reserve began cutting rates in September following a flurry of hikes that helped tame inflation after it hit a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. Yet the Fed has struggled with the last leg of its inflation battle in pushing the CPI to a 2% annual rate, and December's reading could convince the central bank to hold off on another rate cut at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 29.",
      "Good signs on inflation",
      "The cooler-than-expected core CPI data reassured Wall Street that inflation isn't on a renewed upward trend, according to economists at High Frequency Economics in a research note. Stock gained on Wednesday morning, with the S&P 500 rising 95 points, or 1.6%, to 5,937 in early trading.",
      "\"There surely is no evidence of either a crash in prices \u2014 as one might expect to see in a crashing economy \u2014 or a renewal of upward pressure on prices,\" they wrote.",
      "Signs that underlying inflation pressures are easing sent stocks rocketing higher on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 703 points, or 1.7%, to close at 43,221, while the S&P 500 gained 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 2.5%.",
      "Given the mixed inflation data, some economists predicted the Fed is likely to hold off on a rate hike at its Jan. 29 meeting, although they added that the improvement in the core CPI bolsters the possibility of cuts later in 2025.",
      "\"After recent red-hot data, today's softer-than-expected core CPI reading should help cool fears of a reacceleration in inflation,\" said Tina Adatia, head of fixed income client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"While today's release is likely insufficient to put a January rate cut back on the table, it strengthens the case that the Fed's cutting cycle has not yet run its course.\"",
      "At the same time, economists are expressing concern about the incoming Trump administration's economic plans \u2014 a mix of new tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations \u2014 which they say could reignite inflation.",
      "That could come as consumers are continuing to feel the pinch of higher costs. Prices in December accelerated due to higher gasoline prices, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing, according to the report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "While Wall Street is interpreting the December report favorably, the CPI report signals \"little relief to most consumers,\" noted David Royal, chief financial and investment officer at financial services company Thrivent, in an email. \"Food prices, which had been tame in the first half of 2024, continued their acceleration, increasing 0.3% in December.\"",
      "He added, \"[T]he increases in prices of items closely watched by consumers could continue to be a drag on consumer confidence, which has already shown weakness on inflation concerns.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging the X owner misled shareholders about his Twitter stock purchases in 2022.",
      "The suit alleges Musk violated federal securities laws, enabling him to purchase shares of Twitter at artificially low prices before his $44 billion takeover of the social media site. Musk has called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"",
      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",
      "Musk waited until April 4, 2022, 11 days after the report was due, to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership in an SEC report, the commission says.",
      "\"Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,\" the SEC alleges in its suit.",
      "The SEC says it wants the court to order Musk to pay \"disgorgement of unjust enrichment as a result of his violation.\" The SEC is also seeking civil penalties.",
      "Musk responded to news of the suit on X on Tuesday night, calling the SEC a \"totally broken organization.\"",
      "\"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk wrote.",

      "In July 2022, Musk\u00a0tried to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter, but the company sued to hold him to their agreement, and\u00a0he completed the takeover in October of that year.",
      "Musk has tangled with the SEC before. The SEC in 2018 filed a complaint alleging that Musk had misled Tesla investors. In 2023, the SEC said it was seeking a court order to compel Musk to testify as part of its investigation into his purchase of X. He later testified for the investigation.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 18:45:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

Municipal resources, like fire hydrants, have run dry in some areas.",
      "Those who can afford to do so are reaching out to private firefighting crews in hopes of saving their homes from the furious wildfires.",

      "Some of the company's firefighters also work for county fire departments. Others are retired from active duty, according to the company, which offers different levels of protective services ranging in price from $2,500 to $14,000.",
      "Clients called on All Risk Shield before the fires reached their properties to try and protect their homes from encroaching flames.",
      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",
      "\"The size and scale of these fires and the devastation left in their wake require an all-hands-on-deck approach to suppression, restoration and future prevention, including state, federal and private resources,\" the NWSA said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Meta plans to cut 5% of its workforce, or about 3,600 workers, with the social media giant focusing on eliminating low-performing employees.",
      "The layoffs, earlier reported by Bloomberg News, were confirmed by Meta, which had about 72,400 employees as of Sept. 30. In a memo published by Bloomberg and confirmed by Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's plan reflects the anticipation of an \"intense year\" that will focus on technology such as artificial intelligence and smart glasses.",
      "\"I've decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the memo.",
      "The decision to cut low-performing employees comes at a time when Meta is undergoing a transformation, opting to end its fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to that used by\u00a0Elon Musk's X. In curtailing its fact-checking program, Zuckerberg cited the 2024 U.S. presidential election as an underlying reason for the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point.\"",
      "Meta is also ending its key diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, joining other corporate giants like\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0that have pulled the plug on their diversity initiatives.",

      "U.S. wholesale inflation rose last month on higher energy prices.",
      "The Labor Department reported Tuesday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.2% last month from November, down from a 0.4% gain the month before. Compared with a year earlier, producer prices rose 3.3%, biggest jump since February 2023 and up from a 3% gain in November.",
      "A 3.5% November-to-December increase in energy prices \u2014 led by a 9.7% increase in gasoline prices \u2014 pushed the overall index higher. Food prices dipped 0.1% in December.",
      "Still, the overall increases were slightly less than economists had forecast. U.S. markets leapt higher immediately on the new inflation data.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% in early trading Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 163 points, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher.",
      "Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was unchanged from November but up 3.5% from a year earlier.",
      "The producer price report came out a day before the Labor Department reports on consumer prices. Its consumer price index is expected to rise 0.3% from November and 2.8% from December 2023, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.",
      "In response, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate \u2014 the fed funds rate \u2014 11 times in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Inflation came down from the four-decade highs it reached in mid-2022, giving the Fed enough confidence to reverse course and cut rates three times in 2024. But the progress on inflation has stalled in recent months, and year-over-year increases in consumer prices remain above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "Fed to exercise caution",
      "Fed officials signaled in December that they planned to be more cautious about cutting rates this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they forecast back in September. They are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at their next meeting Jan. 28-29.",
      "Many economists are worried that President-elect Donald Trump's promises to impose tariffs on foreign goods and cut taxes will push inflation higher.",
      "\"The Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower, sooner, in today's figures,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"Better-than-expected is not what necessarily what the Fed wants to see before easing monetary conditions into a fast-growing economy, with tariffs and tax cuts on the agenda of the incoming administration.''",

      "Wealthy Trump ally and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was also floated as a possibility for the job. Trump tapped him to co-lead the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" a new advisory body meant to tackle federal spending and waste. Ramaswamy has been largely quiet after he took to social media in December to criticize U.S. culture as venerating \"mediocrity\" and seemed to suggest Americans are lazy, prompting backlash.",
      "\"More movies like 'Whiplash,' fewer reruns of 'Friends,'\" Ramaswamy, 39, complained on X in December. \"More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers. More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons. More books, less TV. More creating, less 'chillin.' More extracurriculars, less 'hanging out at the mall.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the sprawling Department of Homeland Security, is fielding questions from lawmakers on Friday at her Senate confirmation hearing.",
      "She is appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, which has jurisdiction over the DHS and those nominated to lead the department.",
      "\"As we face the evolving threats of the 21st century, the mission and the success of DHS is more critical than ever. We must be vigilant and proactive and innovative to protect the homeland,\" she said in her opening statement. \"The challenges in front of us are extremely significant, and we must secure our borders against illegal trafficking and immigration.\"",
      "Noem, a former Republican member of Congress who has been South Dakota's governor since 2019, was expected to be asked about the incoming Trump administration's sweeping immigration plans, which include a promised mass deportation operation.",
      "DHS oversees airport security, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other responsibilities. The queston of FEMA funding came up early in the hearing when Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut raised the California wildfires. He expressed dismay about Trump's comments about the fires \u2014 and the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. He noted the president-elect said recently, \"We won't give him, referring to Gov. Newsom, money to put out fires, and if we don't give him money, he's got a problem,\" and asked Noem if she would say \"no\" to Trump if he tried to withhold aid to California or any other state for political reasons.",
      "While Noem did not address the question about Trump, she assured Blumenthal, \"Under my leadership of the Department of Homeland Security, there will be no political bias to how disaster relief is delivered to the American people.\"",
      "\"I will deliver the programs according to the law, and it will be done with no political bias,\" she said.",
      "The department also houses the three main federal immigration agencies that will play a key role in implementing Trump's immigration agenda: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "When announcing her nomination as DHS secretary soon after the election, Trump noted that Noem dispatched the South Dakota National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to help Texas state officials fortify it amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "If confirmed as DHS secretary, Noem would likely play an important role in shaping the second Trump administration's planned changes to U.S. immigration and border policy, alongside incoming border czar Tom Homan and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Republicans control a majority in the Senate, making her confirmation likely.",
      "During the hearing, GOP senators asked Noem about an app introduced by the Biden administration, called CBP One, to allow migrants to set up an appointment at international bridges, where U.S. officials determine whether they should be allowed into the country to request asylum. It's been used millions of times to help process claims more quickly. Many Republicans oppose its use and asked about Noem's plans for the app.",
      "\"Will you use your authority to stop facilitating faster processing of illegal aliens into our country with the CBP One app,\" GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma asked.",
      "\"Yes, Senator,\" Noem responded. \"We will eliminate the CBP One app \u2014 maintain some of the data that's in it that's critical to knowing who's in our country \u2014 but that app will no longer be in use.\"",
      "Among other promises, Trump and his advisers have vowed to reverse Biden administration immigration programs, enact harsher rules at the U.S.-Mexico border, scale back refugee admissions and dramatically ramp deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally. The president-elect has also pledged to upend the longstanding principle of birthright citizenship, in a bid to prevent children born to unauthorized immigrants from becoming American citizens at birth.",
      "Considered a Trump loyalist, Noem has been praised by conservatives for her record as governor, which includes vocally opposing mask mandates and other COVID-era measures. But she's also garnered detractors. Tribal nations in South Dakota, for example, have banned her from their lands over comments she's made alleging cartel activity in tribal territory.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a new law that would lead to a ban of the social media platform TikTok, clearing the way for the widely popular app to shutter in the U.S. as soon as Sunday.",
      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "The court's opinion comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have said that TikTok has for years raised national security concerns. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",
      "\"I had a very good experience with TikTok,\" he said.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida resort, in December, and is expected to attend the president-elect's inauguration Monday.",
      "Trump also spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by phone Friday, Trump wrote on\u00a0Truth Social. TikTok was one of the issues they discussed, he said.",

    "summary": "President Biden says he's commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. That gives him the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden announced Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, using his final days in office on a flurry of clemency actions meant to nullify prison terms he deemed too harsh.",
      "The recent round of clemency gives Mr. Biden the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. The Democrat said he's seeking to undo \"disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice.\"",
      "\"Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately release the names of those receiving commutations.",
      "Still, Mr. Biden said more could yet be coming, promising to use the time before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to \"continue to review additional commutations and pardons.\"",
      "Friday's action follows Mr. Biden's commutations last month of the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the pardoning of 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. That was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.",
      "All of this comes as Mr. Biden continues to weigh whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by Trump's administration. Though presidential pardoning powers are absolute, such a preemptive move would be a novel and risky use of the president's extraordinary constitutional power.",
      "Last month, he also commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. Trump has vowed to roll back that order after his term begins.",
      "Mr. Biden also recently pardoned his son Hunter, not just for his convictions on federal gun and tax violations but for any potential federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president feared Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other offenses.",
      "If history is any guide, meanwhile, Mr. Biden also is likely to issue more targeted pardons to help allies before leaving the White House, as presidents typically do in some of their final actions.",
      "Just before midnight on the final night of his first term, Trump, a Republican, signed a flurry of pardons and commutations for more than 140 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black and former members of Congress.",
      "Trump's final act as president in his first term was to announce a pardon for Al Pirro, ex-husband of Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro, one of his staunchest defenders. Al Pirro was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion charges and sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2000.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 05:00:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a relatively strong economy when he's inaugurated. Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas is allowing three other states to pursue a challenge seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.",
      "The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill's approval.",
      "The states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.",
      "That's because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills \"undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\" according to court documents.",
      "Meanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn't be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they're outside the state.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue.",
      "Kacsmaryk's decision \"has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,\" the ACLU said.",
      "The ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he's also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "In the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Previously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000.",
      "Yet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.",
      "But while the states' leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.",
      "Across the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks \u2014 before women often know they're pregnant.",
      "Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.",
      "Mifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",

    "summary": "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.",
    "story": [
      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to install Texas' border czar as head of U.S. Border Patrol, replacing the career official who currently leads the agency in charge of stopping the illicit movement of migrants and drugs.",
      "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"",
      "Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.",
      "A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges.",
      "It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.",
      "As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.",
      "One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.",
      "Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Thursday that it may announce opinions on Friday morning, a last-minute addition to the schedule that comes just two days before a law that would ban TikTok is set to go into effect.",
      "\"The Court may announce opinions on the homepage beginning at 10 a.m.,\" a notice on the\u00a0court's website said, without specifying what case or cases might be decided. \"The Court will not take the Bench.\"",
      "The law would cut TikTok off from U.S. app stores and hosting services if it does not cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, before the Jan. 19 deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court seemed likely to upload the law when it heard arguments over TikTok's legal challenge last week, with the justices seeming sympathetic to the government's claims that China could use TikTok to collect a vast amount of data on its American users and spy on them.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the potential Supreme Court decision is \"enormously consequential\" for the platform's 170 million users in the U.S. and their free speech rights.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Sunday, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said last week. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "In April, Congress swiftly passed the bipartisan legislation, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as part of a foreign aid package, and it was signed into law by President Biden. It gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, with the possibility of a 90-day extension if a sale were in progress by the January deadline. Absent a sale, TikTok loses access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S.",
      "The law would take effect one day before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump, who attempted to prohibit the app during his first term over national security concerns, has since said he wants to \"save\" the app and has credited it with helping him win over more youth voters.",
      "\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday. \"It's been a great platform for him and his campaign.\"",
      "Some lawmakers are also pushing for a delay in the law's implementation. Two Democratic senators said Thursday they sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to trigger a provision in the measure to delay it for another 90 days, despite no apparent sale being in progress.",
      "\"It's time to take a breath, try to step back, buy some time, try to figure this out rationally. But in no way should we have TikTok go dark,\" Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said Thursday. \"It would be catastrophic with just so many small businesses, so many creators, so many communities that have been created with no alternative available.\"",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge\u00a0in May that called the law \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "A federal appeals court issued a ruling in December that upheld the law, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" A week later, the appeals court denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "On Dec. 16, TikTok asked the Supreme Court for a temporary pause, saying it would suffer \"immediate irreparable harm\" if the high court did not delay the ban. Two days later, the Supreme Court said it would take up the challenge to the law under an expedited timeline.",

      "Under Florida law, it's up to the governor to pick a U.S. Senate seat replacement after Rubio was\u00a0tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be his next secretary of state. Moody will serve as senator until the next general election in 2026 when the seat returns to the ballot.",
      "On Thursday, DeSantis praised Moody as a key player in his political battles, a \"law and order\" prosecutor who is prepared to help Trump \"secure and shut the border,\" hinder inflation and overhaul what the Florida governor described as a federal bureaucracy that has \"run amok.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for [President-elect] Trump to deliver his America First agenda on day one,\" Moody said.",
      "\"The only way to return this country to the people, the people who govern it, is to make sure we have a strong Congress doing its job, passing laws and actually approving the regulations that these unelected bureaucrats are trying to cram down on the American people,\" Moody added.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Moody and why her appointment is significant:",
      "Florida through and through",
      "Moody, 49, is a fifth-generation Floridian who was born and raised in Plant City, a suburb of Tampa. She is also a three-time graduate of the University of Florida, earning her bachelor's and master's degrees in accounting and law, along with her Juris Doctor.",
      "She also earned a master's in international law from the College of Law at Stetson University. In her youth, Moody was named \"queen\" of her hometown's\u00a0Florida Strawberry Festival in 1993.",
      "Moody and her husband, Justin Duralia, the deputy chief of the Plant City Police Department, share two sons.",
      "Career in Florida law and the courts system",
      "Moody\u00a0began her career with the law firm Holland & Knight, where she practiced commercial litigation.",
      "In her spare time, she volunteered to assist domestic violence victims seeking protection in court, according to her biography on the Florida attorney general's website.",
      "She then went on to join the U.S. Attorney General's Office in the Middle District of Florida, the federal court in the 11th Circuit, where she prosecuted drug, firearm and fraud offenses. During her time as a federal prosecutor, Moody was commended by federal agencies for her \"prosecutorial excellence\" and initiative in drug law enforcement, DeSantis said.",
      "She was also recognized by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for leading \"Operation Round-Up,\" a targeted prosecution of violent and repeat offenders.",
      "At the age of 31, Moody became the youngest judge in Florida history when she was elected as Circuit Court judge of the Thirteenth Judicial District in Hillsborough County.",
      "During her time as judge, she founded the Attorney Ad Litem program, recruiting volunteer attorneys to stand in the place of parents who did not appear in court with their children. Moody also developed a mentoring program for at-risk children within the juvenile delinquency system.",
      "From prosecutor to politician",
      "Moody was elected Florida attorney general in 2018, defeating state Rep. Sean Shaw and succeeding Pam Bondi, who is now going through confirmation hearings as Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general. During her campaign, Moody pledged to voters that she would be a prosecutor and not a politician.",
      "As the state's attorney general, Moody was instrumental in defending DeSantis' conservative agenda in court, joining and leading other Republican states' challenges to policies enacted by the Biden administration.",
      "Along with DeSantis, Moody boosted her political profile during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling on the U.S. to \"hold China accountable\" for the outbreak.  She has also sued the Biden administration over several issues, including changes to immigration law enforcement, student loan forgiveness and employer COVID-19 vaccination mandates.",
      "\"I'm happy to say we've had an attorney general that is somebody that has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" DeSantis said. \"We in Florida established our state as a beachhead of liberty, as the free state of Florida. And she was with us every step of the way.\"",
      "Moody was also among the state attorneys general to sign on to the lawsuit backed by Trump that was aimed at overturning Joe Biden's election victory in 2020.",
      "In the past year, Moody has filed lawsuits and joined lawsuits to take on the \"weaponization of law enforcement\" that targeted Trump, taking on special counsel Jack Smith and the New York Attorney General's Office with their cases against the then-former president.",
      "DeSantis said Moody also played an \"integral part\" in Florida's efforts to defend the state from China and its influence, particularly in the controversy surrounding a law that prevented people \"domiciled\" in China from purchasing Florida land, state pension investments in Chinese companies and alleged Chinese espionage through social media.",
      "Moody also led Florida's investigation into the second assassination attempt on Trump in Palm Beach County in September of 2024.",
      "During the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Moody fought against FEMA after reports came out that an agency director allegedly told agents to deny aiding and helping Trump supporters who were impacted by Hurricane Milton in Central Florida.",
      "Moody also fought unsuccessfully to keep Amendment 4 \u2014 Florida's abortion access measure \u2014 off the 2024 ballot, saying proponents were waging \"a war\" to protect the procedure. The amendment did go before voters in November but failed to obtain the 60% approval needed to pass.",
      "Moody's appointment to the U.S. Senate opens up a vacancy in Florida's Cabinet, giving DeSantis another shot at expanding his influence in the state.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump wants to make Hollywood \"bigger, better and stronger\" and has cast Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone as stars of what he is calling his \"Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the President-elect announced on his social media site that the three actors would be his eyes and ears to the moviemaking town.",
      "\"It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He also called the trio special envoys. Special ambassadors and envoys are typically chosen to respond to troubled hot spots like the Middle East, not California.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday, Gibson said he \"got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call. My duty as a citizen is to give any help and insight I can. Any chance the position comes with an Ambassador's residence?\"",
      "Gibson's Malibu home was destroyed in the wildfires which scorched the Los Angeles area.",
      "U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and, in the past week, the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% from 2021, according to data from ProdPro.",
      "In the greater L.A. area, productions were down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, the lowest since 2020. This past October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding California's Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million. Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have used tax incentives to lure film and TV productions to their cities. Actor Mark Wahlberg is even making plans for a Las Vegas production hub.",
      "It's unclear what exactly Gibson, Voight and Stallone will be doing in this effort to bring productions back to the U.S. Representatives for Voight and Stallone did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
      "Trump's decision to select the actors as his chosen \"ambassadors\" underscores his preoccupations with the 1980s and '90s, when he was a rising tabloid star in New York, and Gibson and Stallone were among the biggest movie stars in the world.",
      "Stallone is a frequent guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and introduced him at a gala in November shortly after the election.",
      "\"When George Washington defended his country, he had no idea that he was going to change the world. Because without him, you could imagine what the world would look like,\" Stallone told the crowd. \"Guess what? We got the second George Washington. Congratulations!\"",
      "The decision also reflects Trump's willingness to overlook his supporters' most controversial statements.",
      "Gibson's reputation has been altered in Hollywood since 2006, when he went on an antisemitic rant while being arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. But he's also continued to work in mainstream movies and directed the upcoming Wahlberg thriller \"Flight Risk.\"",

    "summary": "Scott Bessent, tapped by Donald Trump to be treasury secretary, faced sharp questions from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

      "That's because more than four years after the Capitol riot, a new dispute is emerging over a plaque to honor the heroes and victims of the assault. A 2022 law passed by Congress, and signed by President Biden, required a plaque to be placed on the west front of the Capitol complex by March 2023. Republican House leaders, all of whom are closely aligned with Trump, have yet to erect the plaque, nor have they offered any timetable to do so.",
      "Here's a photo of the plaque, which has been completed and has been for some time, according to three Democratic U.S. House sources.",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a group of nearly 60 House Democrats wrote, \"As Members of Congress, we owe a debt of gratitude to these brave officers who defended the Capitol and allowed us to get to safety. We request an update from you regarding your timeline for following the law and placing this plaque.\"",
      "Among the House Democrats pressing for the plaque is Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado who was among those trapped in the upper level of the House Chamber as rioters laid siege to the Capitol. Crow and colleagues wrote to Johnson, \"Every day Congress fails to live up to our promised actions, we do a disservice to our men and women in uniform who help protect members of Congress, congressional staff, our constituents, and the American people.\"",
      "Other Democrats who have signed the letter to Johnson include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, some members of the House Jan. 6 select committee and other Democrats who were trapped in close proximity to the violent mob.",
      "Asked by CBS News Thursday whether the plaque would be installed, Johnson responded, \"You know, I haven't even looked at that. I need to check on it.\"",
      "The letter from House Democrats said a House administrator had testified that the \"plaque was complete,\" and said its placement \"continues to await action from Speaker Johnson.\"",
      "More than 140 police officers were injured during the Capitol attack. Several others died by suicide in the days after the riot.",
      "Several Democrats and staffers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have accused Republicans of bowing to Trump by downplaying or ignoring the violence of the siege. Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. House seat in Maryland as a Democrat last year, told CBS News, \"Speaker Johnson has not and cannot provide any reason.\"",
      "\"At this point he is doing nothing but obstructing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Democrats have been pressing House leaders about the plaque delay for months without success. In May, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who was on the House Jan. 6 select committee investigating the assault, wrote to Johnson for answers about the \"failure to install the plaque.\"",
      "Lofgren told CBS News, \"I sent Speaker Johnson a polite letter inquiring about the delay last May, and he never answered. My office followed up, and we were first referred to a vague press answer. Then, crickets\"",
      "Rep. Joe Morelle, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, told CBS News, \"The plaque should be installed as required by law. Refusing to display the Jan. 6 plaque is part of the denialism that Republicans have made a central part of their being: deny Jan. 6 happened and the harm it caused to the U.S. Capitol Police force and our American democracy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Quietly, just before the calendar turned for the new year, an already whopping debt tentatively owed by President-elect Donald Trump and co-defendants in his New York civil fraud case hit an eye-popping, interest-accumulating milestone: half a billion dollars.",
      "Trump, two of his sons and a former executive at his company were ordered in February 2024 to pay $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years. The figure, which was then $464 million, continued to accrue more than $114,000 in interest per day. The judgment is on appeal.",
      "The total crossed $500 million on Dec. 29, and stands at more than $502 million on Thursday, a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James confirmed.",
      "Trump, who would personally owe about $490 million of that sum, has banked on a reprieve from New York's mid-level Appellate Division, First Department court. During arguments in September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",
      "But as the defendants await the panel's decision, which is expected early this year, interest has continued to pile up. The court typically releases opinions on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and the Trump case was not among the batch released today.",
      "That means Trump will likely be sworn in as president on Monday with a debt to the state of New York larger than the combined proposed 2025 budgets for New York's sixth and seventh largest cities, Albany and New Rochelle.",
      "Trump has raged against the debt and the case, in which a judge concluded he and his company manipulated spreadsheets provided to accountants to juice valuations provided to banks and insurers. The result, James' office argued and Judge Arthur Engoron concluded, was that Trump and his company received more favorable terms on loans and insurance deals that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.",
      "The growing total they may owe the state, known as disgorgement, is equal to the amount Engoron concluded they profited through the scheme, plus interest.",
      "During a later 2023 bench trial in the case, Trump was called to the stand, where he cast blame on his employees and outside accountants, but said his books were compiled accurately. He claimed that, far from overvaluing his assets and net worth, his company \"underestimated\" them.",
      "On top of the half billion owed in the New York civil case, Trump also owes more than $88 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll, after jurors in 2023 and 2024 found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "He has denied all allegations in the New York and Carroll cases, and is pursuing appeals in all three.",

Less than half of Republicans are at least \"very\" confident that Trump will make progress on lowering food costs, housing costs or health care costs, although about 6 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to create jobs.",
      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",
      "Here, Republicans have more faith in Trump's abilities \u2014 about 7 in 10 are at least \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy in general.",
      "Health care costs",
      "But there are other policy areas where expectations for Trump aren't high across the board. Similar to the economy and jobs, about one-third of Americans are at least \"very\" confident in Trump's ability to handle immigration and national security, while about 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident and about half are \"slightly\" or \"not at all\" confident.",
      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",
      "About 6 in 10 Democrats think Trump will be a terrible president in his second term, down from three-quarters who said he was a terrible president at the end of his first term.",
      "The AP-NORC poll of 1,147 adults was conducted Jan. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

    "summary": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Ashley Moody, the state's attorney general, will replace Marco Rubio in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday that Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will replace Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, in the Senate.",
      "\"Today I am proud to announce that I am selecting our attorney general, Ashley Moody, to serve as our next U.S. senator,\" DeSantis said at a news conference in Orlando, saying she's \"honorably served our people\" during her time as the state's top law enforcement officer.",
      "\"These are always significant appointments, but I think right now appointments like these are more significant than ever,\" DeSantis said. \"This is a time for action and a time for Washington, D.C., to deliver results for the American people.\"",
      "DeSantis called Trump's victory in the 2024 election \"remarkable,\" saying he earned a \"mandate for change.\"",
      "\"No more business as usual in Washington, D.C.,\" DeSantis added.",
      "The Florida governor emphasized border security as part of that mandate, saying Florida would be working with the Trump administration to make sure immigration laws are enforced.",
      "DeSantis outlined his criteria for the Senate appointment Thursday, saying he wanted someone who would deliver on Trump's agenda, commit to cutting spending, understand that federal bureaucracy has \"run amok\" and understand \"the fight against illegal immigration.\"",
      "Moody, 49, has served as Florida's attorney general since 2019. DeSantis touted Moody's \"impressive resume\" as a commercial litigator and federal prosecutor, noting that she became Florida's youngest circuit court judge in 2007. The Florida governor said Moody has been someone who \"has acted time and time again to support the values that we all share,\" from addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis to illegal immigration and human trafficking.",
      "DeSantis also pointed to Moody's track record of supporting the president-elect, noting that she signed on to lawsuits to \"take on the weaponization of law enforcement that targeted then-candidate Donald Trump,\" took on special counsel Jack Smith and fought back against New York Attorney General Letitia James. He also noted that Moody led the state investigation into the second assassination attempt against Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Moody, speaking after DeSantis on Thursday, said she would \"bring the same persistence and passion and tenacity as a United States senator that I have brought as Florida's attorney general.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to show up and fight for this nation and fight for President Trump to deliver the America first agenda on day one,\" Moody said, while pledging to rein in \"out of control federal agencies\" and bring down spending.",
      "Senate vacancies in Florida are filled by an appointment by the governor, who selects a replacement to serve until the next statewide election. DeSantis' appointment means Moody will be expected to hold the seat until a special election can be held in 2026. The winner of the 2026 election would serve the remainder of Rubio's term, meaning that person would have to run for election again in 2028.",
      "The announcement comes after months of speculation about who could fill the seat. A number of possibilities have emerged for DeSantis to appoint, including Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who until recently was the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Last month, she said she was removing herself from consideration.",
      "DeSantis' chief of staff James Uthmeier and Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez had also been floated, as had former Florida House Speaker Jose Olivia. DeSantis said Thursday that he also thinks highly of Reps. Kat Cammack and Cory Mills, whom he said had also been in the mix, but he didn't want to jeopardize the narrow House Republican majority. He noted that Uthmeier would become Florida's new attorney general.",
      "Trump tapped Rubio, who has represented Florida in the Senate since 2011, for the Cabinet post in November. The 53-year-old China hawk has extensive foreign policy experience and is expected to have among the smoothest paths to confirmation in the Senate. He appeared at his confirmation hearing this week, and is expected to resign from the Senate when Trump is sworn in next week.",

    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the Oval Office, his election gains among men have become a key focus. These gains \u2014 particularly among young and Latino men \u2014 suggest dissatisfaction with the way Democrats have addressed economic and societal changes affecting men.",
      "During the 2024 presidential election, much of the attention was placed on the female vote, as Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned to be the first female president and many high-profile women backed her campaign.",
      "However, as it turned out, many men had significant motivations to vote.",
      "\"A lot of men were sick of being told they are terrible and there is nothing they can do, and that's I think the huge mistake that Democrats made,\" said Kat Timpf on the Fox News program \"Gutfeld!\"",
      "How Trump's campaign appealed to issues men face",
      "Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of \"Of Boys and Men,\" sees this frustration as part of some larger trends for men.",
      "\"They have come to believe that the progressive agenda on behalf of women has felt it necessary to somehow either dismiss or even denigrate men \u2014 and they're over it,\" Reeves said. He also pointed out a troubling trend among young men, citing a survey where two-thirds reported feeling like no one knows them very well, and 15% had no close friends.",
      "Reeves also discussed the deeper issues men face, including stagnant wages and disproportionate death rates from suicide and overdose.",
      "\"The unwillingness of anybody on the center-left to just have a straightforward conversation about men's mental health, about male employment, about male wages has created a gigantic vacuum in our culture and in our politics,\" Reeves added.",
      "Republicans, according to Reeves, have filled this void. Through male-dominated social media platforms sometimes referred to as \"The Manosphere,\" including \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, conservative figures have successfully reached men, especially through sports and popular culture.",
      "\"We've dealt with \u2013 especially in the last three-and-a-half years \u2014 a complete dismemberment of what it is to be a man,\" said Tyrus, a conservative commentator, in an interview with Trump \u2014 a sentiment with which Trump agreed.",
      "Trump's appeal to men contrasts sharply with the left's more progressive stance on gender. Conservative commentator Michael Knowles said, \"Trump appealed to men because he appealed to men. He actually campaigned to try to win their votes.\"",
      "Knowles feels the left's approach has gone too far in disregarding men's issues.",
      "Faiz Shakir, chief political advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged Republicans have done a better job in connecting with men, even as he pointed out the Biden administration's focus on factory jobs and infrastructure has been beneficial to men. He suspects Trump will eventually take credit for these achievements.",
      "The growing divide between the left and right over how men are perceived in society remains a critical issue heading into the next election.",
      "Reeves warns against relying on the conventional wisdom, saying that \"if there's a problem, there has to be a villain.\" He says we can't blame either feminism or the women's movement for the challenges men face.",
      "\"This is definitely not the fault of women ... But the problem sometimes on the other side, on progressive left side, has been to say that, by definition, men can't have problems because men are the problem.\"",

It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public.

    "story": [
      "The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would\u00a0require more ships to slow down\u00a0in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",
      "Thousands of public comments",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",
      "\"They're kind of becoming more unpredictable with what they're doing in response to how the ocean conditions are changing,\" she said.",
      "Why these whales are important",
      "Whales are at the top of the ocean's food chain and they help capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the international nonprofit World Wildlife Fund.",
      "The right whale is among six out of the 13 great whale species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable.",
      "They numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \"a leading cause of the species' decline,\" the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of slower ship speed rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia\u00a0had head injuries\u00a0consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",

      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump.

      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",

But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:02:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications arising from surgery to treat prostate cancer.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon inspector general found in its review of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization last year that it \"increased unnecessarily\" the risks to national security, even if ultimately, there were no immediate consequences.",
      "\"Although we found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations arising from how the hospitalizations we reviewed were handled, the risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,\" Inspector General Robert Storch said in a statement.",
      "Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications related to surgery to treat prostate cancer. The Pentagon faced sharp criticism for waiting several days to inform the White House that Austin was in the hospital \u2014 and at one point, in the intensive care unit.",
      "The review did not identify any adverse impacts on operational command and control or Defense Department functions but says, \"we believe that there was a potential for adverse effects.\"",
      "A senior defense official told reporters shortly after the report was released, that the review \"found that at no time, was there a break in command and control\" and \"at every moment, either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense was fully prepared to support the president as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "The report states that during the course of his hospitalization, Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to his deputy secretary of defense from Jan. 2 to 5, but neither of them notified Congress or the White House Situation Room in a \"timely manner\" as required.",
      "The report found that Austin did not consider transferring authorities while he was undergoing medical procedures on Jan. 6 and 8 that required moderate sedation. The inspector general found no evidence that Austin told the deputy secretary or his chief of staff he was undergoing the procedures. According to the review, Austin had texted his chief of staff that he did not want his medical condition to become \"a media circus.\"",
      "Austin told the inspector general investigators he told his doctors he would have to notify his superiors if he underwent general anesthesia. He signed forms acknowledging moderate sedation but said he needed to remain functional as \"that was the mandate \u2026 and I'm confident that that happened.\" He said that his doctors met his \"requirement to remain \u2026 functional.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the inspector general in its 20 recommendations said the Defense Department should further define what is \"medically incapacitated,\" and the phrase, \"unable to perform the functions and duties.\" Other recommendations include expanding the scope of who is required to report the hospitalization of secretaries of defense or senior Pentagon officials.",
      "The inspector general announced last year it would initiate a review to: \"examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization in December 2023 \u2013 January 2024, and assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.\"",
      "The review found that Austin's intense privacy affected the course of events. It says that not only did Austin not tell his senior staff members of his medical condition or appointments, \"he specifically told one junior staff member 'if anyone had any questions they're more than welcome to ask [me] directly.'\"",
      "After he returned to work at the Pentagon following his hospitalization, Austin apologized for not telling President Biden or the public about when and why he had been hospitalized.",
      "\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"",
      "The senior defense official said Austin \"apologized and he committed to improving transparency and processes moving forward, which the department has already done over the past year to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "CBS News obtained the audio of the 911 call that led to the hospitalization in which an aide asked the operator if the ambulance headed to Austin's residence could be discreet.",
      "\"Can I ask that, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? We're trying to remain a little subtle,\" the caller is heard saying.",
      "A separate review by the Pentagon released last year concluded that there was no deliberate ill intent by Austin or his aides to keep the hospitalization secret but did acknowledge the policies for transferring the responsibilities of the secretary need to be improved.",
      "Austin told David Martin during a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview that he is now cancer-free.",
      "\"I thank God for that,\" Austin said.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:59:05 -0500",
    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship mega rocket on its seventh test flight Thursday, successfully \"catching\" the first stage booster back at its firing stand but losing its new-generation Starship upper stage spacecraft, which apparently broke up as it was reaching space. Falling debris from the destroyed Starship briefly delayed airline traffic out of Miami, Florida, federal officials said.",
      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",
      "Video posted to social media and verified by CBS News showed debris from the Starship falling in the area of Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.",
      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "In a news release, SpaceX said that \"initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas.\"",
      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",

    "summary": "Blue Origin expects the New Glenn to provide a viable alternative to SpaceX's market-dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Monday's planned launch was postponed due to technical issues. Read more here.",
      "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin readied the company's powerful New Glenn rocket for its delayed but long-awaited maiden flight early Monday, kicking off a high-stakes bid to compete head-to-head with Elon Musk's SpaceX and its industry dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
      "While more than one successful test flight will be needed to demonstrate the reliability needed for launches of costly NASA probes, high-priority national security payloads and other commercial spacecraft, the New Glenn, nearly 10 years after Bezos announced the project, is expected to be a viable alternative.",
      "Mounted atop pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the 321-foot-tall rocket is scheduled for blast off at 1 a.m. EST Monday, the opening of a three-hour window. Blue Origin had hoped to launch the rocket Friday, then Sunday, but both opportunities were ruled out due to rough seas in the booster landing zone.",
      "Mission managers expect better weather Monday.",
      "Like SpaceX's Falcon rockets, the first stage of the New Glenn, powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines generating a combined 3.8 million pounds of thrust, was designed to be reusable.",
      "After boosting the rocket's upper stage out of the lower atmosphere three minutes and 10 seconds after launch, the 188-foot-tall first stage will separate and attempt to land on a 380-foot-long custom-built ship named after Bezos' mother, Jacklyn, that will be stationed downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "From launch to touchdown: nine minutes and 28 seconds. While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin is making the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. Appropriately enough, the company named the booster \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "While the 23-foot-wide first stage is powered by liquified natural gas, the 88-foot-tall upper stage is equipped with two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines that generate a combined 320,000 pounds of thrust. They can be restarted in space up to three times over 16 hours, enabling the stage to place payloads in especially demanding orbits.",
      "The New Glenn's carbon-composite nose fairing, which encapsulates payloads during the climb to space, provides 16,184 cubic feet of volume, large enough to house an entire New Shepard rocket, the booster Blue Origin uses to launch space tourists\u00a0on sub-orbital flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "For its maiden flight, the New Glenn will carry a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as Blue Ring, a sort of space tug that can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing onboard computer support and even servicing.",
      "The flight plan calls for the upper stage and the attached Blue Ring test vehicle to reach an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles. The mission is expected to last five hours and 50 minutes from start to finish.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet, with 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other payloads weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck. There are no such payloads on the initial \"pathfinder\" flight, but the spacecraft will be thoroughly checked out in orbit.",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and now dominates the global commercial launch market, firing off 134 Falcon-family rockets last year and five so far in 2025. SpaceX has successfully recovered first stage boosters 395 times.",
      "SpaceX also is building a gargantuan new rocket -- the Super Heavy-Starship -- with a seventh test flight on tap as early as Monday from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, launch site. A variant of the rocket's Starship upper stage is being built for NASA to carry astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface as part of the Artemis program.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019 with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "Amazon plans its own fleet of more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper. The company says it has booked up to 95 launches with Blue Origin, the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"Once deployed, the Kuiper System will serve individual households, as well as schools, hospitals, businesses, disaster relief efforts, government agencies and other organizations operating in places without reliable broadband,\" Amazon says on its website.",
      "Whether Amazon can succeed against SpaceX in the space-based internet services market remains to be seen. But Blue Origin's New Glenn will provide an alternative to SpaceX when it comes to launch services.",
      "The rocket was designed from the ground up to be \"human rated,\" enabling astronaut flights at some point in the future. If successful, the rocket will eventually be used to launch NASA space probes, classified military payloads, commercial satellites, lunar cargo ships and even piloted moon landers for NASA.",
      "\"The New Glenn rocket is all about significantly reducing the cost of access to space,\" said Syracuse University professor and former NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. \"This will give SpaceX some serious competition. ... These are exciting times in the space business.\"",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB.

      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "title": "Does the tech industry really need so many workers on H-1B visas?",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

      "\"As we face the evolving threats of the 21st century, the mission and the success of DHS is more critical than ever. We must be vigilant and proactive and innovative to protect the homeland,\" she said in her opening statement. \"The challenges in front of us are extremely significant, and we must secure our borders against illegal trafficking and immigration.\"",
      "Noem, a former Republican member of Congress who has been South Dakota's governor since 2019, was expected to be asked about the incoming Trump administration's sweeping immigration plans, which include a promised mass deportation operation.",
      "DHS oversees airport security, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other responsibilities. The queston of FEMA funding came up early in the hearing when Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut raised the California wildfires. He expressed dismay about Trump's comments about the fires \u2014 and the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. He noted the president-elect said recently, \"We won't give him, referring to Gov. Newsom, money to put out fires, and if we don't give him money, he's got a problem,\" and asked Noem if she would say \"no\" to Trump if he tried to withhold aid to California or any other state for political reasons.",

Republicans control a majority in the Senate, making her confirmation likely.",
      "During the hearing, GOP senators asked Noem about an app introduced by the Biden administration, called CBP One, to allow migrants to set up an appointment at international bridges, where U.S. officials determine whether they should be allowed into the country to request asylum. It's been used millions of times to help process claims more quickly. Many Republicans oppose its use and asked about Noem's plans for the app.",
      "\"Will you use your authority to stop facilitating faster processing of illegal aliens into our country with the CBP One app,\" GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma asked.",
      "\"Yes, Senator,\" Noem responded. \"We will eliminate the CBP One app \u2014 maintain some of the data that's in it that's critical to knowing who's in our country \u2014 but that app will no longer be in use.\"",
      "Among other promises, Trump and his advisers have vowed to reverse Biden administration immigration programs, enact harsher rules at the U.S.-Mexico border, scale back refugee admissions and dramatically ramp deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally. The president-elect has also pledged to upend the longstanding principle of birthright citizenship, in a bid to prevent children born to unauthorized immigrants from becoming American citizens at birth.",
      "Considered a Trump loyalist, Noem has been praised by conservatives for her record as governor, which includes vocally opposing mask mandates and other COVID-era measures. But she's also garnered detractors. Tribal nations in South Dakota, for example, have banned her from their lands over comments she's made alleging cartel activity in tribal territory.",

      "\"We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights,\" the court said in a unanimous unsigned opinion, which upholds the lower court decision against TikTok. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote separately, with Gorsuch agreeing with the outcome of the case but splitting with the court's reasoning.",
      "The court's opinion comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had urged the court to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office.",

Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",

      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",

    "summary": "Melissa Calusinski has been behind bars in Illinois for 16 years in a case plagued by allegations of evidence manipulation, coerced confession and flawed medical opinions.",
    "story": [
      "Former day care worker Melissa Calusinski has served 16 years of a 31-year prison sentence for a crime she insists she didn't commit \u2014 a murder that may not have even happened.",
      "She was convicted in 2011, at the age of 25, of murdering Benjamin Kingan, a 16-month-old whom she cared for at an Illinois day care center. Over the years, her appeals have failed, but as \"48 Hours\" reports in a broadcast airing\u00a0 Saturday, Jan. 18 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount +, she has now taken her fight out of the court system and straight to the Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.",
      "This is a case \"48 Hours'\" correspondent Erin Moriarty has been reporting on for more than a decade, and Moriarty's latest report, \"Unraveling the Case Against Melissa,\" features new interviews and never-before-reported information.",
      "The story began on Jan. 14, 2009, when Calusinski, then 22, was working as a teacher's assistant at the Minee Subee day care in Lincolnshire, a suburb of Chicago. Late that afternoon, Calusinski was alone in a classroom with Ben and other children when she says she noticed he was unresponsive and foaming from the mouth. 911 was called. Ben was taken to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead an hour later.",
      "During an autopsy, the pathologist, Dr. Eupil Choi, told a detective that he observed a skull fracture, extensive bleeding inside Ben's head, and that the injury was caused by another person, using strong force, hours prior to Ben's death. And yet, according to the autopsy report, Ben had no cuts or serious wounds on the outside of his body. When police brought Calusinski in for questioning, she denied more than 60 times doing anything to Ben. But after nine long hours, under pressure and without an attorney, she confessed to throwing the toddler on the ground.",
      "\"The only way for me to get out was to make a confession, a false confession,\" Calusinski told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The trial and aftermath",
      "During her November 2011 trial, Lake County, Illinois, prosecutors argued that Ben was a perfectly healthy child leading up to his death. Choi testified about the skull fracture he said he observed \u2014 and how he believed the injury was recent and consistent with having been thrown to the floor by someone. Dr. Manny Montez, another pathologist who was brought in by the state to consult on the autopsy, testified that he examined the child's body and felt the skull fracture with his bare hands.",
      "Calusinski's trial attorney, Paul De Luca, tells Moriarty he had little to counter the alleged skull fracture because, before trial, prosecutors gave him a disc containing dark, unreadable X-rays. Still, De Luca argued that Calusinski was not guilty and that her confession was coerced. He and defense experts pointed to a previous injury Ben sustained. It was noticed at the day care three months before Ben's death and before Calusinski even started working there.",
      "Ben was also reported to have a habit of throwing himself back and hitting his head. The defense argued that habit exacerbated the old injury and contributed to his death. The jury ultimately rejected that argument, but Calusinski remained determined to prove her innocence, and in 2012, a year after her conviction, Dr. Thomas Rudd, the then-newly elected Lake County coroner, agreed to review the autopsy evidence at the urging of De Luca.",
      "In slides of the child's brain, Rudd identified what he said was evidence of the old injury \u2014 evidence that Choi, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy, had missed. Like the defense experts at trial, Rudd and another well-regarded pathologist he consulted with, believed that the old injury was further exacerbated by Ben's head banging. A day care worker, Nancy Kallinger, had told police she saw Ben throw himself back twice on the day he died.",
      "\"The added fluid of the recent injury\u2026pushes that brain down and shuts down the breathing system. That is the cause of the child's death. It was the old injury. The old injury was massive,\" Rudd told \"48 Hours\" in 2014.",
      "Still, prosecutors stood by their case. And even though Choi admitted in a sworn affidavit that he had missed that Ben had suffered an old injury, he said he would not have changed his testimony at trial.",
      "Then, in 2015, Rudd's staff found clear X-rays of Ben on the coroner's office computer that would turn the case upside down. Rudd and other defense experts said the clear X-rays showed Ben did not sustain a skull fracture. Rudd ultimately changed the manner of death on Ben's death certificate from homicide to undetermined.",
      "By this point, defense attorney Kathleen Zellner, who has built a career on getting the wrongfully convicted out of prison, had taken on Calusinski's case. Zellner fought to get Calusinski's case back before a judge and in 2016, Calusinski was granted an evidentiary hearing to present what Zellner argued was new evidence before Judge Daniel Shanes, the same Lake County judge who presided over Calusinski's trial. Zellner argued at that hearing that had the defense had access to the clear X-rays at the time of the trial, the verdict would have been different.",
      "\"The skull fracture became really important at trial because the prosecutors mentioned it 32 times,\" Zellner told Moriarty. \"It was the pivotal point in the state's case to convince the jury it was a homicide.\"",
      "But at the evidentiary hearing, prosecutors argued that there was no new evidence in the case and that the disc provided to the defense before trial had software to enhance the x-rays and that De Luca didn't do enough to brighten them. But De Luca testified he couldn't open the software, and Zellner, with the help of an imaging expert, argued that it didn't matter what De Luca did, that the X-rays he had been given had been modified and were inferior to the ones found on the coroner's office computer.",
      "At the evidentiary hearing, Zellner also called Paul Forman, the deputy coroner during Ben's autopsies, to the stand. Forman disputed the testimony of pathologist Montez, who testified during Calusinski's trial that he felt a fracture in Ben's skull. But Forman, who said he was there when Montez came to the coroner's office, testified that Montez never physically examined Ben's body or touched the child's skull.",
      "Dr. Robert Zimmerman, a renowned pediatric neuroradiologist, also took the stand for the defense at the evidentiary hearing, and he too raised questions about Montez's testimony. Zimmerman testified that if the skull fracture had existed, it would be visible on the clear X-rays. According to him, it wasn't.",
      "Still, prosecutors stood by their trial witnesses, Montez and Choi, who said they saw and felt a skull fracture. Neither doctor responded to \"48 Hours\"' recent requests for comment. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, Judge Shanes ruled against Calusinski and denied her a new trial. In his ruling, Shanes stated that he didn't find Forman's testimony regarding Montez credible, and he agreed with the state that De Luca could have brightened the X-rays and made them readable. An appeals court affirmed that decision.",
      "\"I just don't understand,\" Calusinski told Moriarty through tears.",
      "Then, in 2022, there was a development that gave Calusinski and her defense hope. Eric Rinehart, a new state's attorney in Lake County, had taken office. Zellner says Rinehart sought more information on the discrepancy over the X-rays, so he recommended she retain the digital forensics company, Garrett Discovery.",
      "In this week's \"48 Hours,\" Andrew Garrett and Brian Bowman, of Garrett Discovery, walk Moriarty through their findings. In a report, they concluded the X-rays were manipulated by someone using a software tool used to view X-rays and \"that resulted in black washed out images which were unreadable.\"",
      "\"I can't think of an innocent explanation,\" Garrett told Moriarty.",
      "Garrett and Bowman presented their findings to Rinehart in a November 2022 meeting attended by Zellner and De Luca.",
      "\"Eric was just indignant,\" Zellner told \"48 Hours.\" \"He was saying, whoever had done this manipulation should be held accountable.\"",
      "\"I thought he was gonna do something about it,\" De Luca said.",
      "But according to Zellner and De Luca, nothing happened after that meeting. By April 2024, Zellner decided to file a clemency petition asking that Pritzker exonerate Calusinski   or release her for time served.",
      "\"I believe this is her best chance for freedom,\" Zellner told Moriarty.",
      "Melissa Calusinski's fight for clemency",
      "A hearing was scheduled for July 2024 before the governor's prisoner review board. But days before that hearing, in a twist that Zellner says she didn't see coming, Rinehart met with an attorney for Ben's family and then wrote a letter to the board stating his office \"strongly opposes Melissa's clemency petition.\"",
      "Rinehart would not do an on-camera interview with \"48 Hours\" or speak on the record, but in that letter to the board, he wrote that there is no new evidence in the case \u2014 and that Calusinski's   petition for clemency does not establish innocence.",
      "On July 9, 2024, Zellner went before the prisoner review board to make her case for Calusinski's freedom. She was joined by De Luca, computer forensics experts Andrew Garrett and Brian Bowman, and Kathryn Thomas, a Yale psychologist who evaluated Calusinski and found her to be particularly susceptible to giving a false confession.",
      "Thomas told the board that she and her colleague, psychiatrist Alexander Westphal, diagnosed Calusinski with borderline intellectual functioning. Calusinski scored at a 4.8 grade level in sentence comprehension. They also diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from a rape she reported about two-and-a-half years before Ben's death. But not everyone at the clemency hearing was there in support of Calusinski's release. Two Lake County assistant state's attorneys, one of whom had prosecuted Calusinski, spoke in opposition, as well as Ben Kingan's parents, who said they were convinced Calusinski is guilty.",
      "Following the hearing, it was up to the prisoner review board to make a confidential recommendation to Pritzker as to whether Calusinski   should be released, and \"48 Hours\" has learned that recommendation was just made. There is no deadline for the governor to act.",
      "When Moriarty asked Calusinski what she would say to the governor if given the chance, she responded, \"I would say, 'Just please, look at my case\u2026I didn't do this.'\"",
      "Moriarty's report includes new interviews she conducted with Calusinski, her family, her attorneys, the computer forensics experts, and a false confession expert who analyzed the case. Moriarty also interviewed two former employees of the day care who have never spoken out before.",

    "story": [
      "Block, the parent company of popular online payment service Cash App, has been ordered by a federal agency to pay as much as $175 million because of repeated failures by the financial services provider to protect customers from fraud.",
      "Block has agreed to pay up to $120 million to consumers harmed by fraudulent transactions and unfair business practices detailed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a consent order filed on Thursday. The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",
      "\"Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.\"",
      "Block disputes the CFPB's findings.",
      "\"While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what's best for our customers and our business,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",
      "Block made $7.5 billion in gross profit in 2023, roughly $4 billion of which came from Cash App, according to the CFPB.",

    "title": "As Biden exits, how will he be remembered for his handling of the U.S. economy?",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 05:00:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a relatively strong economy when he's inaugurated. Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "Telemetry from the Starship froze just more than 8 minutes after launch from Texas, moments after engines began shutting down.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship mega rocket on its seventh test flight Thursday, successfully \"catching\" the first stage booster back at its firing stand but losing its new-generation Starship upper stage spacecraft, which apparently broke up as it was reaching space. Falling debris from the destroyed Starship briefly delayed airline traffic out of Miami, Florida, federal officials said.",
      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",
      "Video posted to social media and verified by CBS News showed debris from the Starship falling in the area of Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.",
      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "In a news release, SpaceX said that \"initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas.\"",
      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in the 2027 timeframe.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched in an Orion capsule atop NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in orbit around the moon for the descent to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

In a home built using the passive design concept, there are very few places for embers to get caught, according to Johny Rezvani, a Passive Home material supplier.",
      "Compared to the roof vents on most houses, a Passive House has just a single air intake. A powerful filtration system is installed to control the flow of air, which helps keep embers out.",

      "The truck had been packed with 67 people, and the dead included 27 from Mexico, 14 from Honduras, seven from Guatemala and two from El Salvador, according to Mexican authorities. Prosecutors have said migrants paid up to $15,000 each to be taken across the U.S. border.",
      "The incident happened on a remote San Antonio back road on June 27, 2022. Police officers detained Zamorano after spotting him hiding in nearby brush, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. A search of Zamorano's cellphone showed calls concerning the smuggling run.",
      "Surveillance video of the 18-wheeler passing through a Border Patrol checkpoint showed the driver matched Zamorano's description, according to the indictment.",
      "Also charged previously in the tragedy was Christian Martinez, also of Texas, who with Zamorano was arrested shortly after the migrants were found. Martinez has since pleaded guilty to smuggling-related charges.",
      "Four Mexican nationals were also arrested in the case in 2023. And in August, a suspect arrested in Guatemala was charged with helping coordinate the smuggling attempt. U.S. authorities said they would seek the extradition of Rigoberto Rom\u00e1n Miranda Orozco, who is charged with six counts of migrant smuggling resulting in death or serious injury. Authorities alleged he is connected to four Guatemalan migrants in the trailer, three of whom died, and faces up to life in prison if convicted.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:09:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Watch Duty app's fire fact-checkers brought reliable information to Los Angeles residents during a week of chaos.",
    "story": [
      "Since the Palisades Fire broke out on the morning of Jan. 7, several more wildfires have ravaged the Los Angeles area. At least 27 people have died and more than 12,000 structures have been destroyed.",
      "In the middle of all of this, a false evacuation alert sent to all of L.A. County's approximately 10 million residents on Jan. 9 added to the chaos, as many Angelenos were left unsure what to believe.",
      "\"While the city alerts are definitely alarming, we just aren't able to take any city push alerts at face value after [a] couple rounds of mistakes,\" Sharvari Akre-Bhide, a clinical researcher living in L.A., told CBS News.",
      "Instead, L.A. residents flocked to Watch Duty, an app which shows real-time updates and alerts for wildfires in 21 states.",
      "In the first days of the fires, Watch Duty shot to the No. 1 spot in Apple's app store seemingly overnight. It provides users easy-to-read maps showing burn areas, evacuation zones, fire cameras and more. It's all sourced from publicly available data and verified by a team of fire fact-checkers.",
      "\"Sending errant emergency alerts is a quick way to erode trust,\" John Mills, co-founder and CEO of the app told CBS News.",
      "Watch Duty has been a lifeline for many people in wildfire-prone communities since it was created in 2021.",
      "\"We did heed the first city alert enough to pack an emergency bag, but other than that have been monitoring Watch Duty before taking any action,\" Akre-Bhide said. \"...We've been basically cross checking every city push alert that goes out immediately with Watch Duty and then reevaluating.\"",
      "She's not the only one. Longtime California resident Keri Gailloux told CBS News she checks Watch Duty the same way she would her favorite weather app.",
      "\"It's about the facts,\" Gailloux said. \"It's about what's real and in real time, as much as you can get it. And while I love listening to people's opinions about things, that's where misinformation really can happen.\"",
      "The process to track and verify its information is deceptively simple, Watch Duty says. Information comes in, gets confirmed and goes out to users.",
      "\"The difference with Watch Duty is that the people who are reporting on it are people who have been in the field, people who understand the importance of, 'You've got a five minute evacuation window,'\" Gailloux said.",
      "Watch Duty has more than 150 volunteers made up of active and retired first responders, firefighters and dispatchers who monitor radios, scan the internet, and reach out to officials. If something comes in through one of those channels, the team coordinates and confirms the various pieces of new information. Once it's confirmed, an incident leader will send the update to the app, which in turn alerts users in the area.",
      "\"We have historical recordings of everything that we do here.\" Mills explained. \"So it's kind of hard to debate, because that's what was said at that time. And so we try to remove opinion and sensationalism from this.\"",
      "Mills says that straightforward process of fact and science \"used to be the world that we lived in, and we want to bring that back.\"",
      "\"We didn't start this because of misinformation,\" Mills said. \"We started it from looking at good information.\"",
      "Mills points to what he believes is an outdated national alert system, ill-equipped to handle the ferocity of future natural disasters as one of the reasons for the confusion seen in California.",
      "\"They have these arcane checks and balances from the FEMA ICS (Incident Command System) structure that was invented in the seventies.\" Mills said. \"Disasters are moving faster, and they haven't updated.\"",
      "Mills remarks come as the L.A. Fire Department is facing scrutiny over its response to the Palisades Fire.",
      "\"I'm not here blaming L.A. Emergency Operations Center or any of these people. This is a hard job to do,\" Mills said.",
      "Gailloux seems to agree.",
      "\"If you're waiting for the news to tell you what to do, or you're waiting for the fire trucks to show up, you could be dead.\" Gailloux said. \"[Watch Duty] understands the urgency.\"",
      "Mills sees a need for Watch Duty's service beyond fires, with climate change putting more people in the path of potential disasters.",
      "\"We've seen the same nonsense happen during floods, the recent tsunami warning in California that went awry, and just the misinformation that spreads around panic.\"",
      "According to Mills, Watch Duty is unique from its Silicon Valley counterparts in that it is a nonprofit with no plans to change.",
      "\"Watch Duty is a nonprofit because, I mean the very easy answer is, it's the right thing to do,\" Mills said.",
      "With 2.8 million users, premium membership options and full-time employees, Watch Duty has a significant cash flow. According to the company's 2024 annual report, it brought in $5.6 million in funding through a combination of grants, donations, and paying members. But Mills has no plans to put the app behind a paywall.",
      "\"This is a governmental service and a municipal operation that needs to exist free and devoid of ads, spam, sign-up logins, marketing to 3rd parties, [and] selling you fire hoses when you're trying to run for your life.\" Mills said. \"It's just ridiculous, and so we will take no part in that.\"",
      "So how should California government officials respond? Says Mills, \"If I were them, I would pick up the phone and call me.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas is allowing three other states to pursue a challenge seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in Texas ruled Thursday that three other states can move ahead with their effort to roll back federal rules and make it harder for people across the U.S. to access the abortion drug mifepristone.",
      "The states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri made the request in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. The only judge based there is Matthew Kacsmaryk, a nominee of former President Donald Trump who previously ruled in favor of a challenge to the pill's approval.",
      "The states want the federal Food and Drug Administration to prohibit telehealth prescriptions for mifepristone and require that it be used only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the current limit of 10 weeks. They also want to require three in-person doctor office visits instead of none to get the drug.",
      "That's because, the states argue, efforts to provide access to the pills \"undermine state abortion laws and frustrate state law enforcement,\" according to court documents.",
      "Meanwhile, Kacsmaryk said they shouldn't be automatically discounted from suing in Texas just because they're outside the state.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that the case should have been settled when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to mifepristone last year, where the justices issued a narrow ruling finding that abortion opponents who first filed the case lacked the legal right to sue.",
      "Kacsmaryk's decision \"has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom,\" the ACLU said.",
      "The ruling comes days before Trump begins his second term as president, so his administration will likely be representing the FDA in the case. Trump has repeatedly said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government, though he's also stressed on the campaign trail that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion in 2022.",
      "In the years since, abortion opponents have increasingly targeted abortion pills, largely due to most U.S. abortions being carried out using drugs rather than through surgical procedures. So far, at least four states \u2014 Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have seen Republicans introduce bills aimed at banning pills. None take the same approach as Louisiana, which last year classified the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "Previously, Kacsmaryk sided with a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations that wanted the FDA to be forced to rescind entirely its approval of mifepristone in 2000.",
      "Yet the states are pursuing a narrower challenge. Rather than target the approval entirely, they sought to undo a series of FDA updates that have eased access.",
      "But while the states' leaders are pushing to severely limit access to the drugs, voters in Missouri sent a different message in November when they approved a ballot measure to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. In Idaho, abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy. In Kansas, abortion is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.",
      "Across the U.S., 13 states under Republican legislative control bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more ban it after the first six weeks \u2014 before women often know they're pregnant.",
      "Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws seeking to shield from investigations and prosecutions the doctors who prescribe the pills via telehealth appointments and mail them to patients in states with bans. Those prescriptions are a major reason a study found that residents of states with bans are getting abortions in about the same numbers as they were before the bans were in place.",
      "Mifepristone is usually used in combination with a second drug for medication abortion, which has accounted for more than three-fifths of all abortions in the U.S. since the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",

    "summary": "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.",
    "story": [
      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to install Texas' border czar as head of U.S. Border Patrol, replacing the career official who currently leads the agency in charge of stopping the illicit movement of migrants and drugs.",
      "Mike Banks, who has spearheaded Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border crackdown, is expected to be appointed Border Patrol chief after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, two sources familiar with the move told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Banks would replace current Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, a 28-year veteran career official at the agency. Owens is set to retire from government service in April, two U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "In an internal message sent to agents Thursday and obtained by CBS News, Owens said the opportunity to serve as Border Patrol chief was \"the highest honor I have ever received.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, I will leave with a profound sense of optimism about its future and that of our country,\" Owens wrote. \"I will take comfort knowing that you are on our frontline, standing between the innocent and the evil.\"",
      "Banks' appointment would be a departure from the general practice of Border Patrol having leaders that are career government officials, not political appointees.",
      "A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, Banks has been a key player in Texas' aggressive effort to counter what the state has argued is the Biden administration's failure to secure the southern border amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "Since March 2021, Texas has bussed tens of thousands of migrants to major Democratic-led U.S. cities, deployed the National Guard to fortify the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and assigned troopers to arrest migrants on criminal trespassing charges.",
      "It also tried to enact its own immigration law to arrest and jail migrants suspected of entering the country illegally, though that measure is currently held up in court.",
      "As Border Patrol chief, Banks would oversee the agents in green uniforms responsible for apprehending migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally between official entry points, or those who reach Florida and other coastal sectors by sea. Over the past years, discontent among rank-and-file agents has grown over disagreements with the Biden administration's immigration policies.",
      "One U.S. official said Banks is expected to join the second Trump administration in some capacity soon after Trump is inaugurated, alongside Rodney Scott, who the president-elect has tapped to be his CBP commissioner.",
      "Scott was a Border Patrol chief himself, appointed under the first Trump administration, until he was ousted by the Biden administration in the spring of 2021. As CBP commissioner, Scott would oversee Border Patrol, but also customs and immigration officials at airports, sea ports and land crossings. That position requires Senate confirmation.",
      "Beyond Banks and Scott, the incoming Trump administration also plans to install Tom Homan, a longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, as its border czar, a new White House position. Homan is expected to play a key role in carrying out what Trump has promised will be the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "During the first three years of the Biden administration, CBP reported record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, and officials struggled at times to contain mass illegal crossings. But unlawful border crossings have since plunged to a four-year low due to asylum limits President Biden enacted in June, and Mexico's efforts to stop migrants from trekking north.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Thursday that it may announce opinions on Friday morning, a last-minute addition to the schedule that comes just two days before a law that would ban TikTok is set to go into effect.",
      "\"The Court may announce opinions on the homepage beginning at 10 a.m.,\" a notice on the\u00a0court's website said, without specifying what case or cases might be decided. \"The Court will not take the Bench.\"",
      "The law would cut TikTok off from U.S. app stores and hosting services if it does not cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, before the Jan. 19 deadline.",
      "The Supreme Court seemed likely to upload the law when it heard arguments over TikTok's legal challenge last week, with the justices seeming sympathetic to the government's claims that China could use TikTok to collect a vast amount of data on its American users and spy on them.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the potential Supreme Court decision is \"enormously consequential\" for the platform's 170 million users in the U.S. and their free speech rights.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Sunday, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said last week. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "In April, Congress swiftly passed the bipartisan legislation, known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as part of a foreign aid package, and it was signed into law by President Biden. It gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, with the possibility of a 90-day extension if a sale were in progress by the January deadline. Absent a sale, TikTok loses access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S.",
      "The law would take effect one day before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Trump, who attempted to prohibit the app during his first term over national security concerns, has since said he wants to \"save\" the app and has credited it with helping him win over more youth voters.",
      "\"We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,\" Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday. \"It's been a great platform for him and his campaign.\"",
      "Some lawmakers are also pushing for a delay in the law's implementation. Two Democratic senators said Thursday they sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to trigger a provision in the measure to delay it for another 90 days, despite no apparent sale being in progress.",
      "\"It's time to take a breath, try to step back, buy some time, try to figure this out rationally. But in no way should we have TikTok go dark,\" Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said Thursday. \"It would be catastrophic with just so many small businesses, so many creators, so many communities that have been created with no alternative available.\"",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge\u00a0in May that called the law \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "A federal appeals court issued a ruling in December that upheld the law, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" A week later, the appeals court denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "On Dec. 16, TikTok asked the Supreme Court for a temporary pause, saying it would suffer \"immediate irreparable harm\" if the high court did not delay the ban. Two days later, the Supreme Court said it would take up the challenge to the law under an expedited timeline.",

      "While the U.S. has developed and tested DEWs for military applications \u2014 such as disabling enemy drones or missiles \u2014 there is no credible evidence of DEWs being employed in civilian settings, including for igniting wildfires.",
      "The DEW theory also surfaced during the California wildfires of 2018, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claiming in a now-deleted social media post the fires could be caused by lasers from space. And online users spread the conspiracy during other disasters including the Canadian and Maui fires in 2023 and the Texas Smokehouse Creek wildfire in 2024.",

And the Los Angeles Area's SmartLA 2028 initiative suggests renovating the city's transportation systems, among other technological changes, to make the city greener \u2014 but the plan does not involve mass demolition or rebuilding.",
      "This conspiracy also gained traction after the wildfires in Maui, when a video of Hawaii's governor was clipped, taken out of context and shared to bolster the false claim the state was aiming to create a \"smart city\" on scorched land. And similar theories were debunked after wildfires in Canada and Spain's Canary Islands.",

      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",

Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced early Friday local time that Israel has finalized its ceasefire agreement with the militant group Hamas that will see the release of hostages held in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the prime minister \"has been updated by the negotiating team that agreements have been reached on a deal for the release of the hostages.\"",
      "Netanyahu's security cabinet was meeting Friday to consider the deal. The exact details of the updated negotiations were not immediately provided.",
      "This comes after the\u00a0two sides previously announced Wednesday\u00a0that they had reached a ceasefire agreement, news which brought jubilation to thousands of people across the decimated Palestinian territory and in Israel.",
      "However, that joy was constrained by anxiety on Thursday, with those jitters fueled by both increasing bloodshed in Gaza and doubt cast by Israel's leader on the solidity of the deal announced the previous evening.",
      "Netanyahu said Thursday that a \"last-minute crisis\" with Hamas was delaying Israel's final approval of the long-sought truce. Israeli media reports suggested the delay was likely down to Netanyahu trying to buy time to deal with nationalist hardliners in his cabinet who've always fiercely opposed any agreement with Hamas.",
      "\"We fully expect the deal to proceed as described yesterday, and on the timeline that we've laid out, so implementation beginning as soon as Sunday with a ceasefire and the release of the first hostages,\" U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer said Thursday on \"CBS Mornings,\" acknowledging \"a set of implementation details and conditions that are going to be a challenge throughout the implementation of this deal, which is going to extend well into the next administration.\"",
      "Finer said President Biden had spoken with Netanyahu \"twice in the last few days, including yesterday after the agreement was reached in Doha.\"",
      "The deal is a fragile one, and the logistics of it will be extremely complex \u2014 even Hamas getting the hostages safely to a handover point will present significant security challenges.",
      "The agreement is not set to take effect until Sunday, and with Israel's military increasing attacks in Gaza rather than easing them in the wake of the deal \u2014 and none of the roughly 100 hostages expected to come home for several days \u2014 nobody who spoke with CBS News on either side of the border seemed ready to take for granted the peace looming tantalizingly just over the horizon.",
      "In Gaza, \"a new chance to live\"",

      "Mahmood Kurdia, who's been living in the southern city of Khan Younis after being forced from his home in northern Gaza, said he couldn't wait to get back, even though he knows he has virtually nothing to go back to.",
      "\"I want to go back home to see my family, my neighbors and my home. Even though my home is just ruins now, but I still want to see it. I want to remove the rubble and put my tent on the top of the ruins and say to Israel that I'm back,\" he told CBS News on Wednesday.\"",
      "Like everyone else, however, he was keenly aware that peace, if it is coming, is still three days away.",

Both agencies told CBS News that the dead including 21 children and 24 women.",
      "Still, Kurdia couldn't help cling to hope.",
      "\"This news means a new chance to live,\" he said. \"This means a new chance for us to live and watch our children live, grow and get education. It is just a new hope for survival. This is the ceasefire deal we hope to get.\"",
      "Israeli hostage's cousin happy \u2014 but \"not breathing\"",
      "In Tel Aviv, a small crowd gathered Wednesday night on the spot where protesters have, week after week, demanded that Israel's government bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "Yifat Kalderon was among them. Her cousin Ofer was among the 251 people kidnapped during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that saw militants kill some 1,200 people, and which sparked the war that has raged for almost 480 days.",
      "Ofer was among the dozens of people kidnapped by the gunmen who stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz. Over the age of 50, he should be among the hostages released by Hamas in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire agreement.",
      "But asked if she felt a huge relief on Wednesday night, Kalderon made it clear that emotion would have to wait.",
      "\"No,\" she said. \"I'm going to feel a huge relief when it's going to be done. When are we going to get all the 90-98 hostages alive and the dead ones back home.\"",
      "With bombs still falling in Gaza and little to indicate any new level of trust between Israel and Hamas, hostages' families all across Israel were left to keep waiting, and worrying about everything that could still go wrong.",
      "\"I'm not saying that I'm not happy,\" Kalderon said. \"But I'm trying to, you know, take care of myself, not to be, you know, I don't want to - I want to see them, first of all. Until I'm going to see them crossing the border\u2026 I'm not going to believe anything.\"",

      "London - Britain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced Thursday that there would be a number of new central government-backed local inquiries into years-old allegations of child grooming gangs, weeks after Elon Musk accused British Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failings in relation to the handling of the crimes in a series of tweets. The crimes took place a decade ago when Starmer was the country's top prosecutor.",
      "Musk's tweets\u00a0targeted Starmer personally, suggesting he should be in jail and that \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,\" thrusting the crimes back into the political conversation in Britain.",
      "Starmer defended his record and denounced the criticism as politically motivated.",
      "\"Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible, they're not interested in victims. They're interested in themselves,\" Starmer told reporters after Musk's tweets earlier this month, not mentioning the tech mogul and close associate of Donald Trump by name.",
      "In 2012, a newspaper report on the grooming led to a major government inquiry, which two years later found that at least 1,400 children had been subjected to sexual exploitation in Rotherham, northern England, between 1997 and 2013. Similar exploitation was discovered in other towns, leading to a national inquiry.",
      "The prosecution service, which was led by Starmer between 2008 and 2013, was criticized in the report for not pursuing charges in Rochdale because it viewed a victim as \"unreliable\" following an investigation between 2008 and 2009. That decision was later overturned by a Starmer appointee.",
      "\"Mr. Starmer has striven to improve the treatment of victims of sexual assault within the criminal justice system throughout his term as Director of Public Prosecution,\" a 2013 report from the Home Affairs Committee said.",
      "In response to Musk's tweets and the political pressure they sparked, Starmer vigorously defended his record.",
      "\"I brought the first major prosecution of an Asian grooming gang in this particular case. \u2026 it was the first of its kind. We changed, or I changed, the whole prosecution approach, because I wanted to challenge, and did challenge, the myths and stereotypes that were stopping those victims being heard,\" Starmer said. \"When I left office, we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record.\"",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",

      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",

      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",

      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released.",
      "On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said.

      "At least 43 others were hospitalized \u2014 32 of them in intensive care \u2014 Turkish officials said. Since the start of the new year, they said a total of 34 people have died from the effects of bootleg alcohol. Alcohol tainted with methanol is thought to be the cause.",
      "Methanol is a substance that's often added to alcohol to increase its potency. It's often used in illegally produced products instead of ethanol because it's cheaper, according to a study which looked at illegally produced alcohol in southern Turkey, and it can cause blindness, liver damage and death.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Turkey's Ministry of Health.",
      "Poisonings from adulterated alcohol are quite common in Turkey, where private production has shot up as authorities crank up taxes on alcoholic drinks.",
      "In 2024, 110 people fell ill after drinking tainted alcohol in Istanbul, of whom 48 died, according to government officials.",
      "Turkey's anise-flavored national liquor, Raki, is most commonly counterfeited. The price has leapt to around 1,300 lira ($37.20) per liter in supermarkets. On Jan. 1, Turkey increased the country's minimum wage to 22,104 lira ($600).",
      "President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was elected in 2014 and previously served as prime minister of the country's ruling party, played a major role in amending Turkey's alcohol legislation. Since 2013, Turkey has forbidden advertisements promoting alcohol, prohibited alcoholic brands from sponsoring events, and banned scenes depicting alcohol use in media.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:28:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada decided to stick with the lawyer defending him from U.S. drug trafficking charges despite a possible conflict of interest.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that they're discussing a potential plea deal with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican drug lord who was arrested last summer and whose son could testify against him if he goes to trial.",
      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case - Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\"I don't want a different attorney,\" the father said through a court interpreter. \"I want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\"",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\"They wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\" he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son - \"for example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \"incomprehensible\" to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",
      "Mexico's foreign ministry reacted by expressing \"surprise\" in a formal note to the U.S. embassy about the envoy's statement.",

      "Through falsified documents and images as well as artificial intelligence, Anne believed she was speaking to, and eventually in a relationship with, the 61-year-old actor.",

      "\"At first I said to myself that it was fake, that it's ridiculous,\" Anne said, per AFP. \"But I'm not used to social media and I didn't really understand what was happening to me.\" Despite her skepticism, Anne proceeded with the conversation before being messaged by the alleged Pitt.",

The operation was multifaceted, with others posing as Pitt's manager and daughter, Shiloh, who he shares with ex-wife Angelina Jolie, to aid in the con. Following a contentious eight-year legal battle, Pitt and Jolie finalized their divorce settlement in 2024 after being legally declared \"single\" in 2019.",
      "\"What makes these scams particularly dangerous is their multilayered approach,\" Marva Bailer, AI expert and founder and CEO of Qualaix, told Fox News Digital. \"Scammers build trust over time, often pretending to be a family member, a staff member or even someone close to the celebrity who claims they are helping the celebrity by managing their charitable efforts. This indirect approach makes the scam seem more credible, as it\u2019s not the celebrity asking for help directly, it's someone positioned to be more relatable or \u2018realistic.\u2019 It plays on the idea that the celebrity is too proud or private to ask for help themselves, which makes the situation seem more genuine.\"",

      "A recent divorc\u00e9e, Anne relayed to the scammer that she'd received a hefty divorce settlement of 775,000 euros. After this admission, the Pitt impersonator told Anne that he had kidney cancer and was struggling to pay for his treatments due to his ongoing divorce proceedings with Jolie. Anne sent most of her divorce settlement to the fake Pitt.",
      "Throughout the treatment, the alleged Pitt sent Anne a series of doctored pictures depicting his time in the hospital receiving treatment. In one picture, Pitt lies in a hospital bed holding a card that reads, \"Anne I love you.\"",

After initially reading a report that Pitt was involved with businesswoman In\u00e9s de Ramon, she was sent a fake TV report to mitigate her qualms, which clarified the couple wasn't together.",
      "When photos of the couple were released over the summer, Anne knew it was all a con and decided to take legal action. The story was ultimately pulled by TF1 because she started to experience extreme ridicule. The network released a statement saying they'd chosen to pull the story from their platforms after the initial broadcast \"sparked a wave of harassment\" against the victim.",

      "Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, is introducing the \"Security First Act\" which would require the secretary of state to consider designating Mexican drug cartels and TdA as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs).",
      "An FTO designation allows for targeted action against members, including financial penalties. It is illegal for anyone to provide support or resources to an FTO, and financial institutions must report those funds to the Treasury.

      "Gonzales\u2019 bill would also increase funding to Operation Stonegarden, which is a federal grant to provide resources to states and local law enforcement for border security. It would also demand a report on technology needed at the border to stop terrorists entering the U.S., and another report on Customs and Border Protection hiring practices.",
      "The crisis at the southern border saw a sharp increase in the presence of TdA, a gang that is believed to have originated in Venezuelan prisons and moved north. Border officials told Fox last year that they see the gang as a top priority, as its presence has been felt in states like Texas, Colorado and New York.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in September that he was declaring TdA an FTO and establishing a database to verify if arrestees are TdA members. Now, Gonzales wants to see more action from the incoming administration on the bloodthirsty gang.",
      "\"It's time to call them what they are, they're terrorist organizations, and they terrorize our community,\" he said. \"I'm grateful President Trump is in there, and it's time for us to not only take the gloves off, but put some teeth in the legislation.

      "\"Those of us that live along the border, you know, we don't need a commission to to tell us that we're being terrorized, but some people do, but I feel very confident with this administration, with the way Trump has handled things and talked about it, is they would go along with that route,\" he said.",

This is an American issue,\" he said. \"And how do we get TDA out of all 50 states? You label them as a terrorist organization, and you turn law enforcement loose to go after and scoop them up.\"",
      "Gonzales has a record of bipartisanship over border security, often sponsoring bills that pick up Democratic support. He says that he is hopeful this bill will have a similar effect given a change in the temperature on immigration among some Democrats -- who have recently put their support behind bills like the Laken Riley Act.",

    "story": [
      "Historian Victor Davis Hanson talks causes and consequences of the recent LA wildfires, including poor leadership and the fire chief's focus on diversity.",
      "There were many things that preceded the \"nonsensical\" response from Los Angeles and California state leaders to the devastating wildfires that continue to blaze across the region, according to historian and political commentator Victor Davis Hanson.",
      "\"To mitigate you have to know what went wrong, and there were short-term and long-term problems,\" Davis, a Hoover Institution public policy think tank senior fellow, told Fox News Digital in a Tuesday interview. \"And I don't think climate change played a role, at least a non-immediate role.\"",
      "Davis described the situation as a \"woke green hydrogen bomb\" \u2014 from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' absence during the critical first 24 hours of the inferno to empty fire hydrants, a dysfunctional reservoir, a defunded fire department and a lack of new water infrastructure despite Gov. Gavin Newsom's support of the billions of dollars earmarked to address it.",
      "LA COUNCILWOMAN WHOSE DISTRICT RAVAGED BY WILDFIRES LOOKS TO HOLD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR EMPTY RESERVOIRS",
      "Historian Victor Davis Hanson shares his analysis of what went wrong and led up to the catastrophic wildfire management in Los Angeles. (Getty Images)",
      "\"It's a very fragile system,\" Hanson said. \"What Gavin Newsom did not do is he did not take the allotted money and build the reservoirs that would have accommodated the increased population. Number two, that water that is being pumped across the [Sacramento-San Joaquin River] Delta, he let go out into the bay under the demands of environmentalists. He said in his defense that the reservoirs are full. That's not true. If you look at the biggest one, it's only 75% full, and we are in a semi-drought right now.\"",
      "Newsom told NBC News in a pretaped interview that aired Sunday, \"The reservoirs are completely full \u2014 the state reservoirs here in Southern California. That mis- and disinformation, I don\u2019t think, advantages or aids any of us.\"",
      "But as of Tuesday, Shasta Lake, California's largest reservoir, was at 77% capacity, holding approximately 3.52 million acre-feet of water out of its total capacity of 4.55 million acre-feet, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "California's existing reservoirs can only hold so much water, and many were built in the mid-20th century.",
      "In 2014, Golden State voters passed Proposition 1, also known as the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act, which authorized $2.7 billion in bonds to increase the state's water storage capacity through building new reservoirs and groundwater storage facilities. Yet as of January, no new reservoirs have been completed under Prop. 1.",
      "In 2024, the state experienced record-breaking rainfall after an atmospheric river event, but the existing water infrastructure faced difficulties managing the sudden influx of water. A significant portion of that rainfall was dumped into the ocean as the state struggles to properly store water, multiple California agencies said.",
      "\"There was a roughly 120 million gallon reservoir that could have been used because they only had three million in reserve \u2014 that would have probably made the difference,\" Hanson said. \"That had been idle for almost a year, and it was because the cover was torn. It was just nonsensical.\"",
      "The out-of-order reservoir Hanson referred to, known as the Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades, has been closed for repairs since February due to a tear in its covering, which was designed to maintain the water quality, the Los Angeles Times first reported Tuesday.",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has been criticized for being on a trip to Africa when the wildfires broke out, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom has shifted blame and ordered an independent review of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. (AP/Getty)",
      "Hanson has a Central Valley farm that relies on snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, he explained.",
      "In California\u2019s Central Valley, farming water typically comes from the Sierra, mainly through the San Joaquin River system, which is supported by major dams like Shaver, Huntington and Pine Flat. That water is often released into the Sacramento River, which flows into the Delta. Despite increasing demand, no new dams have been built on the San Joaquin system in decades.",
      "On the west side of the valley, water comes from snowmelt in northern California\u2019s Cascade Range and northern Sierra, filling larger reservoirs like Oroville and Folsom. These reservoirs were designed to store water during wet years, ensuring a steady supply in average years and a backup for drought years.",
      "However, California has faced a prolonged dry spell, with little rain or snow in recent weeks, causing reservoir levels to drop.",
      "\"So when Gavin Newsom says, well, 'they're full,' they're not all full, but they're descending at a rapid rate, because he will not stop the releases to the ocean,\" Hanson said. \"They're still going on, as you and I speak, and they're not pumping 100% of it to the aqueduct, which serves agriculture in Los Angeles.\"",
      "During an interview with NBC earlier this week, Newsom claimed the reservoirs were full. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Newsom's office said he was referring to the state-managed reservoirs in Southern California.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has shifted the blame to local management and ordered an independent review of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.",
      "\"We need answers to how that happened,\" Newsom wrote to the department's director and the director of Los Angeles County Public Works on Jan. 10, regarding reports of lost water supply.",

      "For his part, Newsom also proposed allocating at least $2.5 billion in additional funding to bolster California's emergency response and recovery efforts in Los Angeles, his office announced on Monday.",
      "The proposed funding would support recovery and cleanup operations, enhance wildfire preparedness and assist in reopening schools closed due to the fires. The funding would come from the state's Disaster Response Emergency Operations Account, with $1.5 billion coming from speeding up the use of climate bond funds for immediate use, according to his office.",
      "There has been a slight increase in containment for the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires burning in Los Angeles County, according to a Wednesday night update from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",

      "The Eaton Fire in the Altadena/Pasadena area was at 45% containment as of Wednesday night. Both fires broke out on Jan. 7.",

Hurricane-force winds and unseasonably dry conditions drove these firestorms \u2013 misinformation surrounding this crisis has been staggering. Mayor Bass issued a sweeping executive order to clear the way to rebuild homes fast and that will do everything she can to get Angelenos back home.

      "Democrats at the hearing suggested they were concerned that Turner would slash federal funding for certain programs, such as HUD\u2019s Section 8 housing program and the agency's flagship HOME Investment Partnership Program. When probed about his approach to funding certain programs, Turner told Democrats he would work with them to review their concerns on a case-by-case basis but did not confirm one way or the other whether he would slash funding.",
      "\"The federal financing is a key part of financing housing, and affordable housing in Nevada,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez, D-Nev., said Thursday.",
      "\"We need to make some big changes,\" Warren added. \"To really move the needle, the federal government needs to be a good partner, investing in affordable housing and spurring local innovation to cut red tape.\"",
      "At one point during the hearing, Turner was asked about his support for work requirements for those receiving Section 8 housing assistance, telling committee members he thought it was a good idea. When Turner tried to explain his reasoning, he was cut off by the senator questioning him and unable to respond.",

      "In addition to their questions about funding HUD programs, Democrats also questioned Turner over whether he would work to remove alleged racial bias from the housing appraisal industry and whether he intends to go after \"price gouging\" from real estate investors. Again, Turner did not say \"no\" but said he would commit to looking into the issue with Democrats and make a determination from there. However, Turner did rail against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) requirements at HUD for housing grant applicants.",

Kennedy, Jr.",

      "\"I would allow him to intervene to ensure that we can reach the merits of respondents\u2019 claims and to prevent the irreparable loss of his First Amendment rights,\" he added.",
      "\"Because Mr. Kennedy\u2019s arguments on the merits are essentially the same as respondents\u2019, allowing intervention would not significantly affect petitioners\u2019 burden with regard to that issue,\" Alito wrote. \"But the denial of intervention is likely to prevent Mr. Kennedy from vindicating the rights he claims until the spring of 2024 and perhaps as late as June of that year.

      "It continued: \"We believe that differences in thought and belief, in race and religion, in orientation, and in ability contribute to more effective decision making, drive innovation, and enhance the employee experience. We know that a more diverse workforce allows us to connect with and maintain the trust of the American people. We also understand we have work to do. We stand committed, as today\u2019s FBI, to fostering a culture of inclusivity and diversity.\"",
      "Former FBI special agent and Fox News contributor Nicole Parker told Fox News Digital: \"I appreciate all forms of diversity. Make no mistake of that. What I do not appreciate is when there is a constant push for social justice weaponization at the FBI whose top priorities are to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution.\"",

      "Parker added, \"The FBI needs to focus on hiring the best and brightest based solely on meritocracy. Americans deserve the best. I have never been on an operation or heard of a civilian calling into the FBI and requesting an individual of a certain race or gender provide them with assistance in solving their problem or stopping a crime they've fallen victim to.

    "summary": "Researchers found in a study that users of a robotic prosthetic hand could successfully grasp and move two objects at once without dropping them.",
    "story": [
      "Study participants successfully grasped and transported two objects at once without dropping them.",
      "Prosthetic hands have long struggled to replicate the dexterity and functionality of natural hands, often limiting users to a single grasp function at a time.",
      "This limitation has made everyday tasks, such as typing on a keyboard or braiding hair, challenging for those who rely on prosthetics.",
      "However, a groundbreaking study from Florida Atlantic University (FAU) offers promising advancements that could transform the experience of prosthetic hand users.",

      "New technology enables users to grasp two objects at once",
      "Researchers at FAU's College of Engineering and Computer Science, in collaboration with the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, conducted an innovative study that combined haptic feedback, electromyogram control and a wearable soft robotic armband. This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",

      "NEW PROSTHETICS RESTORE NATURAL MOVEMENT VIA NERVE CONNECTION",
      "Multichannel soft robotic armband",
      "A key innovation in this research was the development of a multichannel soft robotic armband designed to convey artificial sensations of touch. This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Participants in the study reported that haptic feedback was significantly more important than visual feedback, especially since visual cues often failed to indicate when an object was about to be lost.

      "Implications for future prosthetic design",
      "The implications of this study extend beyond immediate user benefits; they suggest a paradigm shift in how prosthetic hands could be controlled in the future. By enabling refined dexterous control through enhanced sensory feedback, this research opens new pathways for individuals with upper limb loss to engage in complex tasks traditionally deemed impossible with current prosthetics. This includes activities such as playing musical instruments or performing intricate surgical procedures.",
      "In addition, the researchers noted that participants with limb loss performed as well as able-bodied subjects in key performance metrics during the tasks. This finding is particularly encouraging for clinical applications and indicates that advancements in technology can bridge gaps in functionality for users.",

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious BanShee Stealer.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",

      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access.

Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",

      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough.

If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",

      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

      "First responders are hard at work combating the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, while many members of the public question what could have caused the fires and if policy missteps hampered firefighting efforts. Kathryn Sorensen, who ran water and wastewater utilities for two major Arizona cities, says there are key facts about our water system that need to be understood.",
      "\"Municipal water utility systems really are not designed to fight large-scale wildfires,\" Sorensen told Fox News. \"They are designed with enough storage to meet demands under normal operating conditions and to fight a couple of relatively localized structure fires of a relatively short duration.\"",
      "Sorensen acknowledged that there are valid discussions to be had about the capacity of our current water systems and how they are used.",
      "\"If we\u2019re looking at a hotter, drier future, then we probably do need to take a look at these reservoirs, at their capacities, at their operational priorities, at how we\u2019re moving that water and for what purpose, and rethink that.\"",

      "The Santa Ynez Reservoir, located near the Palisades Fire, was revealed to have been empty since February 2024 and has become the focal point of a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). In the lawsuit, LADWP is accused of delaying repairs for the reservoir to cut costs, according to a Reuters report.",
      "In a statement, LADWP said it had shut down the reservoir to \"meet safe drinking water regulations\" and blamed delays to repairs on the city\u2019s \"competitive bidding process which requires time.\" Additionally, the agency said it would be conducting its own investigation.",
      "\"LADWP built the Pacific Palisades water system beyond the requirements to support the community\u2019s typical needs,\" LADWP wrote in a statement. \"As we face the impacts of climate change and build climate resilience, we welcome a review and update of these codes and requirements if city water systems will be used to fight extreme wildfires.\"",

      "\"Now, it\u2019s possible \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we have all the facts yet \u2013 it\u2019s possible that had the Santa Ynez Reservoir been full, it could\u2019ve provided additional water pressures up in these hillside pressure zones and could have made a difference for one or more structures, homes or businesses,\" Sorensen said.",

However, taxpayers have at times found themselves boxed out of shelters as immigrants have crowded the system and taken priority, said Jon Fetherston, who acted as a migrant shelter director at the Marlborough Holiday Inn between November 2023 and July of last year.",
      "Under its right-to-shelter law, established in 1983, the state must provide housing for displaced families and pregnant women. In 2023, the state's shelters reached their capacity of 7,500 enrolled families \u2013 yet migrants continue to use Massachusetts' programs.",

The woman told police that she had been living at the Quality Inn for three months and that she and Sanchez had obtained the room through a refugee program.",
      "\"I worked in that shelter for a very limited time,\" Fetherston told Fox News Digital. \"You can't hide an AR-15 in that room. You cannot hide drugs in that room. The rooms are not big\u2026 the case manager there should have been standing up\u2026 there should have been red flags\u2026 to say 'Hey, listen, this guy's not attending those meetings.

      "The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, which oversees the state's shelter program, told Fox News Digital that it has security guards at every facility and conducts warrant checks every 30 days. However, Fetherston did not see that activity during his tenure.",
      "\"I will tell you that all the shelters that I've either worked in and volunteered [at] do have a form of security. But\u2026 it's really basically somebody sitting at the desk \u2013\u00a0no better than you would have in a corporate office park\u2026 it's certainly not the level of security that you need in these shelters\u2026 I never saw anybody come in and do a warrant check.\"",

      "\"You hire people just because they can speak the language that you need, being either Haitian or, you know, Portuguese or Spanish. So you're not necessarily hiring a qualified caseworker or mental health advocate or somebody who's been experienced in navigating these things, because those people don't exist,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of times\u2026 the case managers became sympathetic to their fellow countrymen when they taught them how to navigate the system and not always in the most ethical ways. And that's where the chaos came down.\"",
      "Meanwhile, he said, there was \"a tremendous amount of domestic violence\u2026 a tremendous amount of violence towards children [and] a tremendous amount of violence towards other countrymen.\"",
      "Fetherston said residents' alleged friends and relatives would constantly cycle through the facility where he worked. Despite policies about residents coming through security, staffing was stretched so thin that actually keeping track of who was coming in and out was near impossible.",

      "\"[The Revere arrest] touch[es] the hot point [for me] from day three, maybe, of me being in the shelter,\" Fetherston said. \"'Who's that?\u2026 I didn't check them in. I didn't see them when they came in. Who were they?\u2026 How did this guy get past?' 'Well, that's so-and-so's uncle.'\"",
      "Oftentimes, he said, families would \"disappear\" \u2013 housekeeping would report that a family had not been in their room for three or four days. He would get calls about residents showing up at the facility, and they would never arrive, or a person whose ID did not match at all would show up.",
      "Since a ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in November of last year, after Fetherston left the shelter, shelters are not allowed to ask families for identification or documents when they are applying for its short-term shelter program.",
      "This distinction, he said, makes Democratic Gov. Maura Healey's recent call to further vet emergency shelter residents to ensure that they are in the U.S. legally, with rare exceptions, impossible.",
      "\"I believe these changes are appropriate and needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the state shelter system in a way that aligns with the original intent of the law,\" Healey said in a statement. \"In addition, these proposed changes will allow us to continue to ensure the safety of our system, support cities and towns in addressing the needs of unhoused families in their communities and put us on the path toward a more fiscally sustainable shelter system.\"",
      "\"She can say she will increase vetting, but how do you vet someone who has no ID? She also wants migrants to self-identify if they have committed crimes in the past \u2013 that's not going to happen,\" Fetherston said.",

      "Fetherston said he has had to turn away American citizens who had fallen on hard times amid the chaos at the state's migrant shelters.",

And I'm sending a decorated veteran out into the cold. At least half a dozen times I had to do that.\"",
      "He also said that, although there are technically limitations to how long one can stay in the state's shelters, they are not always enforced, and spots for citizens in need are not made available.",
      "\"You can't blame the people who stepped up and tried to do their job. You have to blame the system and the person running the system for not putting checks and balances,\" Fetherston said. \"The governor had no plan and she just wanted to get these shelters open\u2026 Nobody specializes in this \u2013 Massachusetts is the only state in the entire nation that has the right to shelter.

      "The National Transportation Safety Board released its preliminary report on Thursday into what went wrong at a Florida drone show last month that caused some of the aircraft to go rogue, leaving a little boy seriously injured.",
      "The mishap took place during a Christmas light show put on by Sky Elements at Lake Eola Park in Orlando on Dec. 21, 2024. Hundreds of people were watching the aerial show when several of the drones flew out of formation \u2013 some colliding with one another before falling to the ground.",
      "One of the rogue drones struck a 7-year-old boy in the face and chest, knocking him out upon impact. His parents told FOX 35 Orlando at the time that his injuries required open-heart surgery.",

      "A preliminary report into what went wrong at a Florida drone show on Dec. 21, 2024, has been released by the National Transportation Safety Board. There were 500 drones set up to fly in the aerial show above Lake Eola in Orlando, Florida. (Sky Elements LLC via NTSB report)",
      "Before the show, a remote pilot in command confirmed the setup was standard and \"consisted of preflight checks\" that ensured \"the software programming matched and was updated on all show computers, and the layout of the 500-drone grid on the ground,\" according to the report.",
      "Approximately five of the drones were \"not accepting the launch data\" initially, but troubleshooting of the Wi-Fi access points led to all 500 drones showing up on the network five minutes before the show was set to start, the NTSB wrote.",
      "A soft reboot was then conducted to ensure all drones were \"show ready.\" After the reboot, two drones were removed from the show because their systems were not showing green. Once they were taken out, the drones were armed and the countdown to liftoff was initiated.",
      "FAA PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON DRONE COMPANY AFTER FLORIDA BOY INJURED AT HOLIDAY AIRSHOW, UNDERWENT HEART SURGERY",
      "\"At liftoff it was noted that the aircraft \u2018layers\u2019 did not lift uniformly,\" the report stated. \"Further investigation revealed that the launch parameter file that contained the final flight paths had not been sent, and that the show center was not completely aligned.\"",
      "Several drones malfunctioned during a drone show in Orlando, Florida, on Dec. 21, 2024, sending the unmanned aerial objects crashing to the ground. (Credit - X/MosquitoCoFL)",
      "Because of the misalignment, the drones shifted positions and altitude when moving to the first frame of animation, causing a collision and loss of control. Numerous drones fell from the sky and hit the ground, while one went in the direction of the audience.",
      "The show's remote pilot in command told the NTSB that he determined the safest course of action was to continue the show based on the steps involved in pausing it and recovering drones from the air. The remaining drones were able to complete the show and land safely.",
      "A review by the pilot of aircraft logs revealed that the show's position had rotated by 7 degrees, resulting in the \"geo hard fence being too close to the audience.\" On top of that, the fence was not set to company standards of 1 meter and was instead at 5 meters.",
      "\"The combined errors resulted in a reduced safety area that was outside of the company\u2019s standards,\" the report noted.",
      "Each drone involved in the show contained an SD card with recorded data. Approximately 42 impacted drones were recovered by the operator, who sent their SD cards to be analyzed at the NTSB's Vehicle Recorder Lab. Law enforcement personnel also located one drone and sent it to the NTSB. Five drones believed to have fallen into the lake were not recovered.",

      "The FAA placed restrictions on Sky Elements, which puts on shows across the country, by suspending its waiver that allows for drone performances near crowds and at night.",

      "Heartbreaking images of minors at the southern border\u2014alone and clutching nothing but a piece of paper\u2014have become tragically familiar. According to border patrol data, since President Biden took office in 2021, nearly 540,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southern border. Many of these children fall prey to sex traffickers, facing unimaginable conditions and exploitation.",
      "Fox News recently spoke with a 20-year-old sex trafficking survivor, whose identity we agreed to conceal for his safety. He still lives in fear that his captors will find him. Trafficked from South America to Mexico and then across the border, he was finally rescued at the age of 18 and brought to Bob's House of Hope.",
      "Bob\u2019s House of Hope is the first safe house in the country dedicated specifically to male sex trafficking survivors. The victim shared harrowing details of his experience: trafficked six to eight times a day, beaten, and threatened with death if he dared to speak out.",

      "\"They just feel that it just happens to girls and women,\" Williams said. \"And that's the problem. That's the stigma that we have to change. The fact is that we believe up to 50% of human trafficking victims are boys and men.\"",
      "Bob\u2019s House of Hope welcomes both U.S. citizens and migrants. He works with law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and FBI.",
      "\"As a survivor, I said we are going to take anybody because these kids that are migrants are protected under the Federal Sex Trafficking Act,\" Williams explained.",

      "Williams describes a disturbing cycle: many migrants are labor trafficked during the day and then forced into sex trafficking at night.",
      "A common question he says he hears is, \"Why can\u2019t the boys escape?\" He explains that not only are they threatened with violence, but they are also controlled through addiction, specifically fentanyl.",
      "Around $4 million worth of fentanyl seized by the LAPD sits on a table. Human traffickers intentionally foster fentanyl addictions in their victims, which they then use as another method to control them, Bob Williams said. (LAPD)",
      "\"This fentanyl problem is so serious that they hook these young people on drugs,\" he said. \"That, combined with the fear of threats against their families, is controlling.\"",
      "A recent Office of Inspector General report revealed that ICE lost track of tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors in just the past few years. Williams expresses little doubt that many of these children have been trafficked.",
      "\"We know that a lot of these children were sold to gangs or trafficking groups by their families,\" he stated. \"Predators prey on vulnerable kids. We had a case where a young man was trying to reunite with his family in Florida and was picked up by a gang under the guise of providing a ride to Miami. But that ride never materialized.\"",

    "summary": "United Aerial Firefighters Association head Paul Petersen said the wildfires ravaging California could be among the most devastating in U.S. history, and hopes they &quot;wake up&quot; lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Paul Petersen, head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, said that wildfires raging in Southern California are among the deadliest and costly fires in U.S. history.",
      "The head of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, which has deployed about 200 pilots to Southern California to fight massive ongoing wildfires, told Fox News Digital that the scope of the fires is \"totally demoralizing\" and shaping up to be some of the worst in the nation's history.",
      "\"What we are seeing, especially in the United States and worldwide, is there is no longer a fire season \u2013 it is fire year-round,\" Paul Petersen said on Wednesday. \"[This] could end up being one of the deadliest and most climate-costliest fires in U.S. history.\"",
      "Aerial firefighters with the association are limited to eight-hour shifts in the air, like airline pilots. However, Petersen said, they are on 24-hour shifts. At night, he said, pilots are outfitted with night vision goggles. From the air, they communicate the position of the flames to firefighters on the ground and spray water or retardant substances from above.",
      "Among the aircraft supplied by the association are helicopters, like Blackhawks and ACH 47 Chinooks, and air tankers, like Grumman S-2T and Lockheed C-130H planes, carrying thousands of gallons of water. They also supply \"scooper\" planes, which \"scoop water from oceans, lakes and reservoirs which can be dropped as regular water or be mixed with a foam retardant,\" according to Cal Fire.",

      "These planes add to a huge fleet attempting to quell fires in Southern California. Cal Fire currently has over 60 planes and helicopters within its firefighting fleet; Cal Fire also counts three King Air A200 twin-turboprop planes among its \"air tactical aircraft.\" The Air National Guard has flown C-130 Hercules planes \"equipped with Modular Aerial Fire Fighting Systems\" to the Los Angeles area, where they are operating missions.",
      "\"I've seen just the pictures, and I've talked to fire chiefs that are down there \u2013 they [are] ensuring that the devastation is worse than what you see on TV, that it's worse than what you can imagine,\" he continued. \"And from a firefighter's perspective, it is just totally demoralizing because firefighters are there to solve problems and their people call them when it's their worst day.

The Palisades Fire, which has consumed more than 23,000 acres in the Los Angeles area, is only 19% contained, according to the agency.",

      "\"There's a couple of different components of [this],\" Petersen said of why these latest fires are so devastating. \"When you have extreme weather, and you have the Santa Ana winds that are blowing, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80 miles an hour, and then you introduce fire into that\u2026 it just moves so rapidly that people are unprepared for it.",
      "\"Communities that are unprepared for it, firefighters are surprised by it\u2026 When you start losing home after home and blocks after blocks after blocks, you're just trying to figure out how do we stop this? And, you know, there's really no playbook of how to stop a fire.\"",
      "Fox News Digital previously reported that the city's fire hydrants ran out of water as firefighters worked to stop the flames, and that the department's budget was slashed just weeks before the Palisades Fire broke out.",
      "\"Without increased funding for wildland fire, we're going to continue to see this over and over again,\" Petersen said. \"[It's] not only recognizing that it is a year-round fire season, but also having the funding and the money to invest not only for fire suppression, but for hazardous fuels, for hardening communities. U.S. needs to get it, you know, take this seriously, that you have to do all things in order to protect communities from wildfire.\"",

      "\"There is a huge need to look at local, state and federal levels to how do we really start to combat when fire and suppression is a big part of it,\" he continued. \"You got to fight. You have to fight the fire you have. But there also has to be fuel treatments, logging, grazing, green stripping. There also has to be incentives from insurance companies for fire-adapted communities. All three of those have to work and in one fell swoop in order to do that.\"",
      "\"It takes a tragedy for people to really wake up to this,\" Petersen said. \"And firefighters have been talking about this for 25 years, these problems that have been going on.\"",

      "Jairo Saenz, 28, is expected to receive a sentence of 40 to 60 years in federal prison after admitting to seven murders, multiple attempted murders, arson and other charges. Saenz's brother Alexi, another gang leader, previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in exchange for an expected sentence of 70 years behind bars.",
      "The Saenz brothers were the leaders of a Suffolk County, New York, branch of MS-13 known as the Sailors, according to federal authorities. Their group was known for extreme brutality and violence, including the murder of two Brentwood High School girls with a machete and a baseball bat.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer signed a 100-year partnership agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, part of a European show of support and promises to keep helping Ukraine endure in its nearly three-year war with Russia.",
      "The announcement came days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president with skepticism of America\u2019s military burden in Europe and what he says is a plan to end the continent\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.",
      "UK PM STARMER HITS BACK AGAINST MUSK ATTACKS ON CHILD GROOMING GANGS: 'LIES AND MISINFORMATION'",
      "\"We are with you not just today or tomorrow, for this year or the next, but for 100 years \u2014 long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again,\" Starmer told Zelenskyy during a visit to Kyiv, promising that the U.K. would \"play our part\" in guaranteeing Ukraine's post-war security.",
      "Starmer said that the landmark century-long agreement commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s alignment with the West, and potential future membership in NATO, have angered Russian President Vladimir Putin, who still wants to exert influence over the independent nation.",
      "While Starmer was meeting with Zelenskyy at the presidential palace, debris from Russian drones shot down by Ukraine\u2019s air defenses fell in at least four districts of Kyiv, according to city administration chief Tymur Tkachenko. One was close to the Baroque presidential palace where the two men met.",

      "Starmer said that the drones were \"a reminder\" of what the Ukrainian people are up against and their resolve.",
      "Starmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July, though he said that it was his seventh meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "The Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany\u2019s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy talked by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "The flurry of diplomatic activity came in the days leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration\u2019s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated that he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.",
      "Kyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Ukrainians worry that Trump\u2019s plan will demand unpalatable concessions, such as giving up territory. Zelenskyy has also said that he wants security guarantees to deter Russia from invading again in the future.",
      "\"We must look at how this war could end, the practical ways to get a just and lasting peace \u2026 that guarantees your security, your independence and your right to choose your own future,\" Starmer said at a joint news conference.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the two leaders had discussed an idea floated by Macron for Western troops to monitor a future ceasefire, but said that it\u2019s \"a bit too early to talk about details.\"",
      "Starmer left the door open to U.K. participation, telling Ukraine's leader that \"we will work with you and all of our allies on steps that would be robust enough to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security.\"",
      "\"Those conversations will continue for many months ahead,\" Starmer said.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously discussed a potential peacekeeping force with Baltic countries, France and Poland. But he said that it could only be part of the security solution and noted that \"we do not consider security guarantees without the United States.\"",
      "Starmer agreed that Washington's role in Ukraine is \"vital.\" The United States is the biggest provider of military support and advanced weaponry to the country.",
      "\"We will continue to work with the U.S. on this,\" Starmer said.",
      "Starmer said that in 2025, the U.K. will give Ukraine \"more military support than ever before.\" He said that his country has already committed 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) for military aid this year, including 150 more artillery barrels and a U.K.-designed mobile air defense system named Gravehawk. The U.K. has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in military and civilian aid since the war broke out.",
      "During the daylong visit, Starmer and Zelenskyy laid flowers at a wall of remembrance for those killed in the war. The wall outside St. Michael\u2019s Golden-Domed Monastery, a Kyiv landmark, is covered in photos of the slain, stretching for a city block. It has become a place of pilgrimage for families paying tribute to their lost loved ones.",
      "Starmer also visited a Kyiv hospital specializing in burns treatment and an exhibition of drone technology.",

Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.",
      "Moscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas.",

      "Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel \"will exact a very high price for any act of aggression against us from any quarter whatsoever.\" (Ma'ayan Toaf (GPO))",
      "When pressed by Fox News Digital for specifics on what issues have once again apparently stalled the deal set to be implemented on Sunday, Dostri pointed to renewed disagreements over the security corridor that runs between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.",
      "\"[Hamas is calling for] changing the deployment of Israeli military forces in the Philadelphia corridor,\" Dostri said without expanding on what deployment disagreements have occurred.",
      "The passage of land has repeatedly proved to be a sticking point in negotiations and may have contributed to the collapse of a July deal in which American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin was slated to be freed, but which never came to fruition. Golberg-Polin and five other hostages were then killed one month later in a tunnel in Gaza.",

But Israel also agreed to begin withdrawing its forces to a security zone surrounding the communities on the Gaza border, reported the Times of Israel.",

During that period, 33 hostages who fall under \"humanitarian categories\" including any possible children, women, the elderly and the sick will be freed first.",
      "The second phase, which will be negotiated on the 16th day of the cease-fire, will then involve the release of soldiers held by Hamas, both living and dead. Some reports have suggested that Israel could release more than 1,000 prisoners by the time the exchanges are through.",
      "Family members of Americans who were taken hostage by Hamas during the terrorist attacks in Israel on October 7, including (R-L) Ronen Neutra, Ruby Chen, Jonathan Dekel-Chen, Liz Naftali, Adi Alexander, Orna Neutra, and Yael Alexander talk to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House on December 13, 2023, in Washington, DC.

      "At least 60 bodies and 92 survivors had been pulled from one of South Africa's deepest mines since Monday in a red cagelike device lowered thousands of feet underground, police said. Police are uncertain how many miners remain inside but said it is likely in the hundreds. Another nine bodies were brought out Friday in a community-led rescue effort, according to a group representing the miners.",
      "DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 13 IN SOUTH AFRICA MINING DISASTER",
      "The mine has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since authorities launched an operation in November to force the miners out by cutting off food and water from the surface for a period of time. At the time, a Cabinet minister said the aim was to \"smoke them out\" and the government would not send help because they were \"criminals.\"",
      "But that tactic has been fiercely criticized by civic groups and the community, and the South African government is under scrutiny for the way it has dealt with the issue at the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, where more than 100 miners are believed to have died underground of starvation or dehydration, according to the group representing them.",

      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",

      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",

      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \"a minimum\" of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \"This is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\" as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \"Please help us. Bring us food or take us out.\"",
      "The rescue operation will go on for 10 days and authorities would then reassess, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said. Police also said that the survivors who had been brought to the surface will be arrested and charged with illegal mining and trespassing after receiving medical attention.",

The weakening of Iran, due to conflicts in the Middle East and internal issues, has diminished its influence over the Taliban. At the same time, Russia, one of India's closest allies, is moving toward recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, even calling the group a partner in combating terrorism.

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0Kristi Noem, is set to go before a Senate committee for a confirmation hearing Friday. But even if she is successful at the hearing and is confirmed, as she is expected to be, her role\u00a0as homeland security secretary is expected to be more limited in scope than her predecessors\u2019, sources familiar with the Trump transition told NBC News.",
      "If she is confirmed,\u00a0Noem, the governor of\u00a0South Dakota,\u00a0will oversee a workforce of more than 260,000\u00a0across a number of agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. But\u00a0on the issue in her purview that is highest-profile and most important to Trump, immigration,\u00a0she would be taking marching orders from the White House,\u00a0specifically\u00a0from incoming border czar Tom Homan and\u00a0Stephen Miller, the deputy\u00a0chief of\u00a0staff for\u00a0policy, four sources familiar with the transition preparations said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about transition discussions.",
      "Previous homeland security\u00a0secretaries have been involved in Cabinet-level discussions about immigration policy and\u00a0have advised\u00a0the presidents they served on the realities of carrying out policies on the ground. They have also set the priorities for how to conduct immigration enforcement.",
      "Noem is not considered a key player in planning mass deportations, a major campaign promise of Trump\u2019s, as that is seen largely to be the focus of Homan and Miller, the sources said. She has not been vocal about the issue, nor has she made national media appearances since Trump announced her as his choice to head DHS shortly after he won the White House in November.\u00a0But if there are policy questions from Congress, she would be the one to answer them.",
      "Follow live confirmation hearing coverage",
      "In response to a query about Noem\u2019s role in immigration policy, the transition team said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump was elected to secure America\u2019s borders. As President Trump\u2019s choice to be DHS Secretary, Governor Noem will ensure that CBP, ICE, and USCIS, critical immigration agencies under her purview, have what\u2019s necessary to protect our borders and keep Americans safe.\u201d",
      "The transition team also noted that the Border Patrol union endorsed Noem in a letter to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearing. \u201cWe are confident that as Secretary, Governor Noem will continue to ensure Border Patrol agents have the resources and manpower that we need to secure our border,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Noem\u2019s spokesperson in the governor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager and a longtime Noem ally,\u00a0is involved in hiring for key positions within the new DHS, even though he is not an official part of the DHS transition, three of the sources said. Two of them said that has been frustrating for people within the Trump transition whose jobs are supposed to be hiring for the department. One of the sources called Lewandowski\u2019s role \u201coutsized\u201d and \u201cabnormal,\u201d while another called it \u201cunusual.\u201d",

      "Though Noem\u2019s role in immigration policy might be limited, DHS\u2019 responsibility to secure critical infrastructure, respond to natural disasters, prevent terrorist attacks and protect the president and other dignitaries would ultimately fall to her if she is confirmed.",
      "Critics, including Democrats and Native American tribes in her state, as well as some senators, have argued that as governor of South Dakota, a state far from the U.S. southern border with only 5% of the workforce of DHS, Noem lacks the right experience to run DHS.",
      "Doug Sombke, a South Dakota farmer and president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, who has been a frequent critic of Noem, said she was not qualified to run DHS. \u201cGood God, no, she can\u2019t run the state,\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "Noem has come under fire most recently for the state auditor\u2019s denial of an open records request for her government-issued credit card.\u00a0The auditor told The Dakota Scout newspaper of Sioux Falls that the records could not be released because it could violate her safety.\u00a0The newspaper has sued to get the records.",
      "Fellow Republicans have also criticized her for\u00a0spending $13 million in taxpayer money on a shooting range project that the Legislature had rejected.",
      "\u201cThe Legislature objected to the spending, and the governor approved it anyway,\u201d Sombke said.",
      "Noem\u2019s backers applaud her tough stance on immigration. She has called\u00a0for\u00a0so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE to be punished. And she sent South Dakota\u00a0National\u00a0Guard members to the border to address what she has called an immigrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d",
      "\u201cKristi has been very strong on Border Security,\u201d Trump said in a statement in November announcing her as his choice to run DHS. \u201cShe will work closely with Border Czar Tom Homan to secure the Border and will guarantee that our American Homeland is secure from our adversaries.\u201d",
      "Other issues likely to come up in Noem\u2019s hearing before the\u00a0Senate committee Friday are her revelation in a recently published memoir that she shot and killed her family dog when she considered it \u201cuntrainable.\u201d\u00a0Another is\u00a0a 2022 South Dakota state legislative committee\u2019s finding that Noem\u2019s daughter\u00a0Kassidy Peters\u00a0received special treatment when she was given her real estate appraisal license.\u00a0A\u00a0state agency awarded the license in 2020 despite Peters\u2019 failure to obtain training that was required, the legislative committee found.",

    "story": [
      "This weekend's divisional round of the NFL playoffs features two quarterbacks in remarkably similar positions. Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens are the leading MVP candidates this season.",
      "Both signal callers are seeking their first Super Bowl appearances as they have both been unable to get past Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs. They are also dual threats: Jackson led all quarterbacks this year with 915 rushing yards. Allen was fifth with 531.",
      "The two face each other Sunday in arguably the marquee game of the weekend, which also features the Chiefs hosting the Houston Texans and the Detroit Lions and the Washington Commanders on Saturday. Sunday's other contest is between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "With a multitude of storylines to watch, NBC News\u2019 Rohan Nadkarni and Andrew Grief and NBC Sports\u2019 Patrick Daugherty are here to break it down from every angle.",
      "Lamar Jackson faces Josh Allen on Sunday night. Who is your NFL MVP?",
      "Nadkarni: I feel pretty confident in saying Jackson is the MVP, and it\u2019s not a particularly difficult decision. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t close or that Allen doesn\u2019t have a good case. At the same time, Jackson has more passing yards, a higher completion percentage, more passing touchdowns, fewer interceptions, more rushing yards and more total touchdowns. The Bills\u2019 superior record does not matter to me, because the AFC East was not very good. And while Derrick Henry has been a boon to the Ravens\u2019 backfield, it\u2019s not like every quarterback who played with him puts up Lamar numbers.",
      "Greif:\u00a0I think this is a true toss-up, and it must be acknowledged, too, that the presence of Henry at running back made Jackson\u2019s job easier.\u00a0And yet Jackson, to me, pulled off something no other MVP candidate did \u2014 dramatically improve upon what was already an elite skill set.\u00a0Already a two-time MVP, Jackson this season looked like a completely different passer. His percentage of on-target passes was 8 percentage points higher than his career average; he threw a career-high number of passes yet threw a career-low four interceptions, and even then, none of those interceptions could be attributed to a poor throw or decision by Jackson.",
      "Daugherty: It\u2019s Jackson. I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that it\u2019s a bit crazy Jackson could end up with his third MVP while Allen has zero, but just as players can only play the game in front of them, voters can only vote the season in front of them. Jackson somehow ascended to his most stratospheric statistical heights yet this season, achieving ludicrous levels of efficiency while, you know, leading the league with 47 total touchdowns. The Ravens averaged 6.85 yards per play, the second most in NFL history.",
      "Jackson\u2019s past MVP wins and \u201cfairness\u201d shouldn\u2019t really matter. Was he the best player or not? His statistical case is unassailable, and the Bills\u2019 one extra regular-season victory is hardly enough to swing the argument in Allen\u2019s favor, especially since Jackson\u2019s Ravens roughed the Bills up in their head-to-head matchup. Despite their MVP disparity, you could still argue Allen has had the better career. You can\u2019t argue who had the better season.",
      "What team do you feel differently about after the wild-card round?",
      "Greif:\u00a0The Rams. By the eye test and statistics, their defense profiled as one that might struggle. And the team was playing only days after wildfires devastated Los Angeles, not far from where the team practices. Instead, their pressure and focus absolutely wrecked Minnesota. Dismiss coach Sean McVay\u2019s playoff chances at your own peril.",
      "Daugherty: The Rams. You can debate whether the Rams\u2019 wild-card roughhousing of the Vikings said more about the winner or loser. What is inarguable is that it was yet another playoff game where McVay looked like the most prepared coach this side of Bill Belichick. Relentlessly exploiting the Vikings\u2019 weaknesses while leaning on his strengths, McVay took the approach every coach espouses but few achieve: one play at a time. As the Rams stacked victories one by one, the Vikings spiraled out of control, having no answer for McVay\u2019s game-planning mastery. This is far from McVay\u2019s best squad. It\u2019s also his first without Aaron Donald. It has still proven it deserves \u201cany given Sunday\u201d respect thanks to its deep well of experience and unmatched preparation.",
      "Nadkarni: I picked the Rams to upset the Vikings in this space last week, and even still I\u2019m marveling at the performance they had in the wild-card round. Los Angeles flat-out dominated on both sides of the ball. Watching the Rams\u2019 defensive line against the Eagles\u2019 offensive line is the matchup of the divisional round for me. Los Angeles wasn\u2019t particularly elite during the season in terms of pass-rush win rate, and yet its defensive line mounted pressure on Sam Darnold even when rushing only four. If the Rams can get ahead early and make Jalen Hurts uncomfortable in the pocket, that game becomes a lot more interesting.",
      "Which underdog this weekend has the best chance at an upset?",
      "Daugherty: The Rams. The Eagles forced four turnovers against the Packers and still won only 22-10. It was a one-score game for the first half of the fourth quarter. It was the same story for several months: dominating defense, questionable offense. That\u2019s not great news with McVay\u2019s opportunistic Rams headed for Philly.",
      "The Eagles feasted on Jordan Love\u2019s inexperience and the Packers\u2019 nerves. That\u2019s not going to be an option vs. Los Angeles. When the Eagles\u2019 offense is humming, the Rams are not capable of winning a shootout. We saw that in Philly\u2019s 37-20 victory in Week 12. When Jalen Hurts is struggling and the defense can focus all of its attention on Saquon Barkley, however, the calculus quickly changes. If it\u2019s another 13 completions for 121 yards kind of day for the Eagles\u2019 quarterback, McVay\u2019s Rams will be well-positioned for their second straight upset.",
      "Nadkarni: Picking the Bills \u2014 a very slim underdog at home \u2014 feels like cheating. So I\u2019m going to make an argument on behalf of the Houston Texans. Look, the Texans didn\u2019t exactly wow anyone in the wild-card round when they won a wacky game against the Los Angeles Chargers. But Houston\u2019s defense is absolutely ferocious, with a defensive line and a secondary that wreaks havoc on opposing offenses. Several quarterbacks have looked awful against the Texans this year. And C.J. Stroud, despite his so-so sophomore year, is still proving to be a game changer at the position. Add all this to the Chiefs\u2019 very long layoff and their own offensive malaise this season, and I\u2019m at least expecting a tight game because of Houston\u2019s defense.",
      "Greif:\u00a0At one point this week the Bills were a slight underdog, but as a team that finished 8-0 at home and has beaten the top seeds in each conference, they don\u2019t feel like much of an underdog\u00a0against Baltimore, even though the Ravens have already beaten Buffalo once this season.",
      "Underrated storyline you\u2019re watching",
      "Nadkarni: Can a storyline be underrated if you wrote about it? I will have my eye on the fourth-down attempts between the Lions and the Commanders, though, because I believe the aggressive natures of both teams are going to play a massive role Saturday. Washington went for it on fourth down five times against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while Detroit has been the face of fourth-down aggression since Dan Campbell took over in 2021. Will either of these coaches blink in a big moment? Could the game turn on a failed fourth-down attempt? That will be the game-within-the-game when these teams face off, and it should add a decent dose of drama.",
      "Greif:\u00a0When Houston faces Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, can its defense make life miserable for yet another top quarterback? Already this season the Texans\u2019 scheme has led Buffalo\u2019s Allen to post a career-worst completion percentage, Detroit\u2019s Jared Goff to throw five interceptions and Miami\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa to throw three interceptions and lose a fumble. The latest data point came in Houston\u2019s wild-card playoff victory last week against the Chargers, when Justin Herbert was intercepted four times \u2014 the same Herbert who had thrown three interceptions in his previous 17 games.",
      "Daugherty: You would think the two-time defending Super Bowl champions\u2019 beginning their quest for a threepeat as 15-2 home favorites would be the storyline of the divisional round. Alas, the Chiefs find themselves well behind the Bills and Ravens\u2019 \u201cgame of the century\u201d and the Lions\u2019 hunt for the first Super Bowl title in franchise history. So I\u2019ll ask: Can the Chiefs win convincingly after an anything but convincing 2024?",
      "Because let\u2019s be real: The Chiefs are going to win. The only question is if they will do so in a fashion that actually makes them favorites for the AFC championship game. You can lean on your \u201cchampionship pedigree\u201d when you are grinding out regular season victories over the Chargers and the Steelers. The same is true for the Texans in the divisional round. But Baltimore or Buffalo with the Lamar Hunt Trophy on the line? We are going to need to see some proof it\u2019s possible this Saturday."

    "summary": "The Biden administration on Friday released its next round of prescription drugs selected for Medicare price negotiations, which includes Ozempic.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration on Friday released the next round of prescription drugs selected for Medicare price negotiations, including Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 the blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs.\u00a0The drugs have faced public backlash over their high price, fueling demand for cheaper alternatives.",
      "The list, which includes 15 drugs, up from 10 last year, is the first step in a negotiation process between Medicare and drugmakers that is expected to take place over the coming months.\u00a0The new negotiated prices won\u2019t take effect until 2027.",
      "Still, the deliberations\u00a0\u2014 mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \u2014\u00a0face an uncertain future under the incoming Trump administration, which has remained silent on whether it supports the government program.",
      "The drugs selected to undergo negotiations are:",
      "Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy, for Type 2 diabetes and weight loss.",
      "Trelegy Ellipta, an asthma\u00a0treatment.",
      "Xtandi, for prostate cancer.",
      "Pomalyst, a chemotherapy drug.",
      "Ibrance, a breast cancer drug.",
      "Ofev, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",
      "Linzess, a chronic constipation drug.",
      "Calquence, a cancer drug.",
      "Austedo; Austedo XR, for Huntington\u2019s disease.",
      "Breo Ellipta, a COPD drug.",
      "Tradjenta, a diabetes drug.",
      "Xifaxan, for diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome.",
      "Vraylar, an antipsychotic drug.",
      "Janumet; Janumet XR, diabetes drugs.",
      "Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug.",
      "Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, said the stakes for the government to get a good deal this year are high.",
      "A survey from KFF published Friday found that more than half of the public says it\u2019s a \u201ctop priority\u201d to expand the number of prescription drugs subject to negotiations, including nearly half of Republicans.",
      "Ozempic and similar drugs are in high demand, and as Medicare begins to cover the drugs for other FDA-approved uses, such as heart disease risk, the cost to taxpayers is expected to increase. (Currently, Medicare is barred from covering the drugs for weight loss.)\u00a0\u201cDriving a hard bargain at the negotiating table could potentially save Medicare billions of dollars in the coming years,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "The drugmakers will have a little more than a month to agree to participate in the negotiations, or they may face tax penalties. The only way to avoid the tax is to pull the drug from the Medicare program entirely, a move that would cut them off from a huge share of the market.",
      "A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services official said on a call that the government will begin reaching out to the drugmakers later Friday to provide information on the negotiation process.",
      "Asked whether the incoming Trump administration could pause or make changes to the negotiations, the official said, \"If they were to make changes in the future, it would require additional program guidance, potential rulemaking and potentially new information collection requests.\"",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said the drugmaker remains opposed to the pricing negotiations. Still, the spokesperson said, it will work with the incoming administration to \"deliver meaningful solutions for patients.\"",
      "About 5.3 million people on Medicare used the drugs between Nov. 1, 2023, and Oct. 1, 2024, according to the CMS.",
      "Together, the 15 drugs selected accounted for $41 billion, or 14%, of total Medicare Part D spending. When combined with the first 10 drugs already negotiated by Medicare, they account for a third of all Part D spending, according to CMS. Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs that people take themselves, as opposed to those administered in a facility, such as chemotherapy.",
      "\"We have a chance to negotiate a better deal for the American people,\" outgoing Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Xavier Becerra said on a call with reporters. \"This is a big deal. Some folks have to cut their pills in half or skip a dose in their prescription so that they can make their prescription last longer.\"",
      "Last year, Medicare reached agreements to lower prices on the 10 costliest drugs, including Eliquis, a blood thinner; Imbruvica, a blood cancer treatment; and NovoLog, a diabetes medication.",
      "The new prices for those drugs are set to take effect in 2026.",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said the inclusion of Ozempic this year is \u201ca big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis has major budget implications for Medicare beneficiaries, Part D plans, and taxpayers because it could greatly expand the use of these drugs among Medicare beneficiaries over time,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cThis could result in premium increases if the number of eligible beneficiaries started using these products for weight loss since the products need to be used chronically.\u201d",
      "The drug industry has fiercely fought the program through lawsuits but has so far been unsuccessful."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:40:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to appoint his lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to the Senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance, two sources with knowledge of the decision told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to appoint his lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to the Senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance, two sources with knowledge of the decision told NBC News.",
      "The sources, who were granted anonymity to share details of private discussions, said the announcement is scheduled to come at a 1 p.m. Friday news conference that DeWine has called at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.",
      "A spokesperson for DeWine declined to comment about the agenda for the news conference. A Husted spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Husted, who would serve at least through a 2026 special election to fill the remaining two years of Vance\u2019s term, had recently emerged as a leading contender. DeWine had said appointing someone who could win a competitive Republican primary next year was among his chief considerations.",
      "The decision comes on the heels of Vance\u2019s resignation and follows a meeting that DeWine and Husted had last month with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "Husted\u2019s interest in succeeding DeWine as governor in 2026, and the possibility of Husted being endorsed by Trump, was a topic of conversation, two sources briefed on the meeting told NBC News. But Trump made no commitments to Husted on that race or on the Senate vacancy, these sources said.",
      "The imminent Husted appointment follows a late push from biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a close Trump ally who lives in the Columbus area.",
      "Ramaswamy last fall took himself out of the running for the post after agreeing to lead the new Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. But he had signaled a change of heart recently and met with DeWine about the appointment.",
      "Others who were in the mix to succeed Vance included former state GOP chair Jane Timken, state Treasurer Robert Sprague, Rep. Mike Carey and former state Rep. Jay Edwards.",
      "Signal Ohio first reported that DeWine had settled on Husted.",
      "Trump is a political force in Ohio, where he has won three times by comfortable margins. He and DeWine were on opposite sides of last year\u2019s GOP primary for the state\u2019s other Senate seat \u2014 a race in which DeWine backed a state lawmaker loathed by much of Trump world over Trump-endorsed businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "Moreno easily won the primary and went on to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has not ruled out running in next year\u2019s special election for Vance\u2019s old seat.",
      "DeWine and Husted have been allies since they ran together in 2018. Husted had plans to seek the governorship that year, as well, but he agreed to join DeWine\u2019s ticket as lieutenant governor.",
      "Despite their close relationship, Husted, 57, has tried to navigate his own path in the party. He endorsed Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid hours before last year\u2019s Iowa caucuses and has been close with Ramaswamy.",
      "Ramaswamy\u2019s potential interest in the 2026 race for governor, combined with Trump\u2019s reluctance to issue an early endorsement of Husted, likely factored into Husted\u2019s decision on whether to accept DeWine\u2019s Senate appointment. Other prominent Republicans, including Sprague and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, also have been preparing campaigns for governor, threatening to further crowd the field."

    "story": [
      "The swing voters who helped President-elect Donald Trump return to the White House are feeling optimistic about the next four years, but they\u2019ll be watching to see whether their desire for change becomes a reality.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that some change will come from this, at least a little bit. I hope some of the prices will go down,\u201d said Reagan Spiegel, 19, a farmhand from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who voted for the first time in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about all these things that people want to do and then they don\u2019t commit to actually doing them,\u201d Spiegel added, optimistic Trump will be able to deliver on his agenda.",
      "Spiegel is among the voters who helped propel Trump to victory in November, as he won over first-time voters and a decisive slice of others who had cast their ballots for Joe Biden in 2020. NBC News spoke this week to 18 of those voters who had participated in the final NBC News poll of the 2024 election.",
      "As a group, they are largely willing to give Trump some leeway when it comes to fulfilling his major campaign promises, like bringing down prices of everyday goods like groceries.\u00a0Many of them haven't been closely following his Cabinet nominations or other actions during the transition, though some comments, like his discussion of annexing other countries' territory, have broken through.",
      "\u201cI won on the border, and I won on groceries,\u201d Trump said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month, adding later, \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d",
      "But Trump has also acknowledged that it will be difficult to do that, telling Time magazine after the election that it will be \u201cvery hard\u201d to bring prices down. But the swing voters who supported him acknowledge that, too, and several said they would still support him even if prices don\u2019t decline.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not expecting him to get the prices down,\u201d said Rebecca, 48, an independent voter from Rhode Island. \u201cI\u2019m just expecting him to be fair.\u201d",
      "Rebecca voted for Trump after having backed Biden four years ago, noting that the economy, immigration and safety were her top issues. As a bartender, she was drawn to Trump\u2019s pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, and she said she\u2019s hopeful Trump can help boost wages even if he can\u2019t lower prices.",
      "Karley, 40, an Ohio voter who noted that she would still support Trump even if prices don\u2019t decline, said, \u201cHe can only do so much.\u201d She backed Trump in November but didn\u2019t vote in 2020, missing the deadline to cast a mail ballot as she juggled a newborn.",
      "Melanie Phillips, 56, a software engineer from Utah who voted for the first time in November, said, \u201cI do understand that it isn\u2019t something that can happen overnight.\u201d",
      "Phillips believed the Biden administration was trying to stymie Trump\u2019s anti-inflation efforts, pointing to the recent announcement that the White House would cancel federal student loan debt for more than 150,000 borrowers.",
      "But others are looking for Trump to follow through on his promise to address inflation. Jorge, 21, an independent Florida voter who supported Trump in his first presidential election, said failure to bring down prices would be \u201ca disappointment, to say the least.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be the same as Democrats who overpromised, underdelivered,\u201d Jorge said.",
      "\u2018We needed something to happen\u2019",
      "These voters said they ultimately backed Trump after they concluded that Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party were out of touch and not focused on the issues that mattered to them, like high prices and their personal financial struggles, border security and public safety.",
      "\u201cWe were treading water over here. ... You can only tread so long before you feel like you\u2019re sinking. And Biden didn\u2019t prove to do anything, anything, nothing. It was just a stagnant time,\u201d said Rebecca, the Rhode Island bartender, who declined to share her last name.",
      "\u201cWe needed something to happen,\u201d she said later.",
      "Mariana, 21, a Hispanic woman from Texas, said she was initially \u201cscared\u201d of Trump\u2019s tough stance on immigration when he first ran for office in 2016. But she said she \u201cpartially\u201d supports his plans for mass deportations.",
      "\u201cI feel like those immigrants that pay their taxes and they contribute in a good way to our country, they shouldn\u2019t be deported,\u201d Mariana said. \u201cI just feel like it should be all the people that [are] taking advantage, committing crimes.\u201d",
      "Scott, a computer programmer from Missouri, said \u201creal people\u201d are \u201cangry\u201d about the state of the country.",
      "\u201cNone of the politicians seem to be angry in that way, but Trump was,\u201d said Scott, a Hispanic gay man and former Democrat. He said he no longer felt heard by his former party, suggesting Democrats focused too much on social issues like diversity.",
      "In other words, voters like Scott are looking for Trump to shake up Washington.",
      "\u201cOn all levels, government has been so bogged down by \u2018we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t do that.\u2019 Trump says: \u2018Hey I don\u2019t care. I really don\u2019t care what norms or institutions are going to say,\u2019\u201d Scott said, adding later, \u201cIt seems like that\u2019s the only option at this point, because the respect for the guidelines has stopped them from doing anything.\u201d",
      "Some voters are confident Trump can follow through on his promises, pointing to his business experience and first term in office as evidence that he can repair the economy.",
      "\u201cAs far as I know, he hasn\u2019t held a lot of political offices, but he\u2019s a good businessman,\u201d said Janice Dunn, 83, a Trump voter from New Bern, North Carolina. \u201cYou need a good business head when you\u2019re dealing with all of this.\u201d",
      "Dunn, a registered Democrat who considers herself a Republican, said that she didn\u2019t vote in 2016 or 2020 because of mobility issues but that she would have voted for Trump if she had the chance. While she doesn\u2019t think of either Trump or Harris as \u201cgood people,\u201d she said, she\u2019s hopeful Trump will make headway on key issues like the economy and immigration.",
      "Others are just looking for Trump to try something to address their concerns about the economy, border security and public safety, even if he doesn\u2019t succeed.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m particularly expecting him to do something,\u201d said Ray, an Asian man in his mid-30s from New York who voted for Biden in 2020. \u201cBut what I think he does do, whether it\u2019s kind of true or not, is he at least makes an effort to reach out to those people, people like me, and he is kind of saying that, yeah, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d",
      "Honeymoon period",
      "Many of these voters are ready to give Trump some leeway, not just with his campaign trail promises but also as he grabs headlines on other issues, like his recent comments about taking over Greenland, the Panama Canal and Canada.",
      "A few swing voters were perplexed by his annexation comments, and some said he shouldn\u2019t be focused on that. But most weren\u2019t concerned about them, and some were even supportive.",
      "\u201cIf we take care of them financially, why shouldn\u2019t they be a part of us?\u201d said Gonzell Turner, 40, an electrician from Maryland who backed Trump after having supported Biden in 2020.",
      "Others dismissed the comments as Trump being Trump.",
      "\u201cI think Trump, as a person, he\u2019ll say one thing today, and he\u2019ll say the complete opposite tomorrow,\u201d said Ray, from New York. \u201cIt really just matters what he ends up acting on.\u201d",
      "Jordan, 28, a California voter, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think his main priority is going to be: We\u2019re taking Canada or Greenland.\u201d She said that she is \u201cnot a big Trump supporter\u201d but that she backed him because of her concerns about border security and because she viewed the Democratic Party as inauthentic.",
      "These voters were also largely unaware of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks or indifferent about them, with some saying Trump should be able to pick his own team.",
      "\u201cLet him make his decisions with that,\u201d said Rebecca, the Rhode Island voter, who described Cabinet picks as \u201cinside stuff.\u201d",
      "The deference to Trump over his Cabinet and the leeway when it comes to fulfilling his campaign promises underscore how Trump, like other incoming presidents, is kicking off his next administration with a honeymoon period of sorts with these swing voters.",
      "But they could still be up for grabs in four years, although Democrats have some work to do to win them over.",
      "Javan Potts, 23, an Amazon driver from Ohio, said he is still open to supporting Democratic candidates. Potts voted for Trump and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost his re-election bid.",
      "\u201cBe real, be honest,\u201d Potts advised Democrats. \u201cReally, don\u2019t just choose what\u2019s trendy and what you think people want to emotionally tie to but what people in reality need.\u201d"

A sixth defendant was being arraigned separately in juvenile court.",
      "Police said Brainard\u2019s Tinder account was used to lure the man to the private, Roman Catholic school in Worcester. She faces an additional charge of witness intimidation. A male student in the group also faces a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.",
      "The target \u2014 a 22-year-old active-duty military service member \u2014 told police he was in town for his grandmother\u2019s funeral in October and \u201cjust wanted to be around people that were happy,\u201d according to a campus police report. So he turned to Tinder, where a woman whose profile said she was 18 invited him over.",

      "Randall told officers they were inspired by the \u201ccatch a predator\u201d trend, which he said \u201cis big on TikTok\u201d at the moment. He said their group shared ideas of what to tell the man through the Tinder app to lure him to campus, and then spread word through a dormitory chat group that a \u201cpredator\u201d was in the building, the report said.",

All of this was false, campus police concluded after reviewing surveillance recordings and finding that \u201cfirst person perspective videos\u201d were being circulated among students.",

    "summary": "The Colorado apartment complex where armed alleged members of a Venezuelan gang were seen on video breaking into an occupied unit will be closed.",
    "story": [
      "DENVER \u2014 The apartment complex where armed alleged members of a Venezuelan gang were seen on video breaking into an occupied unit, fueling Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to target migrants, has been ordered closed by the city of Aurora, Colorado.",
      "The Edge at Lowry will close sometime next month after the city was granted an emergency court order to shut down the five-building complex because it has become a criminal nuisance, city spokesman Ryan S. Luby said Wednesday.",
      "The city filed the petition last week after several armed and suspected members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang also known as TDA, were alleged to have kidnapped, bound and pistol-whipped two people at the complex last month.",
      "City officials did not say what set off the dispute.",
      "\u201cWe needed to get ahold of that property because it was being completely unmanaged,\u201d City Attorney Pete Schulte said at a news conference this week. \u201cNobody at that premise is going to prevent individuals from committing crimes.\u201d",
      "He said the complex and its intruders posed an imminent threat to the public\u2019s welfare and safety.",
      "Nine of the 16 people involved in the alleged kidnapping are charged with various counts, including first-degree assault, aggravated robbery and extortion, the Aurora Police Department said in a statement.",
      "It was unclear whether any of the 16 were gang members. Police said all were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "About 60 units in the complex are occupied, including some vacant apartments that gang members and squatters are using illegally, city officials said, adding that they are\u00a0working with Arapahoe County and other community partners to provide relocation assistance for legitimate residents.",
      "During an investigation, officers found guns hidden in the walls of some units, city officials said. Records indicate officers searched five apartments on Dec. 17 and found at least three handguns, extended magazines and multiple knives.",
      "The building is owned by Five Dallas Partners LLC and operated by CBZ Management LLC. Neither responded to requests by phone and email for comment.",
      "The apartment buildings drew national attention in August when a viral video surfaced of armed suspected gang members breaking into an occupied unit.",
      "Trump, then on the campaign trail, took aim at Aurora, claiming the city had been overtaken by Venezuelan gangs, and he repeatedly claimed during a presidential debate that the TDA had taken over the apartments.",
      "Weeks later, during a campaign rally in Aurora, Trump revealed his plans to target undocumented gang members in the mass deportations he said would begin once he took office. He called his initiative \u201cOperation Aurora.\u201d",
      "At the time, local authorities acknowledged the gang had a small presence in the city, but they insisted it had not taken over the complex. Some residents agreed the allegations were overblown, but others said they believed it was happening.",
      "As of July 2024, there were 435,719 convicted criminal immigrants in the U.S. who were not under Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detention, according to the federal agency. It did not say how many of them may have been gang members.",
      "The alleged kidnapping last month sealed the fate of the Edge at Lowry, which city officials called a distressed property with many \u201cunlawful tenants who moved into vacant apartments without applying for a lease or application.\u201d",
      "Mayor Mike Coffman declined to comment.",
      "At the news conference announcing the closing, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said, \u201cThe city of Aurora has seen a major problem that\u2019s been infecting our community.\u201d He said the property was \u201ccrime-infested.\u201d",
      "Jessica Prosser, Aurora\u2019s director of Housing and Community Services, said the property is uninhabitable, citing trash abatement orders and $70,000 in outstanding water, utilities and gas bills."

      "\u201cIt was the feeling of being able to go back to a character and kind of revisit an old friend of yours,\u201d Jackson told NBC News. \u201cIn the first one, Donnie is so under the radar. He\u2019s so, just, out of the way, you don\u2019t really want to pay too much attention to him. In this one, people know what to expect from Donnie, so there\u2019s no more hiding, and you have to bring his personality and his attitude, mindset, to the forefront. That\u2019s exciting to do.\u201d",
      "Produced by Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson, \u201cDen of Thieves 2\u201d is the follow-up to the first film, in which a group of thieves pulls off a heist of the heavily surveilled L.A. Federal Reserve, thwarting hard-nosed cop Big Nick, played by Butler. Jackson\u2019s Donnie, the heist\u2019s driver, emerged as the hero who escaped to London. And he\u2019s still the hero \u2014 or more accurately the antihero \u2014 in the sequel.",
      "Keeping his talents in Europe, Donnie from L.A. has transformed himself into Jean-Jacques, a mysterious diamond dealer with African roots. Beset by the personal woes of divorce and an empty bank account, Big Nick has tracked Donnie down not to bring him to justice, but to join his next big-stakes heist. That includes a meticulously planned and ambitious hit on the ultrasecure World Diamond Center.",

      "For most of the sequel, Jackson speaks with an accent. \u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was the first time in my career I did anything in a different language. But I had a good time. I knew I had the right people behind me.\u201d",
      "As in any high-octane heist movie, he said, the inevitable stunts were a challenge. In one moment, he and Butler were climbing up and down an elevator shaft in heavy neoprene suits. In another, the two were thrown into the ocean.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a regular dude,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cMe and Gerard did not like that day. It was kind of like, \u2018We\u2019re really going to do this.\u2019 And we got in the boat, and it was like, \u2018Man, we\u2019re really far from shore.\u2019\u201d",
      "But, he added, \u201cyou got to pay the cost to be the boss. And I didn\u2019t do movies to do the stuff I do every day.\u201d",
      "Paying the cost has also meant making his own way in the entertainment industry apart from his iconic father, rapper, producer and actor Ice Cube. Jackson said it was difficult at first.",

      "\u201cIn the beginning, there\u2019s always talks of stepping out of a shadow, and I had to really learn early, and that really takes a lot of inner conversations to realize that there is no shadow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something that people from the outside looking in tell you.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat you are doing is building on your family\u2019s name, and there\u2019s a sense of pride that you have to have with doing that,\u201d added Jackson, whose subsequent credits include \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters,\u201d \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d the \u201cStar Wars\u201d miniseries \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d and \u201cCocaine Bear,\u201d among others.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.\u2019s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\u201cShe enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\u201d",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",

    "story": [
      "David Lynch, the surrealist artist who plumbed the darkness lurking underneath American normalcy in the landmark television series \"Twin Peaks\" and the dreamlike films \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Mulholland Drive,\" has died.",
      "He was 78.",
      "Lynch's family confirmed his death in a post on his official Facebook page. They did not specify a cause of death. He revealed last year that he had been diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung condition that causes shortness of breath.",
      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" the post said. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a big hole in the world now that he\u2019s no longer with us,\" Lynch's family added. \"But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It\u2019s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than a half century, Lynch established himself as one of the most stylistically distinctive and thematically daring voices in American entertainment, introducing audiences to images and ideas typically associated with avant-garde art.",
      "He was revered by cinephiles across generations, producing mysterious work that was feverishly analyzed and debated. He fearlessly broke narrative conventions in hallucinatory experimental films like \"Lost Highway\" and \"Inland Empire.\"",
      "Lynch's key preoccupation was the strangeness beneath the surface of America's white-picket-fence ideal, though he also dabbled in science fiction (1984's \"Dune\") and made one G-rated road movie (1999's \"The Straight Story\").",
      "\"Twin Peaks\" (1990-91) was a revolutionary series and an uncanny blend of genres: serialized murder mystery, metaphysical horror story, deadpan comedy, and prime-time soap opera. It was unlike anything on television before or since.",
      "\"Blue Velvet\" (1986), a noir that plays out like a night terror, cemented Lynch as one of the essential American filmmakers of his era, becoming a timeless classic with its unsettling exploration of corruption and abuse.",
      "\"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), originally conceived as a television series, attracted a cult following and quickly emerged one of the first midnight movies of the 21st century. When the British magazine Sight and Sound asked critics in 2022 to name the greatest films of all time, \"Mulholland Drive\" came in eighth.",
      "In recent years, Lynch was less of a visible presence on screens. \"Inland Empire,\" his enigmatic final feature, debuted in theaters nearly 20 years ago. He returned to the world of \"Twin Peaks\" in 2017 with an 18-part limited series on Showtime that cast a spell over admirers and new fans alike.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born on Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. In his early years, he dreamed of becoming a painter and, following high school, he enrolled at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",
      "He later studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he created his first film: a 60-second animation titled \"Six Men Getting Sick.\"",
      "In the early 1970s, when Hollywood was starting to embrace the energy and chaos of the counterculture, Lynch enrolled at what is now known as the American Film Institute Conservatory in Los Angeles.",
      "It's there that Lynch started working on his first feature-length project: \"Eraserhead,\" a startling black-and-white odyssey about an unsettled man (played by Jack Nance) who is forced to take care of a deformed child in an alienating industrial cityscape.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" landed in theaters in March 1977 and divided audiences: some viewers and critics found it repulsive, while others were entranced. It is now regarded as a seminal independent film.",
      "Lynch's next project was made for a major studio, Paramount Pictures, but was no less unusual. \"The Elephant Man\" was loosely based on the life of Joseph Merrick, a physically deformed British artist who was exhibited at London \"freak shows\" under the stage name that gives Lynch's movie its title.",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" was a critical favorite and a modest commercial success, providing an early example of Lynch's preternatural talent for making an iconoclastic art-house sensibility intriguing to mainstream American audiences.",
      "The success of \"The Elephant Man\" led to Lynch's hiring on \"Dune,\" an ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi opus, starring regular Lynch collaborator Kyle MacLachlan in the role of Paul Atreides. \"Dune\" was a box office and critical misfire that Lynch all but disowned.",
      "MacLachlan praised Lynch on Instagram on Thursday as \"an enigmatic and intuitive man with a creative ocean bursting forth inside of him.\"",
      "\"He was in touch with something the rest of us wish we could get to,\u201d MacLachlan wrote.",
      "\"Blue Velvet,\" Lynch's next project, follows a naive college student (played by MacLachlan) who uncovers a local conspiracy after finding a severed human ear in a deserted field. The movie, named after a popular 1950s song, evoked and distorted the midcentury suburban fantasy.",
      "It was released at the height of the Reagan era and provoked intense critical debate. Roger Ebert famously panned it, though other critics hailed it as a brave and unsparing look at the underbelly of small-town ordinariness. It is now arguably Lynch's best-known feature.",
      "Lynch directed Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern in the high-voltage lovers-on-the-run drama \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) the same year \"Twin Peaks\" debuted on ABC. The eccentric series was an almost immediate cultural phenomenon as viewers tuned in to figure out who killed high school student Laura Palmer.",
      "The first season of \"Twin Peaks\" inspired future television auteurs such as David Chase, who credited the show's mystifying tone as a key influence on HBO's \"The Sopranos.\" The second season of \"Peaks\" was more of a mixed bag, and ABC canceled the series after 48 episodes.",
      "Lynch twice revisited the bizarre universe of \"Twin Peaks,\" first in an unnerving and tragic prequel film (\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me,\" released in 1992) and again in the 2017 limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return,\" which aired on Showtime over five months in 2017.",
      "Lynch continued to defy convention in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He surprised nearly everyone when he made \u201cThe Straight Story,\u201d a gentle, family-friendly road trip drama released by Disney in 1999. (It is currently the only Lynch movie parents and kids can stream on Disney+.)",
      "\"Lost Highway,\" a bleak neo-noir released in 1997, marked an artistic turning point for Lynch as he pushed deeper into fractured, impressionistic narratives that left key plot points unexplained and challenged viewers to interpret events for themselves.",
      "\"Mulholland Drive,\" which debuted four years later, revolves around an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) who chases after stardom in L.A. but soon finds her dreams curdling into a nightmare. \"Inland Empire\" covered similar thematic territory with an even more elusive and challenging style.",
      "(\"Mulholland Drive\" was distributed by Universal Pictures, a unit of NBC News' parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Lynch, who occasionally played small or uncredited roles in his own movies, showed up for an amusing cameo as Hollywood giant John Ford in Steven Spielberg's \"The Fabelmans\" (2022). It was his final on-screen appearance in a major production.",
      "Lynch never won an Academy Award, though he was nominated for directing \"The Elephant Man,\" \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Mulholland Drive.\" He was\u00a0presented an honorary Oscar\u00a0in 2019 for lifetime achievement.",
      "\"Wild at Heart\" won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Lynch earned Cannes' best director prize for \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, sharing the award with Joel and Ethan Coen for \"The Man Who Wasn't There.\"",
      "Lynch's activities outside filmmaking were suitably eclectic.",
      "He recorded experimental music, painted, wrote three books, directed commercials and advocated for the practice of Transcendental Meditation, or TM. He founded the David Lynch Foundation, a charitable organization that aims to teach students about the benefits of meditation.",
      "He also uploaded short videos to social media in which he described weather conditions in Los Angeles in earnest, plainspoken language.",
      "He was married four times, to Peggy Lenz, Mary Fisk, Mary Sweeney and Emily Stofle. He had four children, including the filmmaker Jennifer Chambers Lynch."

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden's administration said it will be up to President-elect Donald Trump to implement the ban on TikTok, which is set to take effect in two days after the Supreme Court upheld the law Friday.",
      "\"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.",
      "The law required the China-based company ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok, in order for the popular app to continue operating in the United States. Without such action, it would be banned beginning on Sunday. The measure passed in Congress with bipartisan support, with lawmakers citing national security concerns over the Chinese ownership.",
      "NBC News previously reported that the Biden administration was weighing against enforcing the law and had no plans to levy billions of dollars in fines against tech companies that continued to allow access to TikTok.",
      "The ban will take effect just one day before Trump is set to be inaugurated as president. Trump has said he is against the ban, even though he once supported it.",
      "\"The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\" Trump said in a TruthSocial post.",
      "Without enforcement of the ban beginning on Sunday, it's not entirely clear what TikTok's availability for users will as the law goes into effect. NBC News previously reported that TikTok was considering \"going dark\" as a last resort. But TikTok has yet to issue an official statement on how it will proceed given the Biden administration's most recent comments.",
      "Despite the bipartisan support for the legislation to remove TikTok from its Chinese ownership, it has become politically tricky; politicians faced pressure from the app's users in the United States. Many users earn income from the content they produce on TikTok or use the app to promote their businesses. Others simply value TikTok as a primary source of entertainment.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump unsuccessfully tried to ban the app. But during his campaign for president, after he joined TikTok and amassed over 14 million followers on the app, he vowed to \"save TikTok.\""

      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to appoint his lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, to the Senate seat recently vacated by Vice President-elect JD Vance, two sources with knowledge of the decision told NBC News.",
      "The sources, who were granted anonymity to share details of private discussions, said the announcement is scheduled to come at a 1 p.m. Friday news conference that DeWine has called at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.",
      "A spokesperson for DeWine declined to comment about the agenda for the news conference. A Husted spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Husted, who would serve at least through a 2026 special election to fill the remaining two years of Vance\u2019s term, had recently emerged as a leading contender. DeWine had said appointing someone who could win a competitive Republican primary next year was among his chief considerations.",
      "The decision comes on the heels of Vance\u2019s resignation and follows a meeting that DeWine and Husted had last month with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "Husted\u2019s interest in succeeding DeWine as governor in 2026, and the possibility of Husted being endorsed by Trump, was a topic of conversation, two sources briefed on the meeting told NBC News. But Trump made no commitments to Husted on that race or on the Senate vacancy, these sources said.",
      "The imminent Husted appointment follows a late push from biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a close Trump ally who lives in the Columbus area.",
      "Ramaswamy last fall took himself out of the running for the post after agreeing to lead the new Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. But he had signaled a change of heart recently and met with DeWine about the appointment.",
      "Others who were in the mix to succeed Vance included former state GOP chair Jane Timken, state Treasurer Robert Sprague, Rep. Mike Carey and former state Rep. Jay Edwards.",
      "Signal Ohio first reported that DeWine had settled on Husted.",
      "Trump is a political force in Ohio, where he has won three times by comfortable margins. He and DeWine were on opposite sides of last year\u2019s GOP primary for the state\u2019s other Senate seat \u2014 a race in which DeWine backed a state lawmaker loathed by much of Trump world over Trump-endorsed businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "Moreno easily won the primary and went on to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has not ruled out running in next year\u2019s special election for Vance\u2019s old seat.",
      "DeWine and Husted have been allies since they ran together in 2018. Husted had plans to seek the governorship that year, as well, but he agreed to join DeWine\u2019s ticket as lieutenant governor.",
      "Despite their close relationship, Husted, 57, has tried to navigate his own path in the party. He endorsed Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid hours before last year\u2019s Iowa caucuses and has been close with Ramaswamy.",
      "Ramaswamy\u2019s potential interest in the 2026 race for governor, combined with Trump\u2019s reluctance to issue an early endorsement of Husted, likely factored into Husted\u2019s decision on whether to accept DeWine\u2019s Senate appointment. Other prominent Republicans, including Sprague and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, also have been preparing campaigns for governor, threatening to further crowd the field."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:33:04 GMT",
    "summary": "As the number of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change increases, there is a growing workforce of laborers, many of them without legal status.",
    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 While firefighters battled blazes in the Los Angeles area this week, Alejandro, a 55-year-old from Mexico, was one of several day laborers leading cleanups near scorched neighborhoods in Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "Donning a yellow safety vest, a mask and glasses, he helped pick up branches and fallen trees and direct traffic while others worked.",
      "\u201cThe country would fall into crisis\u201d without workers like him, said Alejandro, who spoke in Spanish and requested his last name not be used because he is in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one (home),\u201d added Alejandro. \u201cThere were thousands.\u201d",
      "When President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next week, he has said he plans to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Immigrant advocates say that could impact America\u2019s ability to quickly rebuild after major damage from floods, hurricanes, fires and other disasters.",
      "As the number of extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change increases, there is a growing workforce of laborers, many of them without legal status. Some crisscross the country following extreme weather events, helping to put back together entire communities. Many are highly skilled electricians, plumbers and masons. Others do manual labor, like cutting up and hauling away fallen trees and branches.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that the people who rebuild those areas \u2014 from Palisades to Malibu to Altadena \u2014 it\u2019s immigrant construction crews,\u201d said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are the second responders.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the U.S. was hit with 28 climate disasters that each exceeded $1 billion in damages, the most ever, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While it is too early to know the toll of L.A.\u2019s wildfires, an early estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic loss at $250 billion to $275 billion.",
      "Trump has called climate change \u201ca hoax\u201d and during his campaign accused immigrants of taking \u201cBlack jobs\u201d and \u201cHispanic jobs.\u201d Data show that immigrant labor contributes to economic growth and provides promotional opportunities for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s transition team, told The Associated Press in a statement that Trump \u201cwill enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities\u201d to deport \u201cillegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers... while simultaneously lowering costs for families and strengthening our workforce.\u201d",
      "The disaster restoration industry boomed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which transformed the Gulf Coast into one of the largest construction sites in the world. Many mom-and-pop construction businesses got bigger and consolidated. Some were eventually bought by private equity companies that saw a highly profitable industry with money coming in from insurance companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "Mario Mendoza has worked in disaster restoration since Katrina. Within days after the storm, Mendoza was cleaning up mud-caked homes and businesses, removing debris, demolishing walls and ripping up floors, some with asbestos.",
      "Mendoza, a 54-year-old worker from Honduras in the country without legal status, remembered seeing dead bodies in homes he was hired to clean. Some bosses refused to pay him. In the years since Katrina, he has helped Louisiana communities rebuild after tornadoes and hurricanes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been the line of support for cities after disasters,\u201d he said, speaking in Spanish.",
      "After disasters, workers are hired by residents, contractors or subcontractors to tear down moldy walls damaged by flooding, or tarp and repair roofs and windows blown off by powerful winds. They remove debris and felled trees from people\u2019s homes, clogged streets and roadways. Then they rebuild. Those without legal status are vulnerable to exploitation and wage theft. They sleep in pickup trucks or tents, sometimes on parking lot floors or the destroyed houses they\u2019re reassembling. They are roofers, carpenters, tile installers and laborers.",
      "Day laborers hired to clean up homes often don\u2019t have protective equipment or safety training, exposing them to \u201csevere hazardous materials\u201d and dangerous environments, said Jessica Martinez, executive director for the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, a network of labor organizations that has trained workers in post-hurricane recovery. She added that Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric also discourages workers from asking for basic resources because they fear being targeted and deported.",
      "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, some 10.8 million people were working in the construction industry in 2020. The Center for American Progress estimates that nearly 1.6 million immigrants working in 2021 in construction \u2014 a workforce in which Latinos are overrepresented \u2014 were in the country illegally. The numbers are higher in states like Texas and California.",
      "In addition to workers already in the U.S., every year tens of thousands of people legally acquire H-2B visas, which allow them to temporarily enter the country to do non-agricultural work. Construction is one of the industries with a high prevalence of H-2B workers.",
      "Stan Marek, CEO of the construction company Marek Brothers, said mass deportations would significantly hinder efforts to clean up and rebuild after disasters, and contractors would struggle to complete existing and future projects.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the people, you can\u2019t fix it,\u201d said Marek, a Republican. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t fixed everything from (Hurricane) Harvey, which was years ago. Some people\u2019s ceilings are still sagging, falling in.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has a housing shortage, raising questions about how the Trump administration will address that with fewer construction workers. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Vice President-elect JD Vance said construction workers without legal status could be replaced by the millions of \u201cprime age\u201d men and women who have dropped out of the labor force. He also said they could be convinced to join the trade by paying them higher wages.",
      "Florida provides a glimpse of the possible effect of any upcoming large deportations. In the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia that struck the Big Bend region in August 2023, some workers without legal status were too fearful to finish recovery jobs they had started because of a Florida immigration law that had taken effect in July. One of the strictest in the nation, it requires businesses employing 25 or more people to verify their workers\u2019 legal status, among other things.",
      "\u201cA lot of the workers that I know didn\u2019t want to risk staying there,\u201d said Saket Soni, executive director of the nonprofit Resilience Force, which advocates for the growing group of disaster restoration laborers. \u201cThey wanted to finish the work, but they couldn\u2019t risk deportation. So they put their tools down and left.\u201d",
      "Sergio Ch\u00e1vez, sociology professor at Rice University who is writing a book about the disaster recovery industry, sees a few alternatives for filling a potential construction labor shortage: either Trump will have to expand the H-2B worker program, or hire Americans who will do the job for higher pay.",
      "But Marek isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cEverybody says pay them more. We\u2019ve tried paying them more,\u201d he said. \u201cOur starting wages are higher than they\u2019ve ever been. And they would rather go work at Buc-ee\u2019s,\u201d referring to the travel store chain."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:27:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender member of Congress, said she remains focused on her job and refuses to give Republicans what they want, which she said is for her to take the \u201cbait\u201d over a policy that bars her from women\u2019s restrooms in the House.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender member of Congress, said she remains focused on her job and refuses to give Republicans what they want, which she said is for her to take the \u201cbait\u201d over a policy that bars her from women\u2019s restrooms in the House.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., informally enacted the policy in November and renewed it earlier this month when Congress began its new session. The policy was initially proposed in November by Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who said it was a direct response to the election of McBride.",
      "McBride said in a statement at the time that she would respect the policy and wouldn\u2019t let it distract her from what she was there to do: serve her constituents. Some trans people criticized McBride\u2019s response, arguing that she should have resisted or protested more, particularly as the incoming administration and Republicans in Congress have made targeting trans people a priority. Some people said she wasn\u2019t standing up for herself, and, as a result, she wasn\u2019t standing up for trans people.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, McBride said she understands why some people feel that way, but that the bathroom policy wasn\u2019t really about banning people from restrooms in the Capitol Complex.",
      "\u201cThe point of this bathroom ban was to bait me into a fight, was to diminish my capacity to be an effective member of Congress by turning me into a caricature,\u201d she said. \u201cI refuse to give them that opportunity or that response that they seek. That is what they want. There is power in not giving people what they want.\u201d",
      "She said that throughout history, people who secure \u201cfirsts\u201d \u2014 like her becoming the first openly trans member of Congress \u2014 have been required to \u201cpick their battles\u201d and fight smarter, not always harder. In this case, she believes civil disobedience doesn\u2019t mean disobeying the policy and \u201cclaiming a toilet seat.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe civil disobedience that is happening here is claiming a congressional seat in an institution that some people do not want me in simply because of who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cThe disobedience is claiming that seat, and the civil part is taking the indignities that come with it with my chin up.\u201d",
      "McBride said that her \u201cturning the other cheek\u201d might not be comforting in the moment, especially for trans people who fear the policies of the incoming Trump administration and want to see McBride fight back.",
      "However, she said, \u201cit does not do the trans community any good for me to begin my career showing Republicans that they can bait me into getting the response that they want from me.\u201d",
      "Despite the policy and Republicans\u2019 focus on restricting trans rights, McBride said her colleagues, regardless of party, have been warm and welcoming and have said hello to her in the hallways. When asked whether she\u2019s had any conversations or interactions with Mace, McBride replied with a grin: \u201cWho?\u201d",
      "She said it\u2019s notable that Mace\u2019s resolution wasn\u2019t included in the formal House rules package, and that her focus going forward is to do her job and work with \u201canyone who\u2019s willing to be serious \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 to do that work and to deliver for my constituents and their constituents alike.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn doing that, I hope to continue to build relationships with those serious members of Congress so that we can deliver on all of the issues, and hopefully, in delivering on those issues, people can begin to see that members of the LGBTQ community that they might not have previously known are indeed real people, and they are real people who are damn good legislators, and they are real people who deserve to be able to fully and equally participate in public life themselves,\u201d McBride said.",
      "In that vein, during her first week in Congress, McBride became the first freshman Democrat to introduce a bill. The bipartisan Ending Scam Credit Repair Act, which she introduced with Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., is meant to protect consumers from deceptive credit repair organizations that charge high fees and falsely promise to help people with their credit scores.",
      "\u201cWe are removing loopholes in federal law that have allowed people to be taken advantage of by these entities that are really violating the spirit of federal law right now but, because of those loopholes, are able to prey on hardworking people with empty and costly promises,\u201d McBride said.",
      "Though her days are packed, McBride, a self-professed history and politics nerd since childhood, said that every day she enters the Capitol, she is \u201cin awe.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in a chamber where they passed the 13th Amendment and the 14th Amendment, where women got the right to vote, where Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid were created, where the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were passed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel the history in the air and the responsibility and gravity of the job that is on your shoulders, and I think when you no longer feel that, if you ever no longer feel that, it\u2019s time to look for a different line of work.\u201d",
      "McBride said she returns to Delaware as much as she can and typically only stays overnight in Washington, D.C., when there\u2019s a late vote. As a result of her frequent back-and-forth travel, she has developed a late-night dinner habit that has garnered quite a bit of attention.",
      "In a recent interview with The Washington Post, McBride revealed that this meal, ordered at a Taco Bell and KFC in Wilmington, Delaware, consists of cheese nachos, five tacos, eight chicken tenders and three drumsticks.",
      "When asked about the order and whether she goes to one fast-food chain right after the other, McBride responded: \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it; it\u2019s a Taco Bell-KFC in one.\u201d She added: \u201cKFC is not my favorite fried chicken. Taco Bell is not even Tex-Mex \u2014 it\u2019s its own thing. But you give me a place where I can get both in one drive-thru \u2014 and it\u2019s often open until midnight, and I work pretty late \u2014 I\u2019m going to have to take advantage of it.\u201d",
      "However, after getting \u201ca lot of feedback\u201d about her order from those concerned for her health, McBride made an important clarification to NBC News and her social media followers: \u201cI don\u2019t eat that meal every night.\u201d"

Each student chooses to enter one of four quadrants: Healers, Scribes, Infantry or Riders, the quadrant with the highest death rate. Near Basgiath are the dragon hatching grounds known as the Vale. Basgiath is where the original dragon riders, known as the First Six, wove the wards of Navarre, which protect the borders.",
      "Tyrrendor: One of the provinces that make up Navarre. Tyrrendor's leaders tried and failed to secede from Navarre in the Tyrrish Rebellion before the events of the books.

Xaden and Violet have had a tumultuous relationship so far, with plenty of secrets.

However, the power faded with age. Currently, she can change the color of her scales, but her development from a child into an adolescent was altered. By the end of \"Iron Flame,\" her personality is akin to that of a teenager: moody, keen on not being left out and searching for independence.",

      "One night, she overhears Xaden holding a secret meeting with all the rebellion children. Basgiath has a rule that no more than three marked ones can meet at once, so this meeting is a capital offense. Violet is caught by Xaden, but she promises to keep the meeting a secret.",

      "Violet and Dain kiss after Threshing, although Violet doesn't think it feels right. Afterwards, the pair maintain a friendship.",
      "Bonding with Tairn immediately links her to Xaden, as Tairn is mated to Xaden's dragon, Sgaeyl, giving them the power to mind speak to each other.",
      "Despite being mortal enemies, Xaden ends up training Violet. A rider will die if their dragon dies, and occasionally, a dragon can't recover after their rider's death. Tairn and Sgaeyl's mating bond also means they cannot be apart from each other for long, and if one dies, so does the other. Because of their mated dragons, Xaden now needs to keep Violet alive to keep himself alive.",

      "What happens at the end of 'Fourth Wing'?",
      "In the books climactic ending, Dain betrays Violet.",
      "Throughout the book, Dain regularly touches her face in times of worry. It's revealed that secretly, he'd been using his signet to read her thoughts, and he saw the secret, illegal meeting Xaden held. Dain reported it.",
      "When the War Games, an end of year test of a squad's abilities, comes around, Dain's dad, Colonel Aetos, assigns Xaden and Violet's squad to go to Aethebyne,\u00a0located beyond the wards' safety.",
      "When they get there, Violet learns that Xaden has been secretly assisting gryphon riders from Poromiel, supplying them with weapons. It turns out, the reason they've been attacking Navarrian outposts is because they are under attack from venin, creatures Violet previously believed were only myth, and needed supplies.",

      "What happens in 'Iron Flame'?",
      "\"Iron Flame\" begins where the first book ended, but Violet's inner turmoil is at an all-time high as she comes to terms with fables being real, mourns the loss of Liam, battles conflicting emotions regarding Brennan being alive and misses Xaden, despite not wanting to.",

With Xaden becoming the revolution's leader, he needs to keep some secrets, but Violet requests full disclosure if he wants to be together. They remain at an impasse for a while.",
      "Meanwhile, the other marked ones continue to smuggle weapons out of Basgiath to gryphon fliers. Violet, now a second-year, embarks on a research journey in the Archives, with the help of Jesinia, to figure out how Basgiath wards work so she can set up wards around Aretia.",
      "New characters are introduced, including first years Aaric and Sloane, who Violet promised to protect, as well as new villains, like Major Varrish, who is known for his harsh torture techniques and harbors a hatred for Violet.",
      "As Violet continues to search for accounts from the First Six on how the wards were created, Jack Barlowe returns to Basgiath. It turns out, Violet didn't kill him in the first book, and he's been going through an extensive mending process.",
      "With the help of her friends, Violet figures out that the journals of the First Six are most likely in King Tauri's private vault, but they'll need someone from his bloodline to get in, so they rope Aaric into their plan.",

      "Violet and Xaden eventually break into the Archives for the journals and take two. However, Nolan, a healer who Violet has always trusted, deceives and drugs her. Varrish arrives, taking one of the journals with him.",
      "Violet is subjected to torture from Varrish, but she holds strong. In a final act to break her, Varrish calls in Dain and commands him read Violet's memories, which he does. After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",
      "Xaden uses the chaos of Basgiath to his advantage, addressing all the cadets and telling them the truth of what's happening beyond the wards. He gives them the option to stay at Basgiath and defend Navarre, or, come with him to fight for the whole Continent. Nearly half the quadrant decides to join.",
      "The group continues holding classes for the riders at Aretia as Violet tries to translate the journals and get the wards up and running. Soon, she thinks she's discovered the solution: blood magic.",
      "After her first attempt fails, Violet goes in search of a luminary. She visits Poromiel's leader, Viscount Tecarus, and learns that Xaden was offered a luminary in exchange for herself, a deal he refused.  After having to fight off another venin and agreeing to train gryphon fliers in Aretia, Xaden and Violet secure the luminary.",
      "Back at Aretia, Violet, Xaden and his ex-fianc\u00e9e, a gryphon flier named Cat, spar over their twisted romantic pasts. Xaden reveals he is technically heir to Tyrrendor, reassuring Violet that he and Cat were only ever together for a political alliances.",
      "But just as the pair starts to piece their relationship back together, it crumbles once more when Violet realizes that Xaden has a secret second signet, since Sgaeyl bonded Xaden and his grandfather before him.",
      "Violet demands he tell her what it is. He reveals he's inntinnsic, meaning he can read minds. Manifesting as an inntinnsic typically results in death in Navarre.",
      "How does 'Iron Flame' end?",
      "General Melgren, General Lilith Sorrengail and some other members of leadership request a meeting with Violet, Xaden and Mira.",
      "Melgren tells them that he's seen an upcoming battle, claiming the venin will attack Samara and win. He asks them to help in the battle, but Brennan reveals himself, telling them no.",

      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber. It turns out, Jack survived Violet dropping a mountain on him because he turned venin. Jack kills his own dragon, which cracks the wardstone in half, knocking down the college's wards.",

      "They begin to assemble their forces, as Brennan arrives with more riders and fliers. Brennan tries to mend the wardstone as the battle above begins.",
      "One of the venin reveals that their goal is to take Violet alive. Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\"",
      "What will happen in 'Onyx Storm'?",
      "It's unclear where \"Onyx Storm\" will pick up after the events of \"Iron Flame.\"",
      "Yarros teased what the book will hold in an interview with Elle, revealing that \"fans can expect to see Violet with one singular motivation, which is to save Xaden.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to follow the implications of what\u2019s been revealed in\u00a0'Iron Flame,' and you\u2019re going to see Andarna very curious about where she comes from,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s the biggest thing I can tease before a publisher jumps out and tackles me to the floor.\"",
      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",
      "They need an army. They need power. They need\u00a0magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find\u2014the truth.",
      "But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath."

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker had the kind of career stat line that would be sad if it wasn\u2019t so funny. But funny is what would ultimately cement his legacy.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90, was a career .200 hitter across six seasons in Major League Baseball. He ultimately embraced his own ineptitude, often mocking himself for his lack of ability on the diamond.",
      "Uecker took his schtick and ran with it, all the way to Hollywood. Nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball,\u201d he was a frequent, gut-busting guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d for years after he retired. He appeared in several well-known Miller Lite commercials, in which he poked fun at himself when he declared, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d after an usher at a game informs him that he\u2019s in the wrong seats. He parlayed those efforts into a starring role on the small screen, playing George Owens on the ABC sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere,\u201d which ran for six seasons from 1985 until 1990.",
      "But all of that may have just been a prologue for what seems like a casting job that was as natural as a tailor-made 4-6-3 double play. In the hit 1989 movie \u201cMajor League,\u201d Uecker played Cleveland play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle, whose wit would often serve as cover for how awful the team was, only for him to get caught up in the fervor when the team begins winning.",
      "(There's profanity in the clip below.)",
      "\u201cJuuuust a bit outside,\u201d he casually says early in the movie, stretching out the word \u201cjust\u201d when Charlie Sheen\u2019s Rick \u201cWild Thing\u201d Vaughn throws a pitch more than a few feet off home plate during the team\u2019s first game.

      "\u201cUecker\u2019s irreverence enlivened a character \u2014 the play-by-play announcer \u2014 that had long been taken for granted in baseball films,\u201d Noah Gittell wrote in the 2024 book \u201cBaseball: The Movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, their role was to set the scene for the film\u2019s climactic game with flowery prose or ... act as foil to the players or manager. (Director and writer David S.) Ward and Uecker collaborated on a true innovation of the genre by turning this archetype into a comic Greek chorus punctuating the clownish action on the field with perfectly delivered zingers. It was a breath of fresh air for the baseball film, which had perhaps become overly solemn in the \u201880s with \u2018The Natural,\u2019 \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018Eight Men Out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Uecker, who spent 54 seasons as the radio play-by-play man for the Milwaukee Brewers, reprised the role in \u201cMajor League II.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just a perfect fit as Harry Doyle, though. He also provided a template for those who came after him.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a play-by-play announcer in the game who hasn\u2019t once paid homage to the film by impersonating Uecker\u2019s delivery of that line,\u201d Gittell added about how Uecker said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t only announcers, either. If you ever played Wiffle ball in your backyard, turned on a baseball game or, heck, even tried archery and missed a target by 10 feet, you\u2019ve probably said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",
      "Uecker had an uncanny talent for putting a smile on people\u2019s faces, whether in a studio audience or in a movie theater.",
      "\u201cThe most hilarious guy I\u2019ve ever met, off-camera and on,\u201d \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d co-star Rob Stone once said about Uecker.",
      "Baseball and movies are known for their characters \u2014 movies for the characters in them, baseball for characters who add personality to the game.

      "\"I feel like I am in prison,\u201d she added, referring to the New York facility where she\u2019s been living.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in this place where the people are in their 90s and their 80s and their 70s. ... I have breakfast, lunch and dinner right here on the bed. I watch TV, I listen to radio, I look out the window, I talk on the phone.\"",
      "At another point in the interview, Charlamagne tha God, a friend of Williams\u2019 and one of the show\u2019s hosts, reiterated her guardian's claims, telling her, \u201cThey said you\u2019re cognitively impaired and you\u2019re incapacitated.\u201d",
      "Williams responded, \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201d The rest of the show\u2019s hosts agreed she didn\u2019t.",
      "Finnie, too, spoke to her aunt\u2019s temperament. \u201cThis does not match an incapacitated person,\u201d she said. \u201cMy aunt has always been a unique personality. \u2026 That is who she is.\u201d",
      "Morrissey did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appeared to have cognitive difficulty when speaking to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggested that these issues were associated with her alcohol use.",
      "Williams currently has a court-appointed legal guardian, Morrissey, who oversees her money and health to avoid the potential for her to be exploited due to her cognitive issues, People reported.",
      "Williams\u2019 sister, Wanda Finnie, also told People in a story published in February 2024, that the star was in a wellness facility that specialized in treating cognitive issues.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s being treated for some of her mental deficiencies, some of the cognitive issues,\u201d Finnie, said in the documentary. \u201cThey\u2019re getting to the root of the problem in terms of what causes maybe some of the drinking and other irrational decisions.\u201d",

      "Primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, impacts speech, reading, writing and the ability to understand what others are saying to you. It\u2019s a subtype of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which affects communication, including speech, writing and the ability to understand language.",
      "FTD is caused by shrinking in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control personality, behavior and language. Depending on which parts of the brain are affected, someone might experience personality changes, such as behaving erratically, inappropriately, or becoming distant, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "FTD is sometimes misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it typically occurs at a younger age, between 40 and 65, than other types of dementia.",
      "\u201cMost people, when they think of the word dementia, they think problems with memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but FTD doesn\u2019t really show up as problems with memory. ... It affects how people behave, how they interact with others and how they speak,\u201d Dr. Sami Barmada, director of Michigan Brain Bank and associate professor of neurology at University of Michigan Medicine, previously told TODAY.com about Bruce Willis, who was diagnosed with the same conditions.",

At the time, a rep for her show told TODAY.com in a statement that she\u2019d had Graves\u2019 disease for \u201cmany years.\u201d",

This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",
      "Williams returned to her show, but she had to take time off in 2019 and again in 2020 to cope with her illness.",
      "\u201cIf hyperthyroidism is untreated, it can be life-threatening,\u201d Adimoolam says. While there are treatments, such as medication, surgery and therapy, Graves\u2019 disease looks different for every person, she adds. Even with treatment, it might remain debilitating for some.",

      "Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she was talking to the camera and then started to shake and struggle to speak before falling on the ground. The show cut to a commercial, and when it returned, she told viewers, \u201cThat was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I passed out.\u201d",
      "The next day, she explained that prior to fainting, she felt \u201chot and a little dizzy.\u201d She said the paramedics later told her she was low on electrolytes.",

      "Wendy Williams has struggled with alcohol and cocaine use",
      "In 2013, Williams told NPR she used to be a \u201creal fiend\u201d when it came to drugs. \u201cI was addicted to cocaine,\u201d she said. \u201cCrack cocaine \u2014 cooking it, getting it up in the Bronx. ... Thank God I never got stopped by the cops to shame my family and myself and lose my job.\u201d",

      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams\u2019 case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn\u2019t drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s not curable and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "Wendy Williams has been living with lymphedema, a chronic condition that can be highly uncomfortable, for several years.",

      "\u201cI was really excited initially, but the more I thought about it the more nervous I got. It kind of turned into me being terrified about the whole process just because I realized, at that moment, that not only my story, but my family story, would be told to the world,\u201d Anthony Robles explains. \u201cAnd that included the painful moments, the things that we weren\u2019t comfortable sharing.\u201d",
      "After he and his mother agreed to move forward with the project, they decided that their ultimate goal was to motivate people and \u201cbe as true as possible with our entire story,\u201d he says.",

At one point, Anthony and Rick get into a physical altercation after the wrestler discovers that Rick lost his job and is trying to get back with his mom.",
      "\u201cThere are moments where I was actually tearing up, just reading it, where I was feeling the anger all over again, the pain all over again,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut talking to my mom about it, and talking to my siblings, because they went through the same experiences with us, we were all on the same page. We realized that we had to share that part of our story.\u201d",
      "In a Jan. 14 Q&A for the film in New York, attended by TODAY.com, Judy Robles said that in order to tell their story, she had to share \u201cthe things that I was feeling, the things that I was dealing with, and the things that I was doing wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo being vulnerable was very, very hard, but I think that when this team came alongside and they made us feel safe,\u201d she said.",
      "How Anthony Robles and J.Lo helped to ensure 'Unstoppable' was authentic",
      "Anthony Robles was included in the script process to make sure his story was authentic. As with any biopic, there were some dramatizations for the film, including dialogue.",
      "However, Anthony Robles says \u201cfor the most part, they did a great job of sticking with the authentic story and what happened.\u201d There were little tidbits here and there, he says, they changed for timing purposes, \u201cwhere they had to bunch certain things together.\u201d",
      "Among his \u201cbiggest concerns\u201d for the film was how his mom was going to be portrayed, \u201cbecause she is the one that I look up to as my hero. The one that got me through those tough times, that helped me to find that little ounce of hope to keep going.\u201d He tells TODAY.com his goal was to show people where her strength came from.",
      "One fun fact about the film is that Judy Robles actually gave Lopez her real clothes to wear in the film. Among the items that Lopez wears that were Judy Robles\u2019 include \u201cwrestler mom\u201d shirts, hoodies and a pink beanie.",
      "Sharing how \u201cJennifer was just so committed to portray my mom in this authentic light, down to the clothes,\u201d Anthony Robles even mistook Lopez for his mom.",
      "\u201cOne day I was on set and we\u2019re getting ready to start filming. I see someone walk by, and I thought it was my mom because I saw the beanie and I recognized the shirt,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe was walking away from me, and it was Jennifer. She turned around, (and I was like), whoa, this is crazy.\u201d",

      "Anthony Robles was \u201cextremely impressed\u201d with Jerome\u2019s dedication to the role and training regime. The actor had to learn how to be a wrestler and how to walk and run on crutches.",
      "\u201cIt was very physically demanding for him,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com, adding that his style of wrestling is \u201cvery unique.\u201d",
      "Jerome echoed Anthony Robles\u2019 comments in an interview with Variety, telling the magazine the athlete coached him 14 hours a day.",
      "\u201cRepeating the same moves again and again. He taught me to use my fists and my arms and to stretch and pull with all these different parts of my body,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt was the most physically challenging thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d",
      "It was also challenging for Anthony Robles, who said had to get back on the mat for some scenes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a high school wrestling coach. I\u2019m showing technique, but to get back into the physicality of it, I was training like I was back in my wrestling days,\u201d Anthony Robles tells TODAY.com.",
      "His training included being on the mat for hours a day, cardio that included swimming, spin and more.",
      "Anthony Robles says giving 100 percent during the scenes felt like he was wrestling a full match again.",
      "\u201cI was definitely feeling it. My body was tired, my lungs were given out,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like I was competing all over again.\u201d",
      "Additionally, his former assistant wrestling coach from Arizona State, Brian Stith, was brought in to help choreograph the wrestling matches. \u201cHe knew exactly what made me me on the wrestling mat,\u201d he says.",
      "Anthony Robles' real-life bond with his coaches",
      "Michael Pe\u00f1a co-stars as coach Bobby Williams, Anthony\u2019s high school coach and one of his biggest champions. To this day, he remains in contact with them and tells TODAY.com that they \u201ctext regularly.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby Williams, he\u2019s always been like a father figure to me,\" he says, crediting him for helping him find his abilities. \"Walking into the wrestling room for the first time, he treated me like I was a national champion already.\u201d",
      "He adds that Williams also echoed his mom\u2019s advice to him, saying, \u201cMy mom would always tell me, \u2018Focus on what you\u2019re capable of, focus on what you can do, not what you can\u2019t.\u2019 And in the wrestling room, my coach used to tell me, \u2018We\u2019re going to focus on your strengths and camouflage your weaknesses. We\u2019re going to build a style that works for you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Just like in \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d he would get advice from Williams while wrestling in college. They would later go on to coach together for three years.",
      "Don Cheadle took on the role of coach Shawn Charles, Anthony\u2019s ASU wrestling coach who, at first, appears to question Anthony\u2019s ability. He\u2019s quickly proven wrong when Anthony goes above and beyond during try-outs and training.",
      "As for Charles, Anthony Robles says his coach would always back him up when he was struggling. He credits him for taking him to a \u201cwhole new level.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe forced me outside of my comfort zone on a regular basis,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust challenged me to think at a different level and improve myself.\u201d",
      "He says that having them both at the national tournament his senior year, seeing him win and celebrating together \u201cwas something very special, because I could not have gotten there without either one of them.\u201d",
      "Where is Anthony Robles now?",
      "Anthony Robles would go on to become the first athlete signed by Nike after retiring from a sport. At the end of the film, there is a message from former CEO of Nike, Inc. Phil Knight that reads, \u201cAfter what he accomplished, Anthony Robles will be a Nike athlete for life.\u201d",
      "In 2013, former President Barack Obama appointed him to President\u2019s council on fitness, sports and nutrition, and in 2022 he took over as wrestling coach at Mesa High in Arizona.",
      "Now a motivational speaker and author, Anthony Robles is a husband and father. He and wife, Laura Robles, have been married for three years. They are parents to a 2-year-old boy named Abel.",
      "He also continues to be a wrestling coach, helping other students get motivated and inspired.",
      "\u201cIf I can help even one of them, that\u2019s my way of giving back and saying thank you to the people who helped me to get here today,\u201d he says."

    "story": [
      "As a girl, Aaliyah dreamed of musical stardom \u2014 and used her Barbie dolls to act them out.",
      "\u201cThe dolls would be singing and they\u2019d be performing. Sometimes I\u2019d try to get in on it,\u201d Rashad Haughton, the late singer\u2019s brother and a writer and director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Aaliyah's childhood fantasies turned into reality as she grew up and became one of the most celebrated R&B artists of the \u201890. Sadly, the singer, whose full name was Aaliyah Haughton, passed away at the age of 22 in 2001 following a plane crash.",
      "Nearly 24 years after Aaliyah\u2019s death, the singer is being honored with a Barbie doll in her likeness.",
      "Part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, the doll is being released on the singer\u2019s birthday, Jan. 16. and will be available to purchase on the Mattel Shop for a suggested retail price of $55. (As of Jan. 16 at 9:34 a.m., the doll is sold out).",
      "Haughton worked closely with Mattel to design a doll that would resemble his sister and capture her style. The end result? A striking doll that rocks a miniature replica of the outfit Aaliyah wore in the music video for her hit song \u201cOne in a Million.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was the second album and \u2018One in a Million\u2019 was such a key song in transitioning her sound to maturity, empowerment, confidence at that point in her career,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "Haughton and Mattel worked together to design the doll\u2019s outfit, which consists of a faux leather black top and matching pants with lace-up details, a zippered vest with detached sleeves and cool sunglasses. The Mattel team also enlisted the insight of Aaliyah\u2019s stylist Derek Lee.",
      "Haughton was \u201cblown away\u201d when he saw the final product and thinks his sister would approve of the edgy ensemble since her favorite color was \u201call black.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still tight fitting, it\u2019s still a little bit sexy. But it\u2019s pants so it brings that power and that confidence and expression. It really just checked all the boxes of what my sister represents and also what Barbie represents, which is empowerment and expression,\u201d he explains.",
      "Best known for the musical style she called \u201cstreet but sweet\u201d and hits like \u201cTry Again,\u201d Aaliyah earned a host of awards throughout her career, including three American Music Awards for favorite soul/R&B female artist and two MTV Video Music Awards. She also collaborated with top musicians, including Missy Elliot and Timbaland.",
      "Haughton regularly worked as a creative consultant for the singer. Following an Aaliyah makeup collection with M.A.C. in 2018, the singer\u2019s Barbie doll is the latest brand collaboration Haughton has spearheaded to ensure that his sister\u2019s legacy lives on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like that job that I had with her is still continuing. And obviously it\u2019s emotional at times, but it\u2019s also wonderful because there\u2019s a lot of meaning in that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt brings back memories and it continues on dreams that we had when she was here. In a lot of ways, it makes me feel like things are continuing on as they should, and those dreams are still valuable and they\u2019re still real.\u201d",
      "Haughton calls the collaboration with Mattel \u201ca dream come true\u201d for himself and Aaliyah.",
      "\u201cIt was something that I always wanted because I know it was something that was my sister\u2019s dream,\u201d he says.",
      "With her new doll, Aaliyah joins other legendary musicians who have been part of the Barbie Music Collector Series, including Gloria Estevan, David Bowie, Elvis Presley, Elton John and Stevie Nicks.",
      "\u201cTo have my sister part of that list, it really is a testament to her legacy, and I\u2019m elated to have this doll come out. It\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Haughton says.",
      "When asked how he wants people to remember Aaliyah, Haughton shares a quote his sister once gave during an appearance on MTV.",
      "\u201cWhat she said was, \u2018I want people to remember me as a true entertainer\u2019 because she really, truly loved what she did every single day. As hard as the work was and as challenging it was, I think it\u2019s not work when you love what you do,\u201d he says.",
      "Noting that Aaliyah was always \u201cappreciative\u201d of her success, Haughton recalls how those dreams started in her childhood bedroom while playing with her Barbie dolls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s (about) imagination and taking that imagination and dreaming about what you want to be, then taking those steps from childhood to the future and making it real. My sister did that. Every little girl can do that too. That\u2019s the message that I want people to take from this collaboration.\""

      "\"Y.M.C.A.\" and other Village People hits, including \"Macho Man\" and \"In The Navy,\" were early on embraced as an anthem by the LGTBQ+ community, a point that came up in some of the shocked comments left alongside Willis' announcement.",
      "\"You would think that as a band founded and focused around queer culture, you\u2019d have a little more respect for queer people. Not to mention a backbone, for yourself,\" wrote one angry fan.",
      "Meanwhile, other fans applauded the band for agreeing to perform with unity in mind.",
      "\"Congratulations! A well deserved honor. The music has been claimed by many. So let\u2019s enjoy it together,\" someone wrote.",
      "Last month, Willis defended Trump\u2019s use of \"Y.M.C.A.\" at campaign rallies, saying in a Dec. 2 Facebook statement that the song was never intended to be a \u201cgay anthem.\u201d",
      "\"There\u2019s been a lot of talk, especially of late, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem. As I\u2019ve said numerous times in the past, that is a false assumption based on the fact that my writing partner was gay, and some (not all) of Village People were gay, and that the first Village People album was totally about gay life,\" wrote Willis.",
      "Willis explained that the lyrics he contributed to \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d were informed by his observations at YMCA branches in \"urban areas of San Francisco,\" where young men participated in \"swimming, basketball, track, and cheap food and cheap rooms.\"",
      "\"And when I say, 'hang out with all the boys' that is simply 1970s black slang for black guys hanging-out together for sports, gambling or whatever.  There\u2019s nothing gay about that,\" he wrote, noting that had instructed his wife to \u201cstart suing\u201d news organizations who refer to the song as a \u201cgay anthem.\"",
      "Willis added that \"Y.M.C.A.\" had \"benefited greatly\" from Trump's use at his rallies, noting that the song finally reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard dance/electronic chart and was now generating \"millions\" of dollars in sales.",
      "\"The true anthem is Y.M.C.A.\u2019s appeal to people of all strips (sic) including President Elect Trump,\" he concluded."

      "Cosby tells TODAY.com that she's a \"helicopter mom\" who wants to \"protect my son at all costs,\" so it was a challenging decision to be so public about the conversation.

      "Before the scene aired, Cosby says she was contacted by tabloids threatening to publish that Robert Jr. was in rehab. \"I was like, well, I'm just going to let this air, and then they can all just be quiet,\" she says. \"It really worked.\"",

I was in the moment ... and it shocked me, and it hurt me. It just made me feel like, 'Oh my god. How did I miss the cues?'\"",
      "\"It wasn't planned,\" she continues. \"What came out of him was real, and what came out of me was real. And I think that's why it went across so good, because we weren't doing it for any sole reason. We were doing it because that's our relationship.\""

      "\u201cI had no memory of meeting him the first time, but we had immediate sparks,\u201d Longoria said, later adding, \u201cHe was so charismatic, charming, sweet and funny. I thought, \u2018Who is this guy?!\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to yell from the highest mountaintop about everything that goes on with us because I\u2019m so happy and excited to be with a person as kind as Pepe is,\u201d Longoria added. \u201cHe is probably one of the first men I\u2019ve dated that has been older and established and, basically, a grown-up.\u201d",
      "The couple makes it a priority to \u2018connect\u2019 each day",
      "Throughout various interviews, Longoria has let interviewers in on their home life.",
      "During a 2022 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Longoria said they have dinner together \u201cevery night.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe make it a big priority to connect every day. Plus, we are so busy in our day that at night we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019 And we\u2019re so excited about what we did and what we produced and how productive we were,\u201d she said.",
      "She added, \u201cAnd we have so much to talk about, that we actually love unplugging and just talking at the end of each night.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s the \u2018best part\u2019 of her life",
      "In 2017, Longoria told People that Bast\u00f3n is \u201cthe best part\u201d of her life.",
      "\u201cSome days it feels like we\u2019ve been together 40 years and other days it feels like we just met,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just so compatible. He\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s go paddle boarding,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Great!\u2019 I\u2019ll say, \u2018Let\u2019s have sushi,\u2019 and he goes, \u2018Sure.\u2019 We love the same things \u2014 family, friends and traveling \u2014 so there\u2019s not a lot we\u2019ve learned separately about each other, but there\u2019s a lot we learned together about life.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n takes fashion seriously",
      "Bast\u00f3n is a stylish guy, Longoria says. She revealed hr nickname for him in an interview with People in 2015.",
      "\u201cWe call him \u2018Mr. Fancy Pants\u2019 because he always has a pocket square and a suit,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s super stylish. He loves fashion way more than I do!\u201d",
      "The family recently moved out of the US",

      "\u201cI had my whole adult life here,\u201d she said of their former neighborhood in Los Angeles. \u201cBut even before (the pandemic), it was changing. The vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge. It just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m privileged,\u201d Longoria added. \u201cI get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren\u2019t so lucky. They\u2019re going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.\u201d",
      "Though Longoria no longer lives in L.A., she still has a lot of love for the area.",
      "In the Jan. 14 episode of TODAY With Jenna & Friends, Longoria said that her charity organization, the Eva Longoria Foundation, has pledged to donate $1 million to the Latino Community Foundation and the California Community Foundation for their wildfire relief efforts.",

    "summary": "YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband James Stauffer gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son in 2020. A new documentary explores the controversy.",
    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube. And in a now-completed case, local authorities investigated the \u201cwell-being\u201d of Huxley Stauffer in response to compaints. No charges were filed.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to the Stauffers' attorney and did not get a response. In 2020, in a statement to People magazine, Myka and James Stauffer\u2019s lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said:",
      "\u201cWe are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley ... In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince his adoption, they consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas in order to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care,\u201d Taneff and Sayers continued. \u201cOver time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family.\u201d",
      "In the adoption world, failed adoptions are called \u201cdisruptions.\u201d While a disruption may seem stone-hearted from the outside, according to experts TODAY.com spoke with, these  anguished acts are complex and soul-crushing for all concerned.",
      "Myka Stauffer responded to some of the backlash in an Instagram post on June 24, 2020. That screenshot remains the most recent post on her page.",
      "\"I am sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning,\" she wrote, adding, \"I was naive, foolish and arrogant.\"",
      "She also debunked a few rumors, writing that the Stauffers \"did not adopt a child to gain wealth.\"",
      "The new, three-episode documentary airing this week called \"An Update On Our Family\" looks at the broader world of family vlogging through the lens of the Stauffer family's story."

In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes.

He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "BEIJING \u2014 As he prepares to leave Beijing, the U.S. envoy to China feels relations between the two rival powers are the most stable they\u2019ve been in recent years. But there\u2019s no guarantee they will stay that way.",
      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "The decision to ban Manuel Arias, who is the acting president of the Panamanian Football Federation known as FEPAFUT, means he will be barred \u00a0by the international football governing body for six months.",
      "\"President Arias was sanctioned for 6 months until July 14, 2025, a period during which he will not be able to participate in activities related to federated football,\" a statement from FEPAFUT said late Thursday.",
      "As replacement, First Vice President Fernando Arce will be taking over the lead duties, the statement added.",

      "City announced the deal \u2014 covering 10 years from the start of this season \u2014 on Friday for the 24-year-old Haaland, who has scored 111 goals in 125 games since joining the club from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 to establish himself as\u00a0one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "The deal is the longest in the Premier League, with Haaland reportedly earning around 500,000 pounds ($600,000) per week.",
      "Asked what his reaction was when told of the unusual length of Haaland\u2019s contract, City manager Pep Guardiola replied: \u201cI said, \u2018Can you repeat?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cNow I want to keep developing, keep working to get better and look to do my best to try and help us achieve more success going forward,\u201d Haaland said in a City statement.",
      "The new deal for Haaland comes as City awaits a verdict after being charged with 115 breaches of the Premier League\u2019s financial rules. Possible sanctions include a points deduction or relegation from the top division.",
      "Among\u00a0the promotional material published by City\u00a0to announce the Haaland deal, the striker said tellingly: \u201cNow I am City no matter what.\u201d",
      "In one of the videos, Haaland is seen calling City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak to say: \u201cIt\u2019s all signed now.\u201d",

      "It kickstarts what looks like being a busy few weeks for City, which is expected to buy multiple players with the team enduring its worst season since Guardiola joined as manager in 2016.",
      "City is sixth in the Premier League after 21 games of a title defense that has been derailed by injuries to key players and a dip in form of others. Guardiola\u2019s team isn\u2019t even sure of advancing to the knockout stage of the Champions League, either, and has a crucial game against Paris Saint-Germain next week.",
      "City has been linked with signing striker Omar Marmoush from Eintracht Frankfurt and young defenders Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens and Vitor Reis from Palmeiras. They would reportedly cost more than $150 million.",
      "\u201cI am really confident that we will turn things around,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cThings have been difficult as we are so used to winning games, but also it is a challenge for us.",
      "\u201cTo get this feeling of hunger inside every single one of us to not look at things easier. Don\u2019t take things for granted, that is an important thing. I will do everything I can to change things around.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.\u2019s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\u201cShe enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\u201d",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Seagull\u201d to William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice.\u201d She stunned in Eugene Ionesco\u2019s \u201cThe Chairs,\u201d and George Bernard Shaw\u2019s totemic two female roles \u201cMajor Barbara\u201d and \u201cSaint Joan.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been very privileged to have such a life,\u201d Plowright said in a 2010 interview with The Actor\u2019s Work. \u201cI mean it\u2019s magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there\u2019s no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\u201d",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor."

      "Bird strikes that impact both engines are also rare occurrences in aviation globally, though there have been successful cases of pilots landing the plane without fatalities in such situations including the\u00a0\u201cMiracle on the Hudson\u201d\u00a0river landing in the U.S. in 2009 and a\u00a0cornfield landing\u00a0in Russia in 2019."

      "Two sources with knowledge of the action told Reuters one aim of Thursday\u2019s sanctions was to show that Washington was not picking sides.",

      "While there have been some improvements in getting humanitarian assistance into\u00a0Sudan\u00a0through U.S. diplomacy, they have not seen an end to the conflict, \u201cnot an end to the abuses, not an end to the suffering of people,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep working here for the next three days, and I hope the next administration will take that on as well.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump didn\u2019t hide his disdain for the State Department in his first term, dismissing it as the \"Deep State Department,\" a nickname that implied a cabal of career diplomats were subverting his foreign policy goals.",
      "In the new term that starts Monday, Trump may have come up with a workaround, empowering a series of special envoys whose main responsibilities are whatever missions he gives them to carry out.",
      "The arrangement jibes with Trump\u2019s larger goal of stocking important government jobs with people he deems loyal to his agenda.",
      "But the fast-growing latticework of special envoys, ambassadors and foreign policy professionals creates the potential for duplication that may confuse foreign capitals about who\u2019s really running things, critics contend.",
      "In Britain alone, no fewer than three incoming officials may be able to rightly claim they have Trump's ear or know his thinking.",
      "There's Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state and onetime political rival; Warren Stephens, the billionaire investment banker nominated to be the ambassador; and Mark Burnett, the incoming special envoy who produced \"The Apprentice,\" the television show that amped up Trump\u2019s celebrity.",
      "\"I'm mystified by the notion that you would have an ambassador to the United Kingdom and a special envoy to the United Kingdom.

      "As Trump described it, their mission is to bring movies to foreign countries and thus improve Hollywood\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Not all of the envoys have Trump\u2019s confidence. He named Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as a deputy to Witkoff, but he wrote in the announcement that he was doing so to appease fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cEarly on, Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating. (Ortagus said on Fox News in 2016 that she disagreed with Trump\u2019s \u201cisolationist approach to foreign policy.\u201d)",
      "Many presidents have seen value in bringing in special envoys to tackle thorny problems abroad. It\u2019s a way of reassuring Americans that the White House is focusing attention on particular trouble spots.",
      "If the envoys exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d on the government\u2019s behalf, they must be confirmed by the Senate, according to an aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",

      "\u201cA special envoy can pull away responsibility from the bureaus and senior [foreign service officers], with the predictable effect on morale and the [State Department\u2019s] ability to function effectively,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition, the secretary does not have the capacity to supervise them all.\u201d",
      "That report came out 11 years ago. A spokesman for the association said that \u201cour position has not changed\u201d since then."

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The United States will not abandon its allies in the Pacific and the incoming Trump administration should renew its commitment to providing\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0with the means to defend itself, former Vice President\u00a0Mike\u00a0Pence\u00a0said in Taipei on Friday.",
      "Trump\u2019s first administration, in which\u00a0Pence\u00a0served, offered strong support for Beijing-claimed\u00a0Taiwan, including the regularization of arms sales.",
      "But Trump, who takes office on Monday for a second term, unnerved\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0on the campaign trail by calling for the democratically governed island to pay to be defended and accusing it of stealing U.S. semiconductor business.",
      "Making his first visit to\u00a0Taiwan,\u00a0Pence\u00a0said he prayed for a peaceful future for the region.",
      "\u201cI am convinced that America will never abandon our allies across the Pacific, and I call on the new administration in Washington and freedom-loving nations around the world to urgently renew our commitment for providing\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0with the support it needs to defend itself and its freedom,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to military support, the Trump administration should also begin negotiations for a free trade pact with Taiwan, Pence added, a deal the government in Taipei has long sought.",
      "Pence, who arrived in\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0after a visit to Hong Kong, said there was broad, bipartisan agreement in Washington that China represented the greatest strategic and economic threat facing the United States and its allies in this century.",
      "\u201cWhile America\u2019s perception of China has changed greatly in recent years, I can assure you one thing has not changed, and that is the deep respect and support of the American people for the people of\u00a0Taiwan.\u201d",
      "Republicans Trump and\u00a0Pence\u00a0have had a strained relationship since the end of Trump\u2019s first term, from 2017 through 2021. During that time,\u00a0Pence\u00a0served Trump loyally but refused Trump\u2019s demand that he overturn his 2020 election defeat on Jan. 6, 2021, before Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Taiwan\u00a0has no formal relations with the United States, which, like most countries, only has diplomatic ties with China, but Washington is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.",
      "China has ramped up its military pressure against\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0and refuses to speak to its president, Lai Ching-te, saying he is a \u201cseparatist.\u201d",
      "Lai has offered talks with Beijing but rejects its sovereignty claims, saying only\u00a0Taiwan\u2019s people can decide their future."

    "summary": "South Korea\u2019s anti-corruption agency said Friday that it would ask a Seoul court to extend the detention of arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea\u00a0\u2014\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u2019s anti-corruption agency said Friday that it would ask a Seoul court to extend the detention of arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol as the impeached leader again refused to be questioned by investigators.",
      "On Wednesday, Yoon became the first sitting\u00a0South\u00a0Korean president to be\u00a0arrested, over an investigation into whether he committed insurrection when he briefly imposed\u00a0martial law\u00a0in early December. He is being held at the Seoul Detention Center.",
      "In order to hold Yoon in custody for longer, investigators at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) that is leading the inquiry need to\u00a0request\u00a0a court to approve a detention warrant for up to 20 days.",
      "\u201cI think you can consider it almost finished,\u201d a CIO official told reporters, responding to a question on whether investigators were set to\u00a0file\u00a0a\u00a0request\u00a0to detain Yoon further.",
      "The official told reporters that Yoon\u2019s current arrest term was due to expire by Friday evening.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court struck down a challenge on Thursday from Yoon\u2019s lawyers over the legality of his arrest.",
      "The former president stonewalled efforts by the CIO to interrogate him on Thursday and again on Friday while his party has capitalized on political polarization to improve its approval ratings since Yoon\u2019s arrest, polling showed.",
      "\u201cHe has fully stated his basic position on the first day (of the arrest), and we believe there is no reason or need to answer the Q&A-style back-and-forth,\u201d Yoon\u2019s lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, said in a statement.",
      "The suspended president\u2019s legal team denies that Yoon masterminded an insurrection, a crime in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0punishable by life imprisonment or even technically by the death penalty.",
      "Seok said Friday that he expected investigators to seek a detention warrant but that he hoped there would be a more careful and comprehensive consideration of the arrest\u2019s \u201cillegality\u201d when a court reviewed the warrant.",
      "South\u00a0Korea\u00a0is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, set off by Yoon\u2019s brief attempt to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that stunned the nation and was swiftly voted down by parliament.",
      "Yoon was impeached on Dec. 14 and faces a Constitutional Court trial that started this week to decide whether to permanently suspend his powers or return him to office.",
      "Opinion polls have shown most\u00a0South\u00a0Koreans support his impeachment, but Yoon\u2019s legal plight and defiance over his arrest appear to have fired up some of his supporters.",
      "The approval rating for Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party was 39% in a Gallup\u00a0Korea\u00a0poll released on Friday, up from 34% a week earlier and for the first time since August overtaking the main opposition Democratic Party, which stood at 36%.",
      "Gallup\u00a0Korea\u00a0said that Yoon and his party\u2019s constant messaging toward supporters appeared to have had an impact when political divisions deepened around his arrest.",
      "Yoon was arrested after a weeks-long standoff when more than 3,000 police officers swooped in on his residence. A previous attempt to arrest him on Jan. 3 failed after an hours-long standoff between investigators and Yoon\u2019s personal security.",
      "Kim Sung-hoon, acting chief of the Presidential Security Service, was arrested on Friday for blocking investigators\u2019 initial attempt on Jan. 3 to arrest Yoon, Yonhap said.",
      "Speaking to reporters, Kim said he was carrying out his \u201clegitimate security duties\u201d and denied allegations by some opposition lawmakers that Yoon ordered guards to use weapons against investigators trying to arrest him.",
      "While key ally Washington has criticized Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law, national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned last week that there was a\u00a0risk that nuclear-armed North\u00a0Korea\u00a0could try to exploit the political situation in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea.",
      "North\u00a0Korea\u00a0has largely avoided public comment on the situation in Seoul, but Yoon\u2019s arrest was reported in state media on Friday, two days after the event.",
      "The Rodong Sinmun newspaper cited foreign media to say it was the first arrest of an incumbent president in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea.",
      "\u201cYoon Suk Yeol is not following legal procedures at the expense of the national order for individual interests,\u201d Rodong Sinmun said."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 04:48:17 GMT",
    "summary": "China\u2019s population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world\u2019s second most populous nation.",
    "story": [
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 China\u2019s population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world\u2019s second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working-age people.",
      "China\u2019s population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and other nations and territories have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and childbirth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that\u2019s not enough to keep up with the rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong\u2019s death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry that the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived of an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\u201d",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining work force, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is 60 or older, with the official figure given as 310.3 million, or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, setting off discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which is one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world\u2019s second-largest economy but facing major headwinds, will \u201cgrow old before it grows rich.\u201d",
      "Government inducements including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs have had only temporary effects."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 China is sending Vice President Han Zheng to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington, Chinese state media reported Friday, the first time a senior Chinese leader will have attended a new U.S. president\u2019s swearing-in.",
      "\u201cWe are willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the new U.S. government, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations, and find a way for China and the U.S. to get along correctly,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement announcing the trip by Han, who sometimes fills in for President Xi Jinping in ceremonial roles.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, confirmed that Han is planning to attend as \"President Xi Jinping's special representative\" and said the invitation was extended by \"the U.S. side.\"",
      "Liu's statement largely echoed the comments from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, saying the country hopes to achieve \"win-win cooperation in viewing and growing its relationship with the United States.\"",
      "A representative for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Trump transition team said last month that it had invited Xi to the event in a highly unusual move that experts said was mostly a symbolic gesture. Foreign heads of state do not typically attend U.S. presidential inaugurations, sending diplomats or other top-level officials, instead.",
      "U.S. relations with China, its top geopolitical rival, have been turbulent in recent years as the two countries clashed over a variety of issues, including technology, trade, human rights and the status of Taiwan. But in the estimation of President Joe Biden\u2019s outgoing U.S. envoy to China, those relations have stabilized during his administration after having reached their lowest point in decades.",
      "Trump has long boasted of his relationship with Xi, calling him \u201cbrilliant\u201d and praising him as a strong leader. China has become more authoritarian since Xi came to power more than a decade ago, and he is serving a rare third consecutive term.",
      "\u201cI think we will probably get along very well, I predict. But you know, it\u2019s got to be a two-way street,\u201d Trump told the conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt this month, accusing China of \u201cripping off\u201d the United States economically.",
      "Trump told Hewitt that he and Xi had a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d until the last year of his first term, when he criticized Beijing over its handling of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Trump also said he and Xi had been speaking through representatives. The Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry did not confirm any exchanges through Trump\u2019s and Xi\u2019s aides but said China and the United States had been in contact in various ways.",
      "Trump has named a number of China hard-liners among his Cabinet picks, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., his nominee for secretary of state, who is under Chinese government sanctions over his criticism of the crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, Beijing and Washington imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on each other in a \u201ctrade war\u201d that may worsen in his new administration, economic experts have said.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs of 60% or more on all Chinese goods imports, and after his election he said he would slap an additional 10% tariff on China unless it stops the international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid fentanyl.",
      "Trump has also expressed opposition to a looming ban on TikTok after earlier having supported a law requiring its Chinese parent company to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is among the tech leaders expected to attend the inauguration Monday, a day after the ban is set to take effect."
