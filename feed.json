      "The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",
      "Carpenter revealed the title and release date for her new album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d on Wednesday. The image shows Carpenter, dressed in a black dress and high heels, kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair. On social media, some fans said the image was demeaning while others argued it was satirical.",
      "The album would be eligible for the new category if she releases \u201cMan's Best Friend\u201d on Aug. 29, as promised. The Grammy eligibility period closes the next day.",
      "Other Grammy changes include the creation of a best traditional country album category, while the existing best country album category has been renamed best contemporary country album. (Beyonc\u00e9 won best country album at the 2025 Grammy Awards for \"Cowboy Carter.\")",
      "The best new artist category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations set to be announced on Nov. 7.",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",
      "Asked his favorite, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve all been good, for different reasons. The first one was great, the last one was great.\u201d",

      "The helium-powered hot-air balloon that lit up the French capital's skyline during the 2024 Games is making a dramatic comeback to the Tuileries Gardens, reborn as the \u201cParis Cauldron.\u201d",
      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",

      "Vice President JD Vance has made a brief trip to Montana to meet with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, his son Lachlan and a group of other Fox News executives",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday made a brief trip to Montana, where he spoke to media mogul Rupert Murdoch; his son Lachlan Murdoch, the head of Fox News and News Corp.; and a group of other Fox News executives, according to two people familiar with the trip.",
      "Vance met with the group at the Murdoch family ranch in southwest Montana near Dillon, according to the people. They confirmed the visit to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the vice president addressed the group or what they spoke about.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",
      "According to flight restrictions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the vice presidential aircraft was only on the ground for a matter of hours.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",
      "Rupert Murdoch and his media organization have long been friendly with Republicans and have, for the most part, had a friendly relationship with Trump. He appeared at Trump's inauguration and was spotted earlier this year in the Oval Office.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, 94, stepped down as the head of Fox News and News Corp. in 2023 and handed control over to son Lachlan.",
      "Montana state Auditor James Brown told the Montana Talks radio show that he helped Vance\u2019s staff arrange the trip.",
      "Brown, who did not respond to a message Wednesday from the AP, said he met the vice president when Vance landed at the airport and then helped escort Vance\u2019s entourage on an hourlong drive by driving second lady Usha Vance\u2019s staff.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations.

      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",

      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "(RNS) \u2014 When he was a teenager in the 1990s, Jordan Morris was always up for a bit of mischief \u2014 as long as it didn\u2019t involve sex or drugs, two things he was sure would kill him.",
      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits. We can toilet paper the pastor\u2019s house and clean it up later. And I just don\u2019t have to worry that someone is going to try and pressure me into something that I\u2019m scared of.\u201d",
      "Now a Los Angeles-based comedy writer and podcaster, Morris has fond memories of his time in youth group. Those memories \u2014 and his love for horror movies like \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d \u2014 inspired him to write \u201cYouth Group,\u201d a graphic novel about church teens who fight demons while singing silly songs about Jesus.",

      "This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.",
      "___",
      "Think \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d \u2014 the 1990s hit movie and later television series \u2014 goes to church.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be a fun challenge,\u201d Morris, whose previous graphic novel, \u201cBubble,\u201d was nominated for an Eisner Award, told Religion News Service in an interview earlier this year. \u201cCan we do one of those religious horror stories, but make it kind of funny?\u201d",
      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "The daughter of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, told a new documentary she believes her father \u201cmost likely\u201d responsible",
      "NEW YORK -- The daughter of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann believes he \u201cmost likely\u201d committed the infamous killings in New York even as her mother steadfastly defends her ex-husband\u2019s innocence in a new documentary released Tuesday.",
      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",
      "Heuermann\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The Manhattan architect has been charged with killing seven women, most of them sex workers, and dumping their bodies on a desolate parkway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Manhattan.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty and is due back in Riverhead court June 17 as a judge continues to weigh whether to allow key DNA evidence into the trial.",
      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",
      "The documentary was produced by rapper 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unit Film and Television production company alongside Texas Crew Productions and New York Post Entertainment.",

      "Oscar-nominated \u201cPast Lives\u201d filmmaker Celine Song's new film \u201cMaterialists\u201d was inspired by the brief time she worked as a matchmaker in New York",
      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

    "story": [
      "Harm reductions initiatives are becoming more commonplace at major music festivals, both through partnerships with festival organizers as well as volunteer efforts done without explicit permission",
      "NEW YORK -- The sounds of muffled percussion and audience cheers reverberate throughout the grounds. Brand activations, makeshift bars and restaurant pop-ups control traffic as a sea of bodies move from set to set. Sandwiched between is a row of nonprofits across familiar causes: hunger, housing and voter registration.",
      "It's a common music festival scene, until closer inspection. There is a new table, This Must Be the Place. The Ohio-based nonprofit offers attendees free opioid overdose reversal treatment and training on how to use it, an education acquired in under two minutes. Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had four phone conversations with Ms. Winfrey,\u201d Lamb said in a statement, remembering how she called to praise his debut novel, \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d upon its release, in 1992. Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",
      "\u201cI was as shocked as ever last month when I answered the phone and heard Ms. Winfrey\u2019s voice again, twenty-seven years after the last time we had talked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me my latest novel, \u2018The River Is Waiting,\u2019 would be the 115th title in her beloved Book Club.

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter",
      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "The girl's family says that her Minnesota school district didn\u2019t do enough to make sure she has the accommodations she needs to learn, including failing to provide adequate instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent.",

That\u2019s because courts in that part of the country require plaintiffs in lawsuits against schools to show officials used \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d a higher legal standard than most disability discrimination claims.",
      "The family appealed to the Supreme Court. The district, Osseo Area Schools, said that lowering the legal standard could expose the country\u2019s understaffed public schools to more lawsuits if their efforts fall short, even if officials are working in good faith.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",

      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",
      "Pills can arrive in a less than a week.",
      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",

      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "MADRID -- Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on Thursday asked the nation for forgiveness after a close confidant in his Socialist Party was put under investigation for his alleged participation in a kickback scheme.",
      "The damaging case is the latest legal scandal \u2014 none of which have gone beyond the preliminary investigation phase \u2014 that have dogged S\u00e1nchez's inner party circle and his family for the past year. S\u00e1nchez himself hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "\u00a8I want to ask forgiveness to the public because the Socialist Party and myself as its general secretary not should have trusted him,\" he said, referring to Socialist lawmaker Santos Cerd\u00e1n.",
      "S\u00e1nchez spoke hours after Spain\u2019s Supreme Court said that Cerd\u00e1n is suspected of being involved in an alleged kickback scheme for government contracts. It was part of an ongoing investigation that already had pointed to the participation of another former minister in S\u00e1nchez's government.",
      "Cerd\u00e1n was the Socialist Party\u2019s No. 3 official until he resigned from that post on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI have known Santos Cerd\u00e1n since 2011 ... and worked arm in arm with him,\u201d he said, adding that no matter what happens in the court case \u201cthis is an enormous disappointment.\u201d",
      "Speaking at the Socialist Party headquarters in Madrid, S\u00e1nchez repeatedly asked Spaniards for forgiveness and said that he had learned of the corruption charges against Cerd\u00e1n only hours before. S\u00e1nchez said that Cerd\u00e1n is defending his innocence.",
      "The public act of contrition by S\u00e1nchez comes around 14 months after he took five days off to consider his political future when a judge launched an investigation into his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, for alleged influence peddling. Instead of resigning, he said he would fight on and denounced what he called a \u201csmear campaign\u201d by media outlets aligned with right-wing political leanings.",
      "On Thursday, the Spanish leader said that he would order an external audit of the Socialist Party's accounts, but he refused to call an early election like his political opponents have demanded for months.",
      "\u201cThere won't be elections until 2027, because this is not about me or the Socialist Party. This is about a project to bring positive change to the country,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Despite leading a minority government, S\u00e1nchez said that he was sure he could finish out his four-year term. He has so far maintained the backing of his government's junior members and a myriad of smaller regional and leftist parties in parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is no crisis in my government,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "As secretary of the Socialist Party organization, Cerd\u00e1n held the third-most powerful position in the prime minister's party.",
      "Shortly after the court made public that there were sufficient indications that Cerd\u00e1n was involved in the alleged kickback scheme, Cerd\u00e1n renounced his seat in parliament and his party posts. While never a minister, Cerd\u00e1n was charged with sensitive political negotiations, including the key talks between the Socialists and Catalan separatist parties that allowed S\u00e1nchez to form a new government in late 2023.",
      "One of Europe\u2019s longest-serving leaders, the 53-year-old S\u00e1nchez has displayed adroit negotiating skills to stay in power since 2018, when he led Spain\u2019s only successful no-confidence motion against his conservative Popular Party predecessor.",
      "This week, Spain's Supreme Court also announced that it would put the country's prosecutor general on trial over allegations of leaking confidential information in a tax fraud case involving the boyfriend of Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the conservative head of the Madrid region and one of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s main political rivals.",
      "Last Sunday, tens of thousands of people protested in Madrid against S\u00e1nchez in a rally that was organized by the Popular Party under the slogan \u201cmafia or democracy.\"",

They were still investigating whether that was a factor.",
      "The attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.",
      "The assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.",
      "He opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.",
      "A search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to \u201can apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,\u201d but offered no \u201cindication for a motive.\u201d",
      "They also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack \u201cdown to the smallest detail\" \u2014 setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.",
      "Lohnegger said a picture had emerged of \u201ca very introverted person\u201d who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.",
      "\u201cBut even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,\u201d he added. The man had no previous police record and \u201cthere were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.\u201d",
      "The shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.",
      "He had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.",
      "Starting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.",
      "The slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.",

      "Judges at the European Court of Human Rights ruled Thursday that Italy could not be held liable for the actions of the Libyan Coast Guard, rejecting a case brought by a group of migrants rescued from the Mediterranean Sea in a fatal boat sinking in 2017.",
      "The Strasbourg court declared the case inadmissible, finding Italy did not have \u201ceffective control\u201d of the expanse of waters off the coast of Tripoli where a small ship carrying some 150 people sank in 2017.",

      "Italy has supplied the Libyans with funding, vessels and training as part of an agreement to slow the tide of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The judges found, however, that this support did not prove \u201cItaly had taken over Libya\u2019s public-authority powers.\u201d",
      "A group of migrants was rescued by the humanitarian organization Sea Watch and were taken to Italy.",
      "A ruling in favor of the 14 survivors who filed the complaint at the ECHR could have undermined international agreements made by several European Union countries with Libya, Turkey and others to prevent migrants from coming to European shores.",

      "NEW DELHI -- The Indian Coast Guard was attempting to tow a container ship that caught fire off the coast of Kerala in southern India earlier this week to prevent a potential ecological disaster, Indian authorities said Thursday.",
      "The Singapore-flagged MV Wan Hai 503 was on its way to Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital, from the Sri Lankan port of Colombo on June 7 when it reported multiple explosions and a subsequent fire some 88 nautical miles from the coast of Beypore in Kerala on Monday.",
      "Indian authorities have not yet given a reason for the explosions and fire. Officials were focused on firefighting and preventing the vessel from drifting towards the Indian coastline.",
      "The 890-foot vessel carried 2,128 metric tons of fuel and hundreds of containers, including hazardous cargo, India\u2019s defense ministry said in a statement on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cWith the fire yet to be fully extinguished, efforts to establish a towline to pull the vessel away from the coast are underway,\" the ministry said. \u201cThe situation remains critical and is being monitored continuously.\u201d",
      "The firefighting efforts have significantly reduced visible flames, but the fire remains active on the ship's inner decks and near the fuel tanks, the ministry added.",
      "Around 40% of the fire onboard the ship has been brought under control and the vessel remains afloat, according to a situation report by India\u2019s Directorate General of Shipping.",
      "The coast guard launched an aerial firefighting operation Thursday morning using a helicopter from the Indian air force, Commandant Amit Uniyal, a spokesperson for the coast guard, said. The helicopter dispersed 1,000 kilograms of dry chemical powder onto the core fire areas of the ship, he added.",
      "Shipping official Captain Harinder Singh told The Associated Press the vessel was carrying a total of 1,754 containers, including 143 with cargo deemed dangerous by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, such as flammable liquids, toxic substances and solid hazardous materials.",

      "The coast guard successfully established a towline from the vessel to a coast guard ship to control its drift.",
      "Singh, who is closely coordinating the operation, said authorities were working to establish a second towline with Offshore Warrior, a more powerful offshore supply ship with greater towing capabilities. Towing is expected to commence later Thursday.",
      "The salvage master onboard the ship observed hydrocarbon vapors which indicates possible heat transfer near fuel tanks, the report said.",
      "The vessel is managed by Singapore-based Wan Hai Lines. Of the 22 crew members onboard, 18 abandoned the ship with assistance from the navy and coast guard. Four are still missing.",
      "The navy and coast guard have launched a search operation for the missing, aided by two Dornier aircrafts. The navy uses Dornier aircraft primarily for maritime surveillance, search and rescue operations. Five ships have also been sent to help put out the fire.",
      "Last month, a container vessel sank in another accident off the Kerala coast, releasing 100 cargo containers into the Arabian Sea, and leaving authorities in the state scrambling to contain an oil spill.",

      "He noted that the UK's government also reviewed the deal, the centerpiece of a three-way alliance known as AUKUS after it was elected, and that his own government had looked at it as part of its own review of Australia's entire defense posture.",
      "\"I think an incoming government having a look at this is something that they have a perfect right to do and we welcome it and we\u2019ll work with it,\u201d he said.",

      "Thursday's case, which was over comments Imamoglu made over the prosecution of other officials from his Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, is one of numerous criminal allegations Imamoglu faces.",
      "The mayor was arrested in March alongside other prominent politicians as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. His arrest triggered the largest street protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade.",
      "A conviction in any of the cases could see Imamoglu banned from holding or running for public office.",
      "Imamoglu is regarded as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2019s 22-year rule and was officially nominated as his party\u2019s presidential candidate following his imprisonment. Turkey\u2019s next election is due in 2028 but could come sooner.",
      "In a statement, the CHP said neither Imamoglu nor his legal team would attend Thursday's hearing due to a change in venue through \u201cunlawful procedures.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu, in a post from jail, described the hearing as \u201cirregular\u201d and said it \u201cdoes not comply with the principles of the trial. I refuse to be a part of such a process and therefore I will not attend this hearing.\u201d",
      "CHP Istanbul Provincial Chairman Ozgur Celik posted on X that the hearing had been moved from Caglayan courthouse in central Istanbul to Silivri prison 24 hours beforehand. Imamoglu is being held at the prison, west of Istanbul.",
      "Prosecutors have requested a prison sentence of two to four years and a political ban on charges of \u201cattempting to influence\u201d an expert witness in the case. The hearing was adjourned to Sept. 26.",
      "Officials from CHP-controlled municipalities have faced waves of arrests this year. Many people in Turkey consider the cases to be politically driven, according to opinion polls. Erdogan\u2019s government insists the courts are impartial and free from political involvement.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The death toll in floods in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape province has risen to 57, a government minister visiting the scene of the disaster said Thursday.",
      "Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa said the flooding around the town of Mthatha in southeastern South Africa was \u201ca real disaster and a catastrophe when we have so many people dying.\u201d",
      "Rescue teams had earlier begun a third day of searching for missing people after floods devastated parts of one of South Africa's poorest provinces. Authorities had reported 49 deaths on Wednesday but said they expected that number to rise as rescue teams continued to work after the flooding hit the town of Mthatha and surrounding areas in the predawn hours of Tuesday.",
      "The missing had included four high school students who were swept away when their bus was caught up in the floods near a river on Tuesday. Six students on the bus were confirmed dead, while three were rescued after clinging onto trees and calling out for help, according to the provincial government.",
      "The floods hit the province after an extreme cold front brought heavy rain, strong winds and snow to parts of eastern and southern South Africa. Forecasters had warned about the damaging weather last week.",
      "Eastern Cape provincial government officials had said Wednesday they believed people were still missing but did not give an exact number. They were working with families to find out who was still unaccounted for, they said.",
      "On Wednesday, rescue teams brought bodies out of the water in blue body bags, while witnesses said many people had taken refuge on the top of buildings or in trees.",
      "The floods centered on Mthatha and its surrounding district, which is around 430 kilometers (267 miles) south of the east coast city of Durban.",
      "Officials said at least 58 schools and 20 hospitals were damaged, while hundreds of families were left homeless after their houses were submerged under water or washed away by the floods. Critical infrastructure including roads and bridges has been badly damaged, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said.",
      "He said it was one of the worst weather-related disasters his province had experienced.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced he had activated the National Disaster Management Center to help local authorities in the Eastern Cape and said he would visit the area on Friday.",

      "A Pakistani crackdown on Afghans has seen some families handed deadlines of hours, or just minutes, to collect whatever they can and leave forever",
      "TORKHAM, Afghanistan -- The order was clear and indisputable, the timeline startling. You have 45 minutes to pack up and leave Pakistan forever.",
      "Sher Khan, a 42-year-old Afghan, had returned home from his job in a brick factory. He stared at the plainclothes policeman on the doorstep, his mind reeling. How could he pack up his whole life and leave the country of his birth in under an hour?",
      "In the blink of an eye, the life he had built was taken away from him. He and his wife grabbed a few kitchen items and whatever clothes they could for themselves and their nine children. They left everything else behind at their home in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.",
      "Born in Pakistan to parents who fled the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing war, Khan is one of hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have now been expelled.",
      "The nationwide crackdown, launched in October 2023, on foreigners Pakistan says are living in the country illegally has led to the departures of almost 1 million Afghans already.",
      "Pakistan says millions more remain. It wants them gone.",
      "\u201cAll our belongings were left behind,\u201d Khan said as he stood in a dusty, windswept refugee camp just across the Afghan border in Torkham, the first stop for expelled refugees. \u201cWe tried so hard (over the years) to collect the things that we had with honor.\u201d",
      "Pakistan set several deadlines earlier this year for Afghans to leave or face deportation. Afghan Citizen Card holders had to leave the capital Islamabad and Rawalpindi city by March 31, while those with Proof of Registration could stay until June 30. No specific deadlines were set for Afghans living elsewhere in Pakistan.",
      "Khan feared that delaying his departure beyond the deadline might have resulted in his wife and children being hauled off to a police station along with him a blow to his family\u2019s dignity.",
      "\u201cWe are happy that we came (to Afghanistan) with modesty and honor,\u201d he said. As for his lost belongings, \u201cGod may provide for them here, as He did there.\u201d",
      "At the Torkham camp, run by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government, each family receives a SIM card and 10,000 Afghanis ($145) in aid. They can spend up to three days there before having to move on.",
      "The camp\u2019s director, Molvi Hashim Maiwandwal, said some 150 families were arriving daily from Pakistan \u2014 far fewer than the roughly 1,200 families who were arriving about two months ago. But he said another surge was expected after the three-day Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha that started June 7.",
      "Aid organizations inside the camp help with basic needs, including healthcare. Local charity Aseel provides hygiene kits and helps with food. It has also set up a food package delivery system for families once they arrive at their final destination elsewhere in Afghanistan.",
      "Aseel\u2019s Najibullah Ghiasi said they expected a surge in arrivals \u201cby a significant number\u201d after Eid. \u201cWe cannot handle all of them, because the number is so huge,\u201d he said, adding the organization was trying to boost fundraising so it could support more people.",
      "Pakistan accuses Afghans of staging militant attacks inside the country, saying assaults are planned from across the border \u2014 a charge Kabul\u2019s Taliban government denies.",
      "Pakistan denies targeting Afghans, and maintains that everyone leaving the country is treated humanely and with dignity. But for many, there is little that is humane about being forced to pack up and leave in minutes or hours.",
      "Iran, too, has been expelling Afghans, with the UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, saying on June 5 that 500,000 Afghans had been forced to leave Iran and Pakistan in the two months since April 1.",
      "Rights groups and aid agencies say authorities are pressuring Afghans into going sooner.",
      "In April, Human Rights Watch said police had raided houses, beaten and arbitrarily detained people, and confiscated refugee documents, including residence permits. Officers demanded bribes to allow Afghans to remain in Pakistan, the group added.",
      "Fifty-year-old Yar Mohammad lived in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir for nearly 45 years. The father of 12 built a successful business polishing floors, hiring several workers. Plainclothes policemen knocked on his door too. They gave him six hours to leave.",
      "\u201cNo way a person can wrap up so much business in six hours, especially if they spent 45 years in one place,\u201d he said. Friends rushed to his aid to help pack up anything they could: the company\u2019s floor-polishing machines, some tables, bed-frames and mattresses, and clothes.",
      "Now all his household belongings are crammed into orange tents in the Torkham refugee camp, his hard-earned floor-polishing machines outside and exposed to the elements. After three days of searching, he managed to find a place to rent in Kabul.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what we will do,\u201d he said, adding that he would try to recreate his floor-polishing business in Afghanistan. \u201cIf this works here, it is the best thing to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is intensifying his crackdown on dissent, a move observers suggest has been emboldened by his alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Days before his arrest outside his daughter\u2019s house in the outskirts of San Salvador, constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya called Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele a \u201cdictator\u201d and a \u201cdespot\u201d on live TV.",
      "This week, lawyer Jaime Quintanilla stood outside a detention facility in El Salvador\u2019s capital with a box of food and clothes for his client, unsure if Anaya would ever be released.",
      "The Saturday arrest of Anaya, a fierce critic of Bukele, marks the latest move in what watchdogs describe as a wave of crackdown on dissent by the Central American leader. They say Bukele is emboldened by his alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has not only praised him but avoided criticizing actions human rights defenders, international authorities and legal experts deem authoritarian.",
      "Authorities in El Salvador have targeted outspoken lawyers like Anaya, journalists investigating Bukele's alleged deals with gangs and human rights defenders calling for the end of a three-year state of emergency, which has suspended fundamental civil rights. Some say they have been forced to flee the country.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence anyone who voices an opinion \u2014 professionals, ideologues, anyone who is critical \u2014 now they\u2019re jailed.\u201d Quintanilla said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vendetta.\u201d",
      "Bukele\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Observers see a worrisome escalation by the popular president, who enjoys extremely high approval ratings due to his crackdown on the country's gangs. By suspending fundamental rights, Bukele has severely weakened gangs but also locked up 87,000 people for alleged gang ties, often with little evidence or due process. A number of those detained were also critics.",
      "Bukele and his New Ideas party have taken control of all three branches of government, stacking the country's Supreme Court with loyalists. Last year, in a move considered unconstitutional, he ran for reelection, securing a resounding victory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care if you call me a dictator,\" Bukele said earlier this month in a speech. \"Better that than seeing Salvadorans killed on the streets.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, those who have long acted as a thorn in Bukele\u2019s side say looming threats have reached an inflection point. The crackdown comes as Bukele has garnered global attention for keeping some 200 Venezuelan deportees detained in a mega-prison built for gangs as part of an agreement with the Trump administration.",
      "Anaya was detained by authorities on unproven accusations of money laundering. Prosecutors said he would be sent to \u201crelevant courts\" in the coming days. Quintanilla, his lawyer, rejects the allegations, saying his arrest stems from years of vocally questioning Bukele.",
      "Quintanilla, a longtime colleague of Anaya, said he decided to represent his friend in part because many other lawyers in the country were now too afraid to show their faces. On Tuesday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Anaya\u2019s arrest.",
      "Anaya, 61, is a respected lawyer and commentator in El Salvador with a doctorate in constitutional law. He has criticized Bukele's crackdown on the gangs and Bukele stacking of El Salvador's high court. Last year, he was among those who unsuccessfully petitioned the country\u2019s top electoral authority to reject Bukele\u2019s re-election bid, saying it violated the constitution.",
      "Days before his arrest, Anaya railed on television against the detention of human rights lawyer Ruth L\u00f3pez, who last week shouted, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to silence me, I want a public trial,\u201d as police escorted her shackled to court.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared,\u201d Anaya told the broadcast anchor. \u201cI think that anyone here who dares to speak out, speaks in fear.\u201d",
      "While some of Bukele\u2019s most vocal critics, like Anaya and L\u00f3pez, have been publicly detained, other human rights defenders have quietly slipped out of the country, hoping to seek asylum elsewhere in the region. They declined to comment or be identified out of fear that they would be targeted even outside El Salvador.",
      "Last month, a protest outside of Bukele\u2019s house was violently quashed by police and some of the protesters arrested. He also ordered the arrest of the heads of local bus companies for defying his order to offer free transport while a major highway was blocked.",
      "In late May, El Salvador\u2019s Congress passed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.",
      "Ver\u00f3nica Reyna, a human rights coordinator for the Salvadoran nonprofit Servicio Social Pasionista, said police cars now regularly wait outside her group\u2019s offices as a lingering threat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been little-by-little,\u201d Reyna said. \u201cSince Trump came to power, we\u2019ve seen (Bukele) feel like there\u2019s no government that\u2019s going to strongly criticize him or try to stop him.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s influence extends beyond his vocal backing of Bukele, with his administration pushing legal boundaries to push his agenda, Reyna, other human rights defenders and journalists said.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, which once regularly denounced the government's actions, has remained silent throughout the arrests and lingering threats. It did not respond to a request for comment. In its final year, the Biden administration, too, dialed back its criticism of the Bukele government as El Salvador's government helped slow migration north in the lead up to the 2024 election.",
      "On Tuesday, Quintanilla visited Anaya in detention for the first time since his arrest while being watched by police officers.",
      "Despite the detention, neither Anaya nor Quintanilla have been officially informed of the charges. Quintanilla worries that authorities will use wide ranging powers granted to Bukele by the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d to keep him imprisoned indefinitely.",
      "\u00d3scar Mart\u00ednez, editor-in-chief of news site El Faro, and four other journalists have left the country and are unable to return safely, as they face the prospect of arrest stemming from their reporting.",
      "At a time when many other reporters have fallen silent out of fear, Mart\u00ednez's news site has investigated Bukele more rigorously than perhaps any other, exposing hidden corruption and human rights abuses under his crackdown on gangs.",
      "In May, El Faro published a three-part interview with a former gang leader who claimed he negotiated with Bukele's administration. Soon after, Mart\u00ednez said the organization received news that authorities were preparing an arrest order for a half-dozen of their journalists. This has kept at least five El Faro journalists, including Mart\u00ednez, stranded outside their country for over a month.",
      "On Saturday, when the reporters tried to return home on a flight, a diplomatic source and a government official informed them that police had been sent to the airport to wait for them and likely arrest them.",
      "The journalists later discovered that their names, along with other civil society leaders, appeared on a list of \u201cpriority objectives\" held by airport authorities. Mart\u00ednez said Anaya's name was also on the list.",
      "Now in a nearby Central American nation, Mart\u00ednez said he doesn't know when he will be able to board another flight home. And if he does, he doesn't know what will happen when he steps off.",
      "\u201cWe fear that, if we return \u2014 because some of us surely will try \u2014 we'll be imprisoned,\u201d he said. \u201cI am positive that if El Faro journalists are thrown in prison, we'll be tortured and, possibly, even killed.\"",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday bypassed legislative opposition and signed a decree summoning voters to the polls in August to decide changes to the country\u2019s labor laws, including whether workdays should be limited to eight hours.",
      "The decree fulfilled Petro\u2019s threat to Congress to put his labor system overhaul before voters should senators not approve the 12-question referendum themselves. He issued the measure in a tense political climate following the Saturday shooting of opposition senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay during a public event.",
      "The referendum has become the crux of long-running tensions between the executive and legislative branches.",
      "After Congress rejected Petro\u2019s labor reform twice, most recently in March, he sent lawmakers a 12-question referendum proposal on May 1 as Colombian law requires that the Senate rule on the advisability of referendums. The legislative body two weeks later voted 49-47 against the measure, prompting Petro to accuse lawmakers of fraud.",
      "Petro, Colombia\u2019s first leftist president, has accused Congress of working against the interest of workers and has asked them to demonstrate across the country.",
      "The referendum\u2019s questions include whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays; whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m.; and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "The disagreements between Petro and Congress date back to the start of his term in 2022, but they have heightened as he seeks to consolidate his legacy ahead of next year\u2019s legislative and presidential elections.",
      "Uribe remained in critical condition Wednesday following his shooting in broad daylight Saturday during a political rally in the capital, Bogota. Authorities investigating the motive have not ruled out the possibility that it was a targeted attack on the opposition. They are also considering whether it was an attempt to destabilize the current government, or retaliation by illegal armed groups.",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Veteran rock star Bruce Springsteen, a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump, slammed the U.S. administration as \u201ccorrupt, incompetent and treasonous\u201d during a concert Wednesday in Berlin.",
      "He was addressing tens of thousands of fans at a stadium built for the 1936 Olympic Games that still bears the scars of World War II and contains relics from the country\u2019s dark Nazi past.",
      "\u201cTonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices, stand with us against authoritarianism, and let freedom reign,\u201d he said.",
      "Springsteen has made increasingly pointed and contentious public statements in recent concerts. He peppered Wednesday's performance with mentions of the American democracy's system of checks and balances designed to ward against authoritarianism.",
      "His short speeches \u2014 referencing recent headlines about immigration raids, the freezing of federal funds for universities and measles outbreaks \u2014 came between songs that were also captioned in German on large screens beside the stage. The set was flanked by an American flag on one side and a German flag on the other.",
      "Still, the Boss remained hopeful: \u201cThe America that I've sung to you about for the past 50 years of my life is real. And regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with great people. And we will survive this moment.\u201d",
      "But last month in Manchester, he denounced Trump's politics during a concert, calling him an \u201cunfit president\u201d leading a \u201crogue government\u201d of people who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "Springsteen is no stranger to Berlin. In July 1988, he became one of the first Western musicians to perform in East Germany, performing to a roaring crowd of 160,000 East Germans yearning for American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and the freedom it represented to the youth living under the crumbling communist regime.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not here for or against any government. I\u2019ve come to play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down,\u201d Springsteen said in German at the time, before launching into a cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cChimes of Freedom.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press news story from that period says \u201cfireworks streaked through the sky\u201d and hundreds of people in the audience waved handmade American flags as they sang along to \u201cBorn in the USA.\u201d",
      "The Berlin Wall fell the following year, and some experts credit the concert for its part in fueling the protest movement that brought the end of the Communist government.",
      "Almost four decades later, Springsteen issued a stark warning: \u201cThe America that I love, the America that I\u2019ve sung to you about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration.\"",
      "The rocker closed Wednesday's three-hour show with \u201cChimes of Freedom.\u201d",

      "At least 240 people were killed when an Air India plane crashed Thursday into a medical school shortly after takeoff. It was the latest in a long list of aviation disasters this year.",
      "One passenger survived the crash but everyone else aboard the Boeing 787 was killed. More people died on the ground after the plane crashed and generated a large fireball. Black smoke billowed from the site where the plane crashed and burst into flames near the airport in Ahmedabad, a city of more than 5 million and the capital of Gujarat.",
      "All the aircraft crashes and near misses have fueled many worries about flying.",
      "The Indian crash was far worse than the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., in January in the first major fatal crash on U.S. soil since 2009. Other recent incidents include an airliner clipping another in February while taxiing at the Seattle airport.

      "\u2014 Two different small planes crashed near San Diego over the past month. Six people died when a private jet crashed into a San Diego neighborhood in the midst of heavy fog. The runway lights weren't working at that airport. Six more people died earlier this week when a small plane crashed into the ocean shortly after taking off in San Diego.",
      "\u2014 The New York helicopter that crashed on April 10 departed a downtown heliport. The flight lasted less than 18 minutes. Radar data shows the helicopter flew north along the Manhattan skyline, then south toward the Statue of Liberty. The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",
      "\u2014 Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed April 11 in Boca Raton, Florida, near a major interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks.",
      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and two people on the ground. About two dozen people were also hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations after taking off in Colorado Springs. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries. The NTSB found a fuel leak and several improperly installed parts in the engine.",
      "\u2014 A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames that same month in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to an area burn center.",
      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Last month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",

      "\u2014 Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in late February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said.",
      "\u2014 In early February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported.",
      "\u2014 In early January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, triggering an emergency slide to inflate. Other passengers quickly restrained the man and the plane didn't take off.",

      "GREENSBORO, N.C. -- GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) \u2014 JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.",
      "The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro\u2019s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.",
      "The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing \u2014 also known as all-wing or blended-wing \u2014 Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.",
      "JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.",
      "United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.",
      "Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.",
      "\u201cNorth Carolina is the perfect location,\u201d Stein said. \u201cNorth Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.\u201d",
      "The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives.",

      "A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee \u2014 more than $1 billion over 37 years \u2014 is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers\u2019 paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.",
      "A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.",
      "JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.",
      "\u201cWe have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,\u201d CEO Tom O'Leary said. \u201cSo this is more than just a factory. It\u2019s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.\u201d",
      "While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.",
      "The 5-year-old company says the plane\u2019s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.",
      "JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.",
      "\u201cIt's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you\u2019ve ever had before on any other plane,\u201d O'Leary said.",
      "The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.",
      "The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.",

      "Former congressman Billy Long of Missouri has been confirmed to lead the Internal Revenue Service, an agency he once sought to abolish",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri was confirmed on Thursday to lead the Internal Revenue Service, giving the beleaguered agency he once sought to abolish a permanent commissioner after months of acting leaders and massive staffing cuts that have threatened to derail next year\u2019s tax filing season.",
      "The Senate confirmed Long despite Democrats\u2019 concerns about the Republican's past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after President Donald Trump nominated him to serve as IRS commissioner.",
      "While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS, the agency he is now tasked with leading. A former auctioneer, Long has no background in tax administration.",
      "Long will take over an IRS undergoing massive change, including layoffs and voluntary retirements of tens of thousands of workers and accusations that then-Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency mishandled sensitive taxpayer data. Unions and advocacy organizations have sued to block DOGE\u2019s access to the information.",
      "The IRS was one of the highest-profile agencies still without a Senate-confirmed leader. Before Long\u2019s confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent.",
      "Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long\u2019s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits.",
      "Long appeared before the Senate Finance Committee last month and denied any wrongdoing related to his involvement in the tax credit scheme.",
      "Ahead of the confirmation vote, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles blasting the requisite FBI background check conducted on Long as a political appointee as inadequate.",
      "\u201cThese issues were not adequately investigated,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cIn fact, the FBI\u2019s investigation, a process dictated by the White House, seemed designed to avoid substantively addressing any of these concerning public reports. It\u2019s almost as if the FBI is unable to read the newspaper.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers have also written to Long and his associated firms detailing concerns with what they call unusually timed contributions made to Long\u2019s defunct 2022 Senate campaign committee shortly after Trump nominated him.",
      "The IRS faces an uncertain future under Long. Tax experts have voiced concerns that the 2026 filing season could be hampered by the departure of so many tax collection workers. In April, The Associated Press reported that the IRS planned to cut as many as 20,000 staffers \u2014 up to 25% of the workforce. An IRS representative on Thursday confirmed the IRS had shed about that many workers but said the cuts amounted to approximately the same number of IRS jobs added under the Biden administration.",
      "The fate of the Direct File program, the free electronic tax return filing system developed during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, is also unclear. Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies had complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use. Long said during his confirmation hearing that it would be one of the first programs that come up for discussion if he were confirmed.",
      "Long is not the only Trump appointee to support dismantling an agency he was assigned to manage.",
      "Linda McMahon, the current education secretary, has repeatedly said she is trying to put herself out of a job by closing the federal department and transferring its work to the states. Rick Perry, Trump's energy secretary during his first term, called for abolishing the Energy Department during his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California's attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump's signing ceremony ended at the White House.",
      "The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Trump called California\u2019s regulations \u201ccrazy\u201d at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster for this country,\u201d he said.",
      "It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state's Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s actions are not only unlawful; they\u2019re irrational and wildly partisan,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cThey come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.\u201d",
      "The three resolutions Trump signed will block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.",
      "\u201cI like Tesla,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed \u201care killing our country,\u201d the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he'd risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single day,\" the president said.",
      "When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, \u201cIf you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat this does is it gives us freedom,\u201d said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install \u201cinfrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn\u2019t give you any return.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump\u2019s action.",

      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",

      "NEW YORK -- The first thing Alison Jones does when she wakes up is to name three things she\u2019s grateful for. It can be as simple as the breeze from a fan or as meaningful as the way a friend showed up for her emotionally.",
      "Jones, an organizational development consultant, said the daily practice has helped her through hardships and the anxiety and vulnerability of starting her own business as a single mom.",
      "\u201cWhen you practice gratitude, you train your brain to always look for the positive in anything. It just completely shifts everything you\u2019re going through,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start to see the lessons in the pain. You start see the beauty in the very difficult times because you realize, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m growing stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Practicing and encouraging gratitude can be a simple way to boost morale at a time when layoffs and economic uncertainty are causing stress and anxiety. Some employers have found that workers who receive expressions of gratitude show more engagement and willingness to help others.",
      "Other proponents say expressing and receiving appreciation can help reduce stress, as well as improve a person's mood and outlook.",
      "But despite its benefits, promoting gratefulness is often overlooked as a valuable way to spend time and resources in the workplace.",
      "Experts in organizational change shared ways to incorporate more gratitude into the workday.",
      "If you\u2019re new to practicing gratitude, you can start at home with a routine such as Jones\u2019 custom of expressing gratitude before getting out of bed.",
      "She made her gratitude practice easy so it would become a sustainable habit. Her one rule is avoiding repetition and stretching her mind to find new things to be grateful for each day.",
      "Jones also recommends finding a \u201cgratitude buddy\u201d to share with. A buddy may be a friend from work or your social circles, and ideas can be exchanged in person, by text or email, or during a phone call. Many people find it helpful to list what they\u2019re grateful for in a journal.",
      "At work, a team leader can begin a staff meeting by expressing gratitude for what went well in the last week, suggested Peter Bonanno, a consultant who helps companies design mindfulness-based programs.",
      "As humans, we often have a bias toward negativity, but gratitude \u201cjust does an enormous amount to shift people\u2019s mindsets and the way they engage with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cGratitude is especially powerful in that way. It doesn\u2019t take a long time for people to notice an impact.\u201d",
      "O.C. Tanner Institute, a software and service company, helps organizations find effective ways to show appreciation to their employees, such as managers giving handwritten notes of thanks. The company helped American Airlines develop a system for managers and colleagues to recognize good work with points that can be applied to a catalog order.",
      "It also helped Amway create gift boxes to celebrate workers' accomplishments and important personal milestones, such as buying a home or adopting a child.",
      "\u201cRecognition impacts so many facets of the employee experience. And when you do it well, it connects people back to a deep sense of purpose and meaning,\u201d said Meghan Stettler, a director at O.C. Tanner.",
      "Some companies donate their own products to thank nurses, doctors, police officers, firefighters and other workers who serve their communities. Frontline Builders, a nonprofit organization launched during the pandemic, connects donors of snacks, drinks and personal care items with recipients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked in that job where we weren\u2019t shown gratitude and realized how much that stinks,\u201d said Jason Lalack, partnership director at Frontline Builders. \u201cShowing someone gratitude or showing appreciation doesn\u2019t really cost anything, and shouldn\u2019t be that difficult of a thing, and yet it\u2019s rarer than it should be.\u201d",
      "Registered nurse Denise Whittsell remembers how quiet the hospital where she works became during the pandemic. The hallways of Denver Health, typically busy with families and guests, were suddenly empty as visits from outsiders were curtailed and patients battled illnesses alone.",
      "Once in a while, someone from the community would deliver gifts of gratitude: tasty snacks or handmade cards from schoolchildren.",
      "\u201cThose spontaneous recognitions were really sweet,\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt just felt really kind, and it felt like there was a lot of wrapping around us, a very supportive feeling.\u201d",
      "Whittsell is part of a team of volunteers at Denver Health's RESTORE program, which connects front-line hospital workers with trained peer responders for confidential emotional support and training.",
      "The hospital started the program as a way to improve and sustain the emotional well-being of its workforce, said Tia Henry, the program's director. Volunteers take shifts so someone is available around-the-clock to answer calls from hospital personnel who are struggling with stressful events such as losing a patient or witnessing violence.",
      "Volunteers and staff regularly express gratitude for the program, Henry said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had calls on my way to work: \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time and I need to talk with somebody who gets it,\u2019\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to give back to the people that I work with.\"",
      "Aside from peer support, RESTORE also provides training and education to employees about stress, burnout and techniques to deescalate violence, Henry said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing counseling or therapy, but we\u2019re using components of psychological first aid to truly engage timely with our teammates when they\u2019re distressed, helping them calm their nervous system and get back to the place of regulation where they can show back up and do what it is they need to do or they can lay something down and go back home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat is gratitude from my lens.\u201d",
      "Indy Public Safety Foundation, an Indianapolis nonprofit organization that supports front-line workers, shows gratitude to police, firefighters and paramedics through awards banquets, trainings, and showing up with food, shaking hands and saying thank you after a community tragedy.",

      "While front-line workers were applauded during the pandemic, \"their work has continued and arguably not gotten any less stressful, and some of that support has waned,\u201d said Dane Nutty, the foundation's president and CEO.",
      "While practicing gratitude may make for a more pleasant on-the-job environment, it's not a replacement for better working conditions. It's good to be grateful to have a job that pays the bills. It's also important to ask for what's fair.",
      "\u201cBeing grateful absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that we accept anything subpar or inappropriate,\u201d Jones said, adding that people should advocate for basic needs such as meal breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to confuse gratitude with being passive.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Toy robots that teach children to code. Sneakers made in America. Mold-resistant kitchen gadgets.",
      "The three items are among new products that have gotten stuck in the pipeline due to President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, according to the brand founders behind the stalled items. They say that instead of fostering U.S. innovation, Trump\u2019s tariffs are stifling it with extra costs and unexpected work.",
      "At Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Made Plus in Annapolis, Maryland, and Dorai Home in Salt Lake City, research and development have taken a backseat to recalculating budgets, negotiating with vendors and tracking shipments in the shifting tariff environment.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t have enough cash to cover just the restocks of the things that we know we need, do we want to take a risk on this new thing when we don\u2019t know how well it will sell yet?\u201d Dorai Home founder Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "O\u2019Callaghan started the eco-friendly home goods company with a stone bath mat and now offers about 50 kitchen and bathroom accessories, which are made in China with a non-toxic material that dries quickly. New launches are critical to increasing sales and attracting customers, she said.",
      "As Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% and as high as 145% before reducing the import tax rate to 30% for 90 days, Dorai Home postponed introducing new merchandise. O'Callaghan said she had to lay off the CEO as well as the head of product development, who helped the company jump on new trends.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t really put the time or the emphasis on (innovation) because I\u2019m covering too many other people\u2019s roles,\u201d she said.",
      "The company paused shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis after the president's rate reduction. On Wednesday, Trump touted progress  in U.S.-China trade talks.",
      "With details still sketchy and a deal not finalized, entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they viewed the tariffs war as an ongoing threat.",
      "The potential stunting of innovation follows an economic slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, when companies also had to put projects on hold. Some experts think the on-again-off again tariffs may have more enduring consequences because they rewire markets and upend business strategies.",
      "\u201cWhen executive attention shifts from innovation to regulatory compliance, the innovation pipeline suffers. Companies end up optimizing for the political landscape rather than technological advancement,\u201d economists J. Bradford Jensen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Scott J. Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute think tank, wrote in an April blog post.",
      "Trump has argued that curtailing foreign imports with tariffs would help revive the nation's diminished manufacturing base. Analysts and various trade groups have warned that fractured trade ties and supply chains may depress R&D activity of U.S. tech and health care companies that rely on international partnerships or foreign suppliers.",
      "Small companies, which often drive the innovations that create jobs and economic growth, already are under strain.",
      "With fewer people on staff and tighter budgets compared to large corporations, entrepreneurs say they are spending more time on cutting costs, suspending or arranging orders, and deciding how much of their tariff-related costs to charge customers. That means they\u2019re spending less time thinking of their next big ideas.",
      "Schylling Inc., a Massachusetts company that produces modern versions of Lava lamps, Sea-Monkeys, My Little Pony and other nostalgic toys, has its products made in China. As part of its strategy to account for tariffs, the company put a group of employees on temporary unpaid leave last month to reduce expenses.",
      "Marketing director Beth Muehlenkamp said she and other furloughed workers typically would have been planning products for the final months of 2026. But Schylling isn't focusing on designing new products given the unstable trade outlook.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus on innovation and creativity when you\u2019re consumed with this day-to-day of how we\u2019re just going to balance the books and deal with the changing rates,\u201d Muehlenkamp said.",
      "Even some companies that do their manufacturing in the U.S. are scaling back investments in new products. Made Plus, a Maryland company that makes athletic shoes at a small factory in the state capital, put a planned golf line on hold because two key components \u2014 a foam insole and the tread for the bottom of the shoe \u2014 currently are made in China, founder Alan Guyan said.",
      "The company customizes its shoes on demand and charges $145 to $200 a pair. The footwear is made from recycled plastic bottles with advanced knitting, 3D printing and computerized stitching techniques. It's looking into getting components from Vietnam instead of China.",
      "Embracing new technology is essential to restoring manufacturing capability in the U.S. and competing with Asia, Guyan said. But given ongoing trade frictions, he said he does not want to invest time or money evaluating the latest embroidery and knitting machines, which come from Germany, Italy, China and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just battening down the hatches a little bit and just hoping that there\u2019s enough influence in the community of footwear that it will somewhat change and get resolved and we can move forward,\u201d he said of the tariff roller coaster.",
      "In contrast, many big companies are forging on. Google parent Alphabet confirmed late last month that it still planned to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, with most of the money going toward artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Sonia Lapinsky, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, has advised her clients to limit tariff discussions to a small group of executives and to keep their product creation cycles in motion.",
      "Businesses have an even greater imperative to come up with attention-grabbing innovations when consumers may be reluctant to open their wallets, she said.",
      "Yet smaller companies may struggle to wall off tariff discussions from the rest of the business.",
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg said that roughly 25% to 30% of the 350 employees at the educational toy company\u2019s headquarters, including product developers, are working at least part-time on tariff-related tasks.",
      "The company usually develops 250 different products a year and expects to get half that many off the drawing board for 2026, Woldenberg said.

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants China to lift restrictions on exporting rare earths and other critical minerals that Beijing imposed as part of a yearslong trade war",
      "GANZHOU, China -- China\u2019s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.",
      "China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.",
      "Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.",
      "Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.",
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.",
      "Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.",
      "The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. first fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance.",
      "\u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d",
      "In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.",
      "Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d",
      "China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.",
      "The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.",
      "The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.",
      "Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.",
      "Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots.",
      "In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.",
      "Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.",
      "\u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.",
      "At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.",
      "Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.",
      "Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.",
      "Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.",
      "Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.",
      "The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.",
      "Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.",
      "The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d",

      "The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.",
      "The raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.",
      "Glenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.",
      "Asked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, \u201cI was very upset, ma\u2019am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.",
      "E-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.",
      "Some of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.",
      "Rohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.",
      "But that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.",
      "The Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.",
      "The raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.",
      "The Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d",
      "That fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.",
      "\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "An aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.",
      "The raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d",
      "Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.",
      "\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",
      "The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress\u2019 move to block them.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cTake Me out to the Ball Game\u201d is more than just a song sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States",
      "NEW YORK -- It's sung every summer in baseball stadiums around the United States. But the impact of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d goes much further than simply getting fans out of their seats for the 7th-inning stretch.",
      "More than a century after Jack Norworth penned the lyrics, a nonprofit founded with the song's royalties is celebrating 50 years of supporting young musicians \u2014 including the talent behind some of today's most popular musicals. The ASCAP Foundation, the charitable arm for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, was established in 1975 after Norworth's estate left a bequest of the licensing payments for baseball's unofficial anthem and his other hits.",
      "\u201cJust as all music begins with a song, the ASCAP Foundation began with a song,\u201d said Paul Williams, the group's president and a composer-lyricist whose award-winning career includes \u201cRainbow Connection.\u201d",
      "The organization provides money, lessons and mentorship at all career stages in an industry where that support is badly needed by artists who often toil for years working other gigs while trying to get their music before the right ears. To reach its semicentennial, however, the foundation has had to identify new funding streams and reinvent programming.",
      "\u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d written in 1908, has since entered the public domain and no longer generates revenue. The foundation nowadays relies on a mix of philanthropies, corporate sponsors and general public donations. The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation is a longtime backer and storied New York law firm Paul Weiss is another sponsor.",
      "And, according to Williams, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of stingy songwriters out there.\u201d The late Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, as well as Herb Alpert, are among those with named scholarships and awards. Williams said other bequests, which are charitable gifts left through a will, have come from \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d composer-lyricist Jerry Herman and \u201cTea for Two\u201d lyricist Irving Ceasar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a way of making a mark on the world and extending their values forward,\u201d fundraising coach Claire Axelrad said of bequests, which she added have consistently made up about one-tenth of charitable gifts.",
      "With dwindling arts funding and millions of children reportedly going without music education, the ASCAP Foundation is also trying to reach underserved communities. Leaders count nearly 60,000 K-12 students who participated in last year's programs. They help teach guitar to New York summer campers and bring students to free Broadway-caliber productions. Youth are learning to play the djembe, a drum originally from West Africa, through a collaboration with urban farming nonprofit Harlem Grown.",
      "Tax filings show the foundation gave away more than $325,000 in grants for scholarships, fellowships and cash awards in 2023. Award-winning songwriter Emily Bear, who co-wrote the soundtrack for Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d said the foundation took her \u201cvery seriously\" when she was a five-year-old prodigy receiving its young composer award.",
      "\u201cThat kind of validation at that kind of age means so much when you\u2019re just a little girl with very big dreams and you\u2019re in a room full of people that you idolize,\" she said.",
      "Composer Stephen Schwartz, who was honored this week with the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award during a June 10 fundraiser at Tony winner Adam Guettel\u2019s Manhattan home, said the nonprofit is filling gaps as the government \u201csupports the arts less and less.\u201d",
      "This April also marked the third year that Schwartz has hosted the foundation\u2019s two-day Musical Theatre Fest in Los Angeles. The location allows participants to get feedback from prominent guests and connect with Hollywood studios \u2014 one way the foundation is trying to stay relevant by serving the renewed interest in musicals for television and film screens.",
      "It's emblematic of the mentorship younger composers say Schwartz \u2014 a Broadway icon whose hits include \u201cGodspell,\u201d \u201cPippin\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d \u2014 has offered to emerging artists over the years.",
      "Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the songwriting duo behind \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d credited the ASCAP Foundation for \u201ccementing\u201d their connection with Schwartz. Pasek said such close proximity to a hero, who then became a \"living, breathing person who gives you advice,\u201d made the profession \u201cmore plausible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTypically, you\u2019re working on projects on a wing and a prayer and hoping that someday it reaches the stage,\u201d Paul said. \"So, an organization like the ASCAP Foundation breathing life into not just your work, but your pocketbooks, is a huge, huge support.\u201d",
      "Schwartz said it was \u201cscary and bewildering\u201d when he first started out without any connections. He sees an important role for himself as someone who can \u201cease the way a bit\u201d to help newcomers\u2019 \u201ctalents flourish earlier and more completely.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also another motivation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s slightly selfish because I get to see good work and enjoy it,\u201d Schwartz added.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety in the wake of January\u2019s deadly midair collision and a string of other crashes and near misses since then",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Federal Aviation Administration is facing tough questions about safety during a hearing Wednesday in the wake of January's deadly midair collision and a string of other crashes and near misses since then.",
      "Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford\u2019s nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.",
      "Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA\u2019s top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump\u2019s multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.",
      "Even the air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.",
      "\u201cFlying is safe, but as you know the system that manages our skies is showing its age,\" Bedford said in his prepared statement to the committee. \u201cThe stresses of this antiquated system truly came into view as we all returned to the skies after COVID.\u201d",
      "Pilots\u2019 unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to want to know ... whether you\u2019re going to lead any effort to change that rule,\u201d Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell said. She asked for a firm written answer because \u201cyou helped fund and lobbied for a change for it.\u201d",
      "Bedford acknowledged Wednesday that \u201cproblems persist and more work needs to be done\u201d to ensure the safety of flying around the nation's capital. He said his own airline's planes have received at least three alarms about conflicting traffic around Reagan since January.",

      "Hidden gems are excellent vehicles that have a lot to offer but are often overlooked by shoppers",
      "There are some new cars that many shoppers tend to overlook even though they have a lot to offer. These hidden gems boast a special combination of attractive qualities and can potentially make excellent choices for savvy folks who want their ride to stand out from the sea of mainstream vehicles. Certain slower-selling cars don\u2019t get the respect they deserve, whether due to styling, the type of vehicle, or brand image. Edmunds explores five hidden gems and the wow factor that makes them shine. Our choices are ordered by starting price, including destination fees.",
      "The Ioniq 6 is an electric sedan that does almost everything right. It\u2019s sporty and fun to drive, yet it\u2019s also comfortable and has a smooth ride over rough dips and potholes. Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",
      "Ioniq 6 starting price: $39,045",
      "The Ridgeline could be an ideal truck for you depending on your priorities. If you plan on frequently towing heavy loads and tackling serious off-road trails, then other midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger would be a better fit. But if not, you should consider the Ridgeline. It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler. It also has clever features like a lockable in-bed trunk and a tailgate that folds down or swings to the side. Its bed is large enough for 4-foot-wide plywood sheets without resting them on the wheelwells.",
      "Ridgeline starting price: $41,600",
      "Mitsubishi doesn\u2019t sell as many vehicles as giant brands like Chevrolet or Toyota. But the Outlander PHEV is surprisingly capable and versatile. It\u2019s a plug-in hybrid SUV that offers three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive. If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids. Its starting price isn\u2019t low because it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid, but the Mitsubishi comes well equipped, and the top SEL trim level is quite luxurious.",
      "2025 Outlander PHEV starting price: $42,040",
      "The Crown is a relatively new Toyota that turns heads with its distinctive design. Its styling is similar to a sedan\u2019s, but the Crown has a raised ride height that\u2019s more like a crossover SUV\u2019s. Oh, and it\u2019s a hybrid too. The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",
      "Inside, the Crown has a pleasing interior with large display screens, spacious seating and a comfortable ride. But all this comes at a cost. The Crown is pricey for a non-luxury hybrid sedan, especially the top Platinum trim that has the Hybrid Max engine.",
      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival. The most notable ones include front and rear massaging seats, a 26-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, a massive package of advanced driver aids, and an air suspension that scans the road ahead so it can adjust to road imperfections.",
      "Starting price: $91,050",
      "You\u2019ll be bucking the trend by purchasing one of these hidden gems. And because they\u2019re all highly rated by Edmunds, you\u2019ll also own a top-notch vehicle that could provide a rewarding experience.",

      "With concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, aid groups are readying to expand the ways they help communities after hurricanes, fires and other storms",
      "Volunteers with the humanitarian nonprofit Team Rubicon are accustomed to filling in the gaps of disaster recovery \u2014 they chainsaw downed trees after wildfires, muck out flooded homes and rebuild roofs blown off by hurricanes.",
      "But with concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, the group is readying to possibly help in ways it hasn\u2019t before.",
      "\u201cThe one thing certain this hurricane season is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen at the federal level,\u201d said Jeff Byard, Team Rubicon senior vice president of operations.",
      "Byard and his team are evaluating how else they can help communities if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees federal response to disasters, reduces its capacity or is deployed less often. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to overhaul FEMA, if not totally dismantle it.",
      "Team Rubicon is good at being agile, Byard said, but nonprofits and funders are already under pressure from more frequent and severe climate events. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder in a really hard situation already,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts worry Trump might approve fewer major disaster declarations, which unlock federal funding and resources, and that FEMA\u2019s response could be slowed or diminished. Trainings have been reduced, and around 2,000 employees have left or been fired since January, including high-level staff.",
      "\"Whether it's a hurricane or earthquake, the federal government is not prepared the way it has been in the past,\u201d said Michael Coen, who held posts at FEMA under three presidential administrations.",
      "Nonprofits and funders across the United States say there is too much at stake for communities to just wait and see what happens. \u201cFrom the nonprofit perspective, we have to really lean in,\u201d said Marcus Coleman, vice president of community resilience strategy for United Way Worldwide.",
      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",
      "The new responsibilities could come at a time when states, nonprofits and funders are already under strain from worsening disasters and federal funding cuts across government.",
      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",
      "\u201cWhen you're working at a homeless shelter that is 100% utilized and then you drop a disaster on it, it\u2019s \u2018How will I continue to do my job,\u2019 not \u2018How can I expand my mission.\u2019\u201d",
      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "Among the main announcements is expected to be a 30 billion-pound ($41 billion) increase in funding for Britain's cherished but struggling National Health Service, as well as a rise in defense spending that will account for 2.5% of national output by 2027. Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda along the inter-Korean border",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim in January 2024 declared that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",

      "Stocks have soared higher since dropping roughly 20% below their record two months ago, when President Donald Trump shocked financial markets  with his announcement of stiff tariffs that raised worries about a possible recession. Much of the rally has been due to hopes that Trump would lower his tariffs  after reaching trade deals with countries around the world.",

      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",

      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "The latest effort by Congress to regulate college sports is generating predictable partisan outrage",
      "WASHINGTON -- The latest effort by Congress to regulate college sports generated predictable partisan outrage on Thursday, with Democrats saying Republican-led draft legislation would claw back freedoms won by athletes through years of litigation against the NCAA.",
      "Three House committees are considering legislation that would create a national standard for name, image and likeness payments to athletes and protect the NCAA against future lawsuits. Last week, a federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will lead to schools paying athletes directly, and NCAA President Charlie Baker said now that his organization is implementing those major changes, Congress needs to step in and stabilize college sports.",
      "Baker said he supports the draft legislation that was the subject of Thursday's hearing by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, but there was little indication that any bill advanced by the House would generate enough Democratic support to surpass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed for the second year in a row, Republicans on this committee are advancing a partisan college sports bill that protects the power brokers of college athletics at the expense of the athletes themselves,\u201d said Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass.",
      "Trahan noted that if the NCAA or conferences establish unfair rules, athletes can challenge them in court, with the settlement of the House v. NCAA antitrust case the latest example of athletes winning rights that they had been denied historically.",
      "\u201cThis bill rewrites that process to guarantee the people in power always win, and the athletes who fuel this multibillion-dollar industry always lose,\u201d said Trahan, who played volleyball at Georgetown.",
      "The NCAA argues that it needs a limited antitrust exemption in order to set its own rules and preserve a college sports system that provides billions of dollars in scholarships and helps train future U.S. Olympians. Several athletes are suing the NCAA over its rule that athletes are only eligible to play four seasons in a five-year period, and on Tuesday, a group of female athletes filed an appeal of the House settlement, saying it discriminated against women in violation of federal law.",
      "On the Senate side, a bipartisan group including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas has been negotiating a college sports reform bill for months, but those talks are moving more slowly than Cruz had hoped at the beginning of this Congress.",
      "The draft bill in the House would create a national standard for NIL, overriding the state laws that critics say have led to a chaotic recruiting environment. That, too, was criticized by Democrats and by their key witness at the hearing, Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association.",
      "Huma argued that the NCAA wants to get rid of booster-funded NIL collectives that another witness, Southeastern Conference associate commissioner William King, characterized as \u201cfake NIL\u201d or \u201cpay for play.\u201d",
      "Instead, Huma said the collectives are examples of the free market at work, noting that before players won NIL rights through a court case, boosters could only donate to athletic departments.",
      "Tom McMillen, a former Democratic congressman who played in the NBA after an All-America basketball career at Maryland, took a dim view of the bill's prospects.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to come up with something and pull in some Democrats. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to succeed or not,\u201d said McMillen, who for several years led an association of Division I athletic directors. \u201cThere's a real philosophical divide, so that's the hard part. It's hard to bridge. And there's a zillion other issues.\u201d",
      "The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., said the draft legislation already had some bipartisan support and he was open to changes that would get more Democrats on board.",
      "\u201cI will consider some of the suggestions, the legitimate suggestions that were made,\u201d Bilirakis said, \u201cand I will be happy to talk to lawmakers that truly want to get a big bill across the finish line.\u201d",

      "Suarez has faced adversity before, but never like the pressure he's feeling hoping to deliver in front of the local crowd. This weekend in Mexico is special to Suarez, who expects well over 100 of the spectators in attendance Sunday to be friends and family.",
      "They've watched from afar as he's worked his way into the NASCAR spotlight, a journey full of ups and downs that have seen Suarez drive for four different Cup teams. He joined Trackhouse Racing in 2021 and last year signed a one-year extension through 2025.",
      "At the time, he said he wanted to reassess where the program was before signing a long-term deal. But it's been a disappointing start to the season and his average finish of 21st is three spots worse than last year.",
      "\u201cThe Mexico race is something that I\u2019ve been hoping and waiting on for many, many years, and I\u2019m not going to let anything else from outside take that week and that moment from myself,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe have to just continue to put one foot in front of the other and continue to move forward. I think that in Trackhouse, we have found some decent speed in the last few weeks, so that\u2019s promising, and hopefully we can continue to move in that direction.\u201d",
      "Suarez will have Mexican communication company Telcel on his car this weekend.",
      "\u201cFor many years, I never had a sponsor deal with a company from Mexico because I wasn\u2019t racing there,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cSo right now that we\u2019re going to be having an event down there, it opens a whole new world of opportunities and that\u2019s great, obviously for me, but for the entire sport.\u201d",
      "It's another layer of pressure for Suarez, who wants nothing more than to balance the demands of being the star of Sunday's show with delivering a strong showing.",
      "\"Once we get into the race, we don\u2019t want to deal with any of this stuff, and I just want to focus and have fun driving race cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be more on my plate just by nature, just being the local guy, the very first race ever in Mexico City in the Cup Series. I have to accept that. With that being said, I have to protect my space for the competition stuff because if we don\u2019t do the competition stuff right, everything else doesn\u2019t really matter. So we have to put a balance on everything.\u201d",
      "As Suarez noted, a win on Sunday would dramatically improve his hopes of remaining with Trackhouse on a contract extension. It could happen: Suarez's first Cup victory came on the road course at Sonoma, and the next five Cup races include road-course races at Mexico City, Sonoma and the Chicago street course.",
      "He admitted \u201chonestly, I don't know\u201d about what he'd like out of a contract extension, but said he speaks regularly with team owner Justin Marks.",
      "\u201cThe trajectory of Trackhouse has been tremendous,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cWe have learned so many things. I really want to help Justin bring Trackhouse to the next level. I believe that 2022 has been our best year as a company, still. So why is that? Are we missing something? Do we have to change something? What do we need to do better? As a new team, to have your best years that early, it\u2019s kind of uncommon. One of the reasons, I believe, was because of the new car. So I believe that we have to continue to grow.",
      "\u201cRoss just won a race a couple weeks ago, and that\u2019s brought a lot of energy to the team and some more momentum. Before that, it was a little bit of a struggle. So we have to continue to find that speed in a consistent basis, just like the big teams,\" he continued. \"So we\u2019re having all these conversations. I wish I didn\u2019t have to have these conversations, and I didn\u2019t have these distractions, but it\u2019s part of life, right? Sometimes you have to do several things at the same time. But I\u2019m trying not to think about it too much and trying to work in my job and push as hard as possible for competition and trying to help the team slowly get better and better.\u201d",

      "The toughest test in golf is underway at the course reputed to be the toughest in America",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- The first shot of the 125th U.S. Open on Thursday embodied so much of what this championship is about. Matt Vogt, an Indiana dentist who went through 54 holes of qualifying, sent his tee shot soaring into the rough at Oakmont.",
      "Vogt, who once caddied at Oakmont before moving on to root canals, managed to use the severe slope of the first fairway for his ball to tumble onto the green for a par.",
      "There are high expectations everywhere at the major known as the toughest test in golf \u2014 for Scottie Scheffler, the world No. 1; for Bryson DeChambeau, the defending champion; and for everyone to face an Oakmont course reputed to be the toughest in the land.",
      "\u201cOakmont is relentless,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the chief championships officer at the USGA who sets up the course. \u201cThere\u2019s no let up. It\u2019s a grind. That\u2019s the U.S. Open.\u201d",
      "The USGA is particularly fond of Oakmont, a big reason why the U.S. Open returns to his course for a record 10th time.",
      "It has been on the minds of all 156 players \u2014 from Scheffler and Masters champion Rory McIlroy to the 15 amateurs, and for the 16 players, like Vogt, who had to make it through 18 holes of local qualifying and then 36 holes.",
      "Zac Blair had the first birdie of this championship, holing a putt from nearly 45 feet on the 10th hole after starting his round on the back nine.",
      "Alistair Docherty suffered the first of what figures to be plenty of crashes. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole.",
      "That's what Oakmont does \u2014 thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. The USGA pointed out on the eve of the championship that only 27 of the 1,385 players who have competed in a major championship at Oakmont finished under par.",

      "\u201cWe want to finish the season in style with the cherry on the cake,\u201d coach Luis Enrique said.",
      "PSG had already qualified for the rebooted Club World Cup in the United States, but its Champions League triumph may still have come as a relief to FIFA.",
      "That's because, while the winner of the bumper tournament will officially be crowned the best club soccer team in the world, there are some notable absentees from the 32-team roster.",
      "The Club World Cup will be without the champion of the most popular league in the world \u2014 the Premier League \u2014 given Liverpool's failure to meet the qualifying criteria.",
      "The same goes for Barcelona and Napoli -- champions of Spain and Italy, respectively.",
      "No place either for current Asian champion Al-Ahli from Saudi Arabia or Pyramids \u2014 the African champion from Egypt.",
      "FIFA likely breathed a sigh of relief then when PSG and Inter Milan advanced to the final of the Champions League, with both teams having already secured their place at the Club World Cup via ranking points for recent runs in Europe's top club competition. Had either of the losing semifinalists \u2014 Barcelona or Arsenal \u2014 gone on to lift the trophy, then the flagship new tournament would have been without the reigning champion of Europe as well.",
      "The qualifying criteria were based on winners of continental trophies in the four years prior to the tournament, but not including the season directly before it.",
      "That's why Chelsea \u2014 Champions League winner in 2021 \u2014 has a seat at the table despite finishing fourth in the Premier League last month. Chelsea is arriving at the Club World Cup with a new team, coach and even owners since it won the Champions League four years ago.",
      "The club is one of 12 from Europe, including stellar names like Real Madrid, PSG, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Inter and Juventus.",
      "Some of Latin America's biggest teams are in the tournament \u2014 including reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo from Brazil. Three other Brazilian teams have qualified: Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense.",
      "Argentina's famous rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors will also be there \u2014 and are expected to be backed by thousands of fans traveling to the U.S.",
      "It is the Latin American contingent that likely will likely present the biggest challenge to the European teams.",
      "\u201cEveryone wants to compete \u2014 the question is how you prepare to win, to try to win. That\u2019s what challenges me,\u201d said Marcelo Gallardo, River Plate head coach. \u201cI want to win. I don\u2019t want to just go and see what happens.\u201d",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the tournament is what the sport has been waiting for \u2014 a world championship for club soccer.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the 32 best clubs in the world will compete in a tournament to determine finally who is the best club in the world,\u201d he said this week.",
      "In its previous format, which involved a mini-tournament of just seven teams instead of 32, it never fully captured global interest. Played in the middle of the season for Europe\u2019s top leagues, it had the feel of an exhibition, rather than a serious tournament. European teams dominated the modern era, winning all but one of the last 17 editions.",
      "The new format will be a much more exacting examination of the eventual winner \u2014 not least because there are so many teams from Europe, but also because there has been a marked drive to improve levels in countries like the U.S. and Saudi Arabia following a slew of star signings such as Lionel Messi, who has transformed Inter Miami.",
      "However, it remains unclear how much of an appetite there is among fans for another elite tournament in a calendar that is already saturated.",
      "Details on ticket sales have not been released, but prices have dropped as the tournament has drawn closer and seats for the opening game between Al Ahly and Inter Miami on Saturday were still available this week.",
      "Marriott Bonvoy, a U.S. Soccer Federation partner, has been offering free tickets to some of its elite members for some games.",
      "It also remains to be seen what the television viewing figures will be, with the tournament broadcast globally on streaming service DAZN, which has also made 24 matches available with English-language commentary to TNT in the U.S.",
      "Al Ahly vs. Inter Miami, June 14, Miami",
      "Five years after its MLS debut, Inter Miami \u2014 the team owned by David Beckham \u2014 will kick off in the first game of the Club World Cup. Its opponent in the opener is Egypt's Al Ahly \u2014 the winner of a record 12 African championships. It's likely to be party time at the Hard Rock Stadium, but the chance of Al Ahly spoiling Miami's big day is very real.",
      "PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, June 15, Los Angeles",
      "It will be an early test for PSG against Atletico. This is the type of match that could grace the later stages of any Champions League campaign between two of Europe's finest.",

      "LAFC got in through the back door via a playoff against Club America of Mexico and its reward is an opening game against two-time Champions League winner Chelsea.",
      "Real Madrid vs. Al-Hilal, June 18, Miami",
      "The anticipation around this one would have been so much more intense had Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal not released Neymar in January, but it still has other star signings like striker Aleksandar Mitrovic. Madrid has a new coach in Xabi Alonso, who can get off to a flying start by winning the world title.",

      "\u201cI feel like every game\u2019s so big during this time,\" center Anton Lundell said Wednesday. \u201cThe stakes gets higher. Everybody wants to win. But we both know for both teams it\u2019s a big game, and we want to be good.\u201d",

That\u2019s a dangerous combination. We have to make sure that we bring our best.\u201d",

The Oilers are missing Zach Hyman because of his playoff-ending wrist injury, and fellow top-line forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is dealing with something that is keeping him off the ice for practices and making him a game-time decision.",
      "That discrepancy could make a difference in their Cup final rematch. One thing that is the same is Florida locking in and normalizing pressure situations like this.",
      "\u201cOur approach, it\u2019s pretty similar the entire playoffs,\" said Bennett, who leads all scorers this postseason with 14 goals. \"Whether it\u2019s Game 1 or Game 7, we play the same style.

      "BOSTON -- Red Sox rookie Hunter Dobbins made some headlines prior to his first career start against the Yankees last week when he said he'd rather retire than pitch for New York.",
      "Now he's explaining why the claims he made about his father once playing in the minors for Boston's longtime rival aren't the intentional fabrication a New York Post report says they were.",
      "Hunter Dobbins said Wednesday he was made aware of the Post story, but said there is nothing nefarious about the connections he said his father had to the Yankees.",
      "\u201cMy feelings and all that are based on my personal experiences and nothing to do with growing up or family,\u201d Dobbins said. \u201cThe whole backstory is stuff I heard growing up and seen pictures of from my dad. At the end of my day it\u2019s just from my dad and how I kind of grew my love for the game. But at the end of the day I don\u2019t go and fact-check my dad or anything like that.\u201d",
      "In a June 7 Boston Herald feature on Dobbins that ran the day before he allowed three runs and four hits in five innings of an 11-7 win over the Yankees, he said that his father, Lance Dobbins, had been drafted twice by the Yankees before being traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks. The story also makes reference to Dobbins saying his father was friends with Andy Pettitte, who played 15 major league seasons with New York.",
      "But the Post report found no evidence of any of that, citing multiple official databases and the Yankees' own records that couldn't substantiate Lance Dobbins having played with the organization. Lance Dobbins' own profile on Baseball-Reference.com doesn't list any Yankees affiliation. The 2025 Red Sox Media Guide does mention him on Hunter Dobbins' biography page, but says only that Lance \"pitched for 2 seasons (1996-97) in the Diamondbacks organization.\u201d",
      "Dobbins, who is scheduled to pitch again against the Yankees on Saturday at Fenway Park, said he has since spoken to his father \u201ca little, but not really\u201d about the Post story that first noted the discrepancies.",
      "\u201cMy whole focus is on Saturday and getting ready to face the Yankees,\" Hunter Dobbins said. \"This is my first time in the big leagues facing a team for a second time, let alone back-to-back. So that's where my focus is 100%. I imagine we'll talk in the future or something like that. But it's been a bigger deal than it ever really needed to be. But at the end of the day I really just need to get ready to go for Saturday\u201d",
      "The 25-year-old is 3-1 with a 4.20 ERA this season.",
      "He said he isn't surprised the story has gotten the attention it has in recent days.",
      "\u201cThis is a great rivalry,\" Dobbins said. \"Two cities that have a long history together. Anything that's kind of in the news that goes with both of them, that's going to turn into a story. It adds to the game and we just have to embrace it and keep rolling.\u201d",

      "Eight female athletes have filed an appeal of a landmark NCAA antitrust settlement",
      "Eight female athletes filed an appeal Wednesday of a landmark NCAA antitrust settlement, arguing that women would not receive their fair share of $2.7 billion in back pay for athletes who were barred from making money off their name, image and likeness.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the settlement last week, clearing the way for direct payments from universities to athletes and the end of the NCAA's amateurism model.",
      "The athletes who appealed the settlement competed in soccer, volleyball and track. They are Kacie Breeding of Vanderbilt; Lexi Drumm, Emma Appleman, Emmie Wannemacher, Riley Hass, Savannah Baron and Elizabeth Arnold of the College of Charleston; and Kate Johnson of Virginia. They have standing to appeal because they previously filed objections to the proposed settlement.",
      "Ashlyn Hare, one of the attorneys representing the athletes, said in a statement that the settlement violates Title IX, the federal law that bans sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cWe support a settlement of the case, but not an inaccurate one that violates federal law. The calculation of past damages is based on an error that ignores Title IX and deprives female athletes of $1.1 billion,\u201d Hare said. \u201cPaying out the money as proposed would be a massive error that would cause irreparable harm to women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "The law firm representing the plaintiffs in the settlement issued a statement saying the appeal would delay payments to hundreds of thousands of athletes by a minimum of several months.",
      "\u201cThese attorneys are pursuing an appeal based on a Title IX issue that Judge Wilken already disposed of correctly, quickly and multiple times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The House settlement figures to financially benefit football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, who are likely to receive a big chunk of the $20.5 million per year that colleges are permitted to share with athletes over the next year. Some athletes in other sports that don't make money for their schools could lose their partial scholarships or see their roster spots cut.",
      "\u201cThis is a football and basketball damages settlement with no real benefit to female athletes,\u201d Hare said. \u201cCongress has expressly rejected efforts to exempt revenue-generating sports like football and basketball from Title IX\u2019s antidiscrimination mandate. The NCAA agreed with us. Our argument on appeal is the exact same argument the conferences and NCAA made prior to settling the case.\u201d",
      "The appeal was filed by the law firm Hutchinson Black and Cook of Boulder, Colorado, and was first reported by Front Office Sports. It would be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that internally as a group,\" Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. \"The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build.\u201d",
      "Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.",
      "\u201cWhether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (Am\u00e9rica), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn\u2019t going to miss competitions,\u201d Dempsey said last week on the \u201cMen in Blazers\u201d podcast. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t understand it because that wasn\u2019t my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games.\u201d",

I think we\u2019re on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we\u2019ve been training. It\u2019ll take a little bit of time, but it will come together.\u201d",
      "Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "\u201cA little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything \u2014 overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp,\u201d Adams said. \u201cProgressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.\u201d",
      "Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cBefore the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.\u201d",
      "Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely enjoyable when you\u2019re healthy,\u201d he said. \"The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.\"",
      "Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.",
      "\u201cFrom a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMaurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they\u2019re comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there\u2019s still structure to the way that we want to play.\u201d",
      "Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons.",
      "\u201cAfter you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what game I play in now the game feels slow. You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don\u2019t, you get punished.\"",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "The award winners are researching a vast array of topics, from the notebook of Isaac Newton\u2019s roommate to the history and culture of Ethiopian Jews. The academics recently received the prize during a ceremony in Italy.",
      "The prize, based at Tel Aviv University, is awarded each year to academics in the early and middle stages of their careers who are conducting \u201cinnovative research on the human past.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy making groundbreaking discoveries or applying new methods to historical research, our winners constantly challenge us to think about the past while rethinking how we shed light on it,\u201d said Ariel David, whose father, Dan David, founded the prize in 2001.",
      "One of the winners is Beth Lew-Williams of Princeton University, a historian whose work has focused on how legal discrimination impacted Chinese immigration to the US and the experience of Chinese immigrants.",
      "Another is Fred Kudjo Kuwornu of Do The Right Films, a filmmaker whose work focuses on Black representation and identity. His recent film, We Were Here: The Untold History of Black Africans in Renaissance Europe, was presented at the 2024 Biennale in Venice.",
      "Another awardee is Dmitri Levitin of the University of Utrecht and All Souls College, Oxford, a history of scholarship who is collaborating on research into the newly discovered notebook of Isaac Newton\u2019s university roommate.",

      "Czech President Petr Pavel has sworn in a new justice minister amid a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal",
      "PRAGUE -- Czech President Petr Pavel swore in a new justice minister on Tuesday, another step in a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. The new minister is from the same party.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "\u201cThe public trust in the institutions and the state is at stake,\u201d Pavel said.",
      "The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated.",
      "The opposition parties demand the resignation of the entire government and are planning to request a parliamentary no-confidence vote. It could take place later in June.",
      "The issue has been investigated by the national police's organized crime unit.",
      "The scandal is taking place just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. The main opposition ANO (YES) party led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 is predicted to win the vote.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",

Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021.

      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",

      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",

But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",

      "A Chinese scientist has been arrested while arriving in the U.S. in Detroit",
      "DETROIT -- A Chinese scientist was arrested while arriving in the U.S. at the Detroit airport, the second case in days involving the alleged smuggling of biological material, authorities said Monday.",
      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The scientist was interviewed and arrested Sunday after arriving on a flight from China, where she is pursuing an advanced degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. She planned to spend a year completing a project at the University of Michigan.",
      "Her shipments, including an envelope stuffed inside a book, were intercepted last year and earlier this year and opened by authorities, the FBI said.",
      "The court filing doesn't indicate whether the FBI believes the biological material was risky, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said smuggling \"threatens our security.\"",
      "The scientist remains in custody awaiting a bond hearing Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material,\u201d said Michael Shapira, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who read the court filing and spoke to The Associated Press.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",

      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms.

      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards.

    "summary": "The Senate has been signaling changes to the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" are coming, and as Congress barrels toward its deadline, those changes are taking shape.",
    "story": [
      "Congress faces a July 4 deadline to pass the megabill.",
      "The Senate has long been signaling that changes to the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" are coming, and as Congress barrels toward President Donald Trump's July 4 deadline, the contours of those changes are beginning to take shape.",
      "Senators met for over two hours on Wednesday to hear updates from committee chairs about proposed changes to certain portions of the House-approved package. Very few details are locked in, but senators received an overview of the general direction the provisions in the bill are taking.",
      "\"Imagine a jigsaw puzzle with 3,000 pieces and no picture. So that's what we're trying to put together,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the bill would rein in the cost of government and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path to a degree \"I think a lot of people never thought was possible.\"",
      "\"This will be the biggest spending reduction, mandatory spending, in history, so we are working to that end,\" Thune said on \"The Will Cain Show.\"",
      "Here's a look at how some of the major provisions of this bill are taking shape.",
      "SNAP",
      "Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., the chairman of the Senate agriculture committee, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, signaled there would be changes in the bill to lessen the burden on the states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal.",
      "Boozman said that unlike the House bill that would require states to share 5% of the cost of SNAP, the Senate proposal does away with the cost-share, though states with high error rates would still have an obligation to share costs.",
      "Work requirements for families of young children to qualify for SNAP would also change, now being implemented for families with children over 10 instead of children over 7.",
      "The changes to the House proposal would mean that the savings from SNAP changes implemented in the bill are about $20 billion less than the House's version, per Boozman.",
      "SALT",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave House centrists a win by upping the cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000. Senators left Wednesday's meeting suggesting they plan to lower that cap.",
      "The Senate has not coalesced around a new cap, but senators have signaled the number will be well beneath $40,000.",
      "\"There was never a number specially discussed other than that the House is 40, and it's a lot. No surprise that there's an interest in reducing it,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.",
      "\"It's likely we will do less, and that's how specific it got,\" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., echoed.",
      "From the Senate GOP's calculus, lowering the SALT cap is an easy win since it helps to cut costs from the bill and there are virtually no Senate Republicans from blue states with especially high state and local taxes.",
      "But slashing the SALT cap could make for a perilous path forward in the House, where a number of centrist Republicans have threatened to withhold support if the Senate touches the cap.",
      "\"There isn't much interest in the Senate in going back on SALT,\" Thune said during a Fox News interview. \"Having said that, they need the votes in the House. We understand that, and we are looking at ways that we can adjust and dial those provisions.\"",
      "Border funding",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is one of the Senate's biggest fiscal hawks and, as such, one of the bill's biggest naysayers. He's also the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and responsible for charting a path forward on the border provisions in the package.",
      "Paul told reporters he advocated lowering the amount of money allocated for border security.",
      "\"I presented my ideas that we shouldn't immediately accept the $150 billion for border security, that we should look at how much a wall costs to build,\" Paul said.",
      "Paul said a number of his colleagues came along to his way of thinking but that he didn't win over everyone in the room.",
      "\"Maybe we can find some savings there, but Sen. Paul's numbers are just not realistic,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Medicaid",
      "Medicaid changes remain somewhat of an open question.",
      "Thune said he is \"working on\" getting Republicans on the same page about Medicaid cuts, especially with members such as Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Ark., who made the issue their line in the sand when it comes to supporting the bill.",
      "\"The House made a good effort, trying to pare back the use of provider taxes and the way they have been gamed and used in the past,\" Thune said, suggesting that provider tax credits have been manipulated by residents of blue states.",
      "\"And the Senate is trying to build upon that, but obviously it is an issue that we need to have 51 votes for in the Senate, they need to keep 418 in the House,\" he said, suggesting the Senate could step over Hawley's stipulations. \"At the end of the day, this is a program that is right for reform.",
      "\"The things we are going to do are going to strengthen it and improve it and make it available for whom it was intended,\" Thune concluded. \"It shouldn't be available for illegal immigrants. There are people who are ineligible, able-bodied males, who are working age -- there ought to be a work requirement attached to it.\"",
      "Energy tax credits",
      "Multiple senators have signaled they plan to toy with transferability of expiration dates of certain Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits.",
      "\"There are certain newer tools where businesses have made large capital investments where we hopefully can extend the runway or the landing strip a little bit for them,\" Cramer said. \"It comes down to things, like when the credit kicks in versus when it runs out, when it expires.\"",

      "A massive military parade is set to bring thousands to Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th birthday on June 14 -- the same day as President Donald Trump's 79th birthday.",
      "The Army has estimated more than 6,000 soldiers will participate in the event -- an all-day ordeal that's expected to include a fitness competition, festival and parade complete with tanks and infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers and parachute jumps.",
      "\"We will celebrate a spectacular military parade in Washington, D.C., like no other,\" Trump said on his social media site last week, touting a parade that's \"gonna be better and bigger than any parade we've ever had in this country.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the event:",
      "When is the military parade?",
      "The parade is on June 14 at 6:30 p.m. -- and is a part of a day of events that goes from 8:30 a.m. until around 10 p.m.",
      "The day begins with Army senior leaders laying a wreath on Tomb of the Unknown at Arlington National Cemetery. After that, a fitness competition will go from 9:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m.",
      "Then a festival -- open to the public -- will take place on the National Mall from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m.",
      "After the parade, there will be a fireworks show over the Tidal Basin at 9:45 p.m.",
      "The festival and the parade are free events that are open to the public. Tickets are not required.",
      "What is the parade route?",
      "The parade route will follow along D.C.'s Constitution Avenue from 23rd to 15th streets and end near the White House, where parachutists with the Army's Golden Knights will jump on to the Ellipse and offer the president a folded flag.",
      "The Army is estimating some 200,000 people will be along the parade route.",
      "What will spectators see in the military parade?",
      "The parade includes 6,700 soldiers, 28 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley Fighter Vehicles, 28 Stryker vehicles, four Paladin self-propelled howitzers, eight marching bands, 24 horses, two mules and one dog named Doc Holiday, according to the Army. The Army has also added rocket launchers and precision-guided missiles to its birthday show.",
      "There will also be 50 aircraft flying overhead -- including World War II-era platforms like the M4 Sherman tank, the Douglas C-47 transport aircraft and the P-51 Mustang fighter. There will be Cobra and Huey helicopters too, according to the Army.",
      "Members from every Army division are participating in the parade -- with a vision of telling the history of the Army. The parade will have troops dressed in Revolutionary War garb and then move through the various wars in history, the Army said. As the troops and equipment march through D.C., any aircraft corresponding to that era will fly overhead.",
      "What is the expected cost of the parade?",
      "The Army said it expects to spend anywhere from $25 million to $45 million on this year's events, although the final tally is expected to be much higher when other costs are factored in.",
      "The U.S. Secret Service has designated the event a \"national security special event\" akin to the Super Bowl or a presidential inauguration, requiring significant security resources.",
      "The Department of Homeland Secretary has not released a cost estimate for securing the event.",
      "The Army also will be on the hook for any damage done to roads in Maryland and Washington.",
      "Are any protests expected?",
      "Progressive groups say they'll hold more than 1,500 \"No Kings Day\" events across the U.S. on Saturday to protest the Trump administration and to counter the military parade.",
      "The Women's March is planning its own protests with events set for around the country.",
      "When was the last U.S. military parade?",
      "On June 8, 1991, the US Park Police estimated 800,000 people crammed on to the National Mall to celebrate the U.S. victory in the Persian Gulf War -- with 200,000 people lining the parade route.",
      "At the time, ABC News reported the cost at $12 million, with $5 million of the cost covered by private donations.",

    "story": [
      "A family's case could proceed under an exception to law enforcement immunity.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said innocent victims of wrong-house raids and other abuses by federal law enforcement can seek compensation for emotional and physical harms, upholding a key exception to sweeping legal immunity that has long protected the government from being sued.",
      "The Court's decision resuscitates a lawsuit brought by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, traumatizing Martin's then 7-year-old son and incurring $5000 of damage from burned carpet, broken doors, and fractured railings.",
      "Agents quickly acknowledged they had stormed the wrong address due to a faulty GPS direction, but the FBI refused to provide any restitution. Lower courts later tossed out the family's liability claims, citing sweeping protections under federal law.",
      "In a unanimous decision, the high court said the Martin case could move forward but stopped short of rendering judgment on whether the FBI could successfully invoke other legal defenses related to the discretionary nature of its job.",
      "\"If federal officers raid the wrong house, causing property damage and assaulting innocent occupants, may the homeowners sue the government for damages? The answer is not as obvious as it might be,\" wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Court's opinion.",
      "\"All agree that the Federal Tort Claims Act permits some suits for wrong-house raids. But the scope of the Act's permission is much less clear,\" he said.",
      "Gorsuch confirmed that Congress has unambiguously opened the door to potential liability when an officer commits an \"assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process.\" He remanded the case to a lower court for further consideration as to whether the FBI could invoke other protections.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for us but also for everyone who is fighting for accountability and justice,\u201d Trina Martin said in a statement. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, but we look forward to continuing the fight. What happened to us was wrong and should never happen to anyone. I\u2019ve been praying constantly about our case, and it is amazing to have those prayers be heard.\u201d",
      "While there is no reliable nationwide data, civil rights advocates say there are likely hundreds of cases of wrong-house raids by U.S. law enforcement every year, sometimes resulting from faulty intelligence or inadvertent human or technological error.",
      "Legal immunity for cops often means little restitution for victims.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the Martin case be tossed out because officers exercising discretion in the course of their duties should not face the threat of lawsuits and second-guessed by courts.",
      "\u201cToday the Supreme Court confirmed that victims of federal abuse have a powerful tool to seek accountability,\u201d said Patrick Jaicomo, senior counsel with Institute for Justice, which represented the Atlanta family.",
      "There was no immediate reaction to the decision from the Department of Justice.",
      "The ruling comes as advocates for victims of police misconduct and mistakes say President Donald Trump is rolling back guardrails on law enforcement.",
      "The Trump Justice Department has put a freeze on federal civil rights investigations into cops and cancelled conset degrees with police departments found to have engaged in a patter of misconduct.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, urged the lower court in the Martin case to be critical of the administration's assertions of immunity for officers' discretionary actions in the line of duty.",
      "She said courts should not ignore lawmakers' intent in carving out an exception to blanket immunity under federal law. \"Any interpretation should alow for liability in the very cases Congress amended the [Federal Tort Claims Act] to remedy,\" Sotomayor wrote.",

      "Bonta argued in the filing that Trump failed to meet the legal requirements for such a federal deployment.",
      "\"To put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles; there is civil unrest that is no different from episodes that regularly occur in communities throughout the country, and that is capable of being contained by state and local authorities working together,\" Bonta wrote.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer declined California's request to issue a temporary restraining order immediately and instead set the hearing for Thursday afternoon in San Francisco and gave the Trump administration the time they requested to file a response.",
      "In their response, Department of Justice lawyers asked the judge to deny Newsom's request for a temporary restraining order that would limit the military to protecting federal buildings, arguing such an order would amount to a \"rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law.\"",

      "Some 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area following protests over immigration raids. California leaders claim Trump inflamed the protests by sending in the military when it was not necessary.",
      "Protests have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.",
      "Trump on Tuesday defended his decision to send in the National Guard and Marines, saying the situation in LA was \"out of control.\"",
      "\"All I want is safety. I just want a safe area,\" he told reporters. \"Los Angeles was under siege until we got there. The police were unable to handle it.\"",
      "Trump went on to suggest that he sent in the National Guard and the Marines to send a message to other cities not to interfere with ICE operations or they will be met with equal or greater force.",
      "\"If we didn't attack this one very strongly, you'd have them all over the country,\" he said. \"But I can inform the rest of the country that when they do it, if they do it, they're going to be met with equal or greater force than we met right here.\"",

      "A first hearing on some of these issues is set for Thursday as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, challenges the federal deployment and seeks emergency relief.",
      "How Trump mobilized the troops",
      "To send thousands of National Guardsmen to Los Angeles, Trump invoked Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code.",
      "The statute allows the president to call on federal service members when there \"is a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "In his order, Trump said the troops would protect federal property and federal personnel who are performing their functions.",
      "Trump, however, did not invoke the Insurrection Act -- a clear exception to the mandates of the Posse Comitatus Act, the law that limits the military from being involved in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"Instead, he's using authorities in a very novel way,\" Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center, said on ABC News Live.",
      "Goitein noted how broad Trump's memorandum is in nature, saying it\u2019s not limited to Los Angeles and allows for troops to be sent anywhere protests \"are likely to occur.\"",
      "\"This is a preemptive, nationwide, potentially, deployment of the federal military to effectively police protests. It is unheard of in this country,\" Goitein said.",
      "California seeks emergency relief",

      "Newsom argues the situation, which has been relatively confined to a few square blocks in downtown Los Angeles, doesn't justify the use of Section 12406 in Title 10.",
      "\"To put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles; there is civil unrest that is no different from episodes that regularly occur in communities throughout the country, and that is capable of being contained by state and local authorities working together. And nothing is stopping the President from enforcing the laws through use of ordinary, civilian mechanisms available to federal officers,\" the state contended in an emergency motion.",
      "The state's lawsuit also lambasts Trump for bypassing the governor and local leaders who objected to the mobilization of the National Guard and active duty Marines.",
      "However, some legal experts say Section 12406 in Title 10 does not on its face require a request from the governor. There is also precedent for the president sending in the National Guard without governor support: in 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the National Guard to deal with civil unrest in the South without cooperation from state leaders.",
      "Immigration raids raise more questions",
      "\"If this ultimately gets to the Supreme Court, I don't think they're going to find that the president unlawfully federalized the National Guard troops,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and a former active duty judge advocate in the U.S. Air Force.",

      "National Guard members joining ICE on raids marks a significant escalation, she said.",
      "\"It's getting dangerously close to law enforcement,\" VanLandingham said.",
      "California made that argument in its emergency motion.",

    "summary": "The hearing comes amid immigration enforcement protests in California.",
    "story": [
      "Hochul said Trump's actions \"undermine sovereignty of individual states.\"",
      "The high-profile Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota and New York are defending their states' immigration policies in a Republican-led House Oversight Committee on Thursday -- weighing in on the ongoing Los Angeles protests over immigration enforcement.",
      "JB Pritzker of Illinois, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Kathy Hochul of New York are taking questions from the House panel -- many dealing with their policies as so-called \"sanctuary states.\" Their testimony comes as another Democratic-led state -- California -- is grappling with a slew of immigration-related protests that triggered President Donald Trump to deploy U.S. Marines and the National Guard to the area.",
      "Sanctuary states still enforce U.S. federal immigration laws, but the term often refers to a limited collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while enacting policies that are more favorable to undocumented people.",
      "'An overreach of epic proportions'",
      "The governors slammed Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with Hochul saying the actions \"undermine sovereignty of individual states.\"",
      "\"Governors are the commanders in chief of the National Guard. They know what to do, as you've heard from my colleagues, we have deployed them on a number of occasions. But confidence in local law enforcement -- you're basically saying that there's not a belief that the highly trained individuals of our municipal police departments like Los Angeles and the city of New York ... can handle [their] jobs,\" Hochul said, adding it's \"an overreach of epic proportions.\"",
      "Pritzker added that the decision goes against typical protocol, which \"tends to have an inflaming effect.\" And Walz said it is important that governors and the federal government to coordinate -- especially when dealing with the National Guard.",
      "\"The absolute pinnacle and the most critical piece is, is the coordination amongst them. As a governor, not being notified as local law enforcement, it creates a chaotic situation that they cannot operate as a joint unit,\" Walz said.",
      "The hearing kicked off with a fiery statement from Ranking Member Stephen Lynch attacking Trump and his administration for their immigration policies. Referencing the Los Angeles protests, Lynch said deploying the military against civilians is \"wrong.\"",
      "\"I'm proud of my Democratic colleagues who are willing to stand up to this thuggery. Trump is a wannabe gangster, and he's showing the world what he's about,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said.",
      "Stefanik, Jordan face off with Hochul",
      "Republicans on the House panel repeatedly pointed to specific incidents in each of the governor's states about U.S. citizens getting injured or killed at the hands of undocumented people.",
      "New York Rep. Elise Stefanik fired off at Hochul first about individual cases of violence in New York at the hands of immigrants, repeatedly highlighting crime in \"Kathy Hochul's New York.\" Later in the hearing, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan engaged in similar questioning with the New York governor.",
      "\"These are horrific crimes, crimes that are committed on your watch,\" Stefanik said, later adding that the governor was \"prioritizing your far left sanctuary state policies\" -- a statement Hochul denied.",
      "Governors insist immigration is job for Congress",
      "Republicans on the Committee accused the governors of overseeing a rise in crime and blocking law enforcement and ICE's actions.",
      "\"I invited these governors here today because as the chief executives of their states, they willfully ignore a federal law, shield illegal aliens and pass the cost of free services onto their hard working taxpayers,\" House Oversight Chair James Comer said.",
      "The governors fired back, saying immigration in the country is managed by the federal government.",
      "\"While you've convened this hearing to explore the issue of so-called 'sanctuary states.' Minnesota is not even a sanctuary state. Minnesota legislature has passed no such bill making Minnesota sanctuary state, and I have signed no such law. Minnesota cooperates with federal authorities in a number of ways,\" Walz said.",
      "\"But enforcing immigration law is not the role of local and state governments. The fact is, Congress has given federal agencies the authority to enforce immigration laws across this country that includes Minnesota, and I support them doing. So it's the federal government's job to secure the border,\" Walz added.",
      "The governors also decried some of Trump's immigration platforms and recent moves, calling for \"compassionate\" policy.",
      "\"As I have consistently said, violent criminals have no place on our streets and if they are undocumented, I want them out of Illinois and out of our country,\" Pritzker said in his opening statement.",
      "In March, the Oversight Committee held another newsy hearing with \"sanctuary city\" mayors including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Those leaders defended their actions on immigration enforcement while Republicans on the committee accused them of increasing crime by defying Trump administration immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature passed a package of bills this week that were designed to aid in federal crackdowns on migrants suspected of entering the country illegally",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- As protests erupt across the country over aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, Louisiana lawmakers approved a package of legislation this week that'll aid the ongoing federal crackdown on deportation.",
      "Amid growing national tensions, Louisiana is the latest red state that expanded its immigration enforcement role \u2014 crafting a legislative promise to cooperate with federal agencies.",
      "Law enforcement agents and public officials could face jail time if they purposefully obstruct, delay or ignore federal immigration enforcement efforts, under one Louisiana bill. Another measure requires state agencies \u2014 including the departments of Health, Education, Corrections, Children & Family Services, and Motor Vehicles \u2014 to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services.",
      "The bills head to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a tough-on-crime conservative and staunch ally of President Donald Trump, who is likely to sign them into law.",
      "Following Trump's pledge to remove millions of people who are in the country illegally, immigration raids have ramped up from coast to coast. Federal agencies have sought to enlist state and local help, alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding them until federal agents take custody.",
      "Louisiana's GOP-dominated Legislature passed a bill to ensure just that.",
      "The measure expands the crime of malfeasance in office, which is punishable with up to 10 years in jail. Essentially, it would make it a crime for a public official or employee to refuse to comply with requests from agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also prohibits public officials, including police and judges, from knowingly releasing a person who \u201cillegally entered or unlawfully remained\u201d in the U.S. from their custody without providing advance notice to ICE.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those bills that says it\u2019s against the law not to enforce the law,\" said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris.",
      "Additionally, the bill expands the crime of obstruction of justice to include any act \u201cintended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts,\u201d including civil immigration proceedings.",
      "Tia Fields, an advocate for the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants, said she fears the measures will have a \u201cchilling effect\" and could potentially criminalize \u201cordinary acts of assistance or advice\u201d by advocates, religious leaders, attorneys or organizations.",
      "Louisiana, which does not share a border with a foreign country, is one of several states attempting to penalize local officials who don\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Most recently, under a new law in Tennessee, local officials who vote to adopt sanctuary policies could face up to six years in prison. Other states allow residents or the local attorney general to sue officials and state governments if they limit or refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "But threats of repercussions have gone beyond the creation of legislation. Most recently, as the National Guard was deployed to protests in Los Angeles, Tom Homan, the Trump administration's \u201c border czar,\" hinted that elected officials could face arrest if they interfere with agents on the ground.",
      "Amid growing tensions over immigration enforcement, Louisiana has made national headlines for its role.",
      "Nearly 7,000 people are being held in the state's nine immigration detention centers. Among them is Mahmoud Khalil, a student and legal U.S. resident whom the Trump administration jailed over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University.",
      "With a spotlight on Louisiana, bills and policies targeting migrants suspected of entering the country illegally were pushed to the forefront by Landry and legislators. Ranging from banning sanctuary city policies to sending Louisiana National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "One measure, passed this week, codifies an executive order of Landry. It requires state agencies to verify the citizenship of people attempting to receive or use state services and benefits. The agencies would collect and track such data, submitting an annual report to the governor, attorney general and Legislature, in addition to posting it publicly online.",
      "Any agency that does not comply risks having its funding withheld.",
      "Republican state Sen. Blake Miguez, who authored the legislation, said it was crafted so officials and residents know how much money and what \u201cservices or benefits have been afforded\u201d to immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "But another bill goes a step further \u2014 requiring state agencies to refer the applicant\u2019s information, \u201cincluding unsatisfactory immigration status,\u201d to ICE.",
      "State Sen. Royce Duplessis, a Democrat who opposed the bill, asked Miguez if the measure could result in families being separated.",
      "Miguez said that while that's \"a bit of a stretch,\u201d ultimately it is up to federal authorities and what they do with the information.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is appearing to acknowledge that the Pentagon has developed plans to take over Greenland and Panama by force if necessary",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge that the Pentagon has developed plans to take over Greenland and Panama by force if necessary but refused to answer repeated questions during a hotly combative congressional hearing Thursday about his use of Signal chats to discuss military operations.",
      "Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee repeatedly got into heated exchanges with Hegseth, with some of the toughest lines of questioning coming from military veterans as many demanded yes or no answers and he tried to avoid direct responses about his actions as Pentagon chief.",
      "In one back-and-forth, Hegseth did provide an eyebrow-raising answer. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., asked whether the Pentagon has plans to take Greenland or Panama by force if necessary.",
      "\u201cOur job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any contingency,\u201d Hegseth said several times.",
      "It is not unusual for the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for conflicts that have not arisen, but his handling of the questions prompted a Republican lawmaker to step in a few minutes later.",
      "\u201cIt is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\u201d said Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio.",
      "As Hegseth started to repeat his answer about contingency plans, Turner added emphatically, \u201cI sure as hell hope that is not your testimony.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\u201d Hegseth responded.",
      "Time and again, lawmakers pressed Hegseth to answer questions he has avoided for months, including during the two previous days of hearings on Capitol Hill. And frustration boiled over.",
      "\"You\u2019re an embarrassment to this country. You\u2019re unfit to lead,\" Rep. Salud Carbajal snapped, the California Democrat's voice rising. \u201cYou should just get the hell out.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's use of two Signal chats to discuss plans for U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen with other U.S. leaders as well as members of his family prompted dizzying exchanges with lawmakers.",
      "He was pressed multiple times over whether or not he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.",
      "Hegseth argued that the classification markings of any information about those military operations could not be discussed with lawmakers.",
      "That became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted \u2014 on strike times and munitions dropped in March \u2014 was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.",
      "\u201cYou can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,\u201d Moulton said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,\u201d Hegseth responded.",
      "A Pentagon watchdog report on his Signal use is expected soon.",
      "Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general finds that he placed classified information on Signal, a commercially available app.",
      "Hegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves \u201cat the pleasure of the president.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has said multiple times that he wants to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island nation of Greenland, long a U.S. ally. Those remarks have been met with flat rejections from Greenland's leaders.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland\u2019s representative to the U.S, said Thursday at a forum in Washington sponsored by the Arctic Institute.",
      "In an effort not to show the Pentagon's hand on its routine effort to have plans for everything, Hegseth danced around the direct question from Smith, leading to the confusion.",
      "\u201cSpeaking on behalf of the American people, I don\u2019t think the American people voted for President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland,\" Smith said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Mourners are paying their respects to former U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel as his body lies in state Thursday at New York City Hall, an honor bestowed to a short list of political figures, including U.S. presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "The outspoken, gravel-voiced Harlem Democrat died May 26 at a New York hospital. He was 94.",
      "Rangel spent nearly five decades on Capitol Hill and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
      "His funeral takes place Friday at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in midtown Manhattan. A wake was held Tuesday at a church in Harlem, the upper Manhattan neighborhood where Rangel, nicknamed the \u201cLion of Lenox Avenue,\u201d was born and raised.",
      "Rangel\u2019s body arrived at City Hall on Wednesday, where there was a private evening viewing for his family in the landmark neoclassical building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in lower Manhattan.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices rose modestly last month from a year earlier, another sign that inflationary pressures remain mild.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it its consumers \u2014 rose 2.6% in May 2024. Producer prices rose 0.1% from April to May after dropping 0.2% the month before.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, wholesale costs were up 0.1% from April and 3% from May 2024.",
      "The readings were slightly lower than economists had forecast.",
      "The report came out a day after the Labor Department said that consumer prices rose a modest 0.1% last month from April and 2.4% from a year earlier.",
      "Since returning to the office, Trump has rolled out 10% tariffs on nearly every country in the world as well as specific levies on steel, aluminum and autos. Importers in the United States pay the taxes and pass them along to consumers via higher prices when they can. For that reason, economists expect inflation to pick up later this year.",
      "So far, his tariffs don\u2019t seem to have had much of an impact on prices overall.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.",
      "But it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies. The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.",

      "Among those, the numbers of internally displaced people jumped by more than 9% to 73.5 million at the end of last year. The numbers represent cumulative figures from years of conflict, violence and persecution, and some displaced people returned home last year even as others fled.",

    "story": [
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid.",
      "The resolution, drafted by Spain and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, \u201cstrongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d",
      "Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Last week, the U.N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid. The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor.",
      "There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",
      "After a 10-week blockade that barred all aid to Gaza, Israel is allowing the United Nations to deliver a trickle of food assistance and is backing a newly created U.S. aid group, which has opened several sites in the center and south of the territory to deliver food parcels.",
      "But the aid system rolled out last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been troubled by near-daily shootings as crowds make their way to aid sites, while the longstanding U.N.-run system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order.",
      "The draft resolution being voted on Thursday references a March 28 legally binding order by the top United Nations court for Israel to open more land crossings into Gaza for food, water, fuel and other supplies. The International Court of Justice issued the order in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, charges Israel strongly denies.",
      "The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.",
      "It reiterates the assembly's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected.",
      "The resolution supports mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States aimed at implementing a January ceasefire agreement. When the U.S. vetoed last week\u2019s Gaza resolution, acting Ambassador Dorothy Shea said it would have undermined the security of Israel and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire \u201cthat reflects the realities on the ground.\u201d",
      "Like the failed Security Council resolution, the resolution to be voted on Thursday also does not condemn Hamas\u2019 deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza. Both are U.S. demands.",
      "The Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. About 55 hostages are still being held. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

    "story": [
      "House Democrats are searching for a new leader on the powerful House Oversight Committee after the untimely passing of their previous ranking member",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are quietly engaged in a behind-the-scenes race for a key committee position, the second time in as many months that the party has had to fill one of the most prized positions in Congress.",
      "Four Democrats are running to be the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, an investigative panel with public clout, subpoena power and an expansive portfolio. The position is open due to the death last month of Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia.",
      "While Democrats in the minority have little power to shape the committee\u2019s work, the ranking member position comes with an enormous platform \u2014 and the possibility of becoming chair if the party wins back the majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Whoever wins will immediately be squaring off against Republicans as they prepare for splashy hearings this summer on immigration enforcement, LGBTQ rights and former President Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental condition while in office.",
      "As they hear from the candidates, Democrats are weighing many of the factors that were in play late last year, when Connolly, a veteran member of the committee, fended off a challenge from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.",
      "A look at how the race is shaping up:",
      "The debate over Biden\u2019s age coincides with a reckoning over seniority and generational change happening across the Democratic Party.",
      "Four House Democrats are running for the position: Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, the acting ranking member; Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a viral sensation; Robert Garcia, a former Los Angeles County mayor who has pitched colleagues on a government reform agenda; and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, former president of the NAACP and civil rights advocate.",
      "While Lynch is the most senior of the four, Democrats broadly said they are more open to breaking from seniority than they were in December, when Connolly, then 74, beat out Ocasio-Cortez, 35, for the job.",
      "Democrats are interested in how the candidates would communicate with the public, how they would help support lawmakers in battleground districts \u2014 and of course, how they would challenge President Donald Trump and his administration.",
      "Crockett, 44, has pitched herself as the candidate best able to compete with Trump\u2019s pugnacious and attention-grabbing style. Democrats, Crockett has argued, often fail to connect with voters and explain why the president\u2019s actions may be harmful. She believes she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of bringing that in, having a hearing and making sure that we are translating it and amplifying it,\u201d Crockett told MSNBC in an interview. \u201cCommunications has to be a full-on strategy.\u201d",
      "Garcia, 47, has focused on government reform and effectiveness, a key issue for Democrats after the Trump administration\u2019s blitz across federal agencies and mass firings of federal workers by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Mfume, 76, has attracted support from members impressed by his longtime stewardship of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group. He returned to Congress after decades leading the NAACP following the death of a previous Democratic Oversight chair, the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, a fellow Baltimore Democrat.",
      "Lynch, 70, has styled himself as the acting chair and the lawmaker best positioned to take on the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican James Comer of Kentucky.",
      "\u201cThere are some members who speak to a very narrow audience, and that\u2019s great,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "\u201cWe want them to be energized and animated. But that same person is not going to go to the Rust Belt with people that are farmers, moderates, conservatives,\u201d Lynch told The Associated Press. \u201cYou need different voices to appeal to different constituencies.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I have a better chance of bringing back the blue-collar working people, and I have less of a chance of appealing to very younger people who are intensely invested in social media,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "The vote for Oversight ranking member is scheduled for June 24 and will be conducted by secret ballot. All four candidates are speaking before multiple caucuses this week, including the New Democrats and the progressive caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.",
      "While many Democrats are undecided, others have made up their mind. Some who are privately stumping for their candidate believe it will be a tight race. That makes the public forums and private pitches even more crucial in the run-up to the vote.",
      "House progressives are divided over their preferred choice. Three members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2014 Crockett, Garcia and Mfume \u2014 are vying for the ranking member seat, which makes it unlikely the caucus will back a single candidate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for folks that could expose this kind of corruption and hold Trump and his billionaire donors accountable,\u201d said Rep. Greg Casar of Texas, the Progressive Caucus chair.",
      "Rep. Brad Schneider, chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, said he\u2019s weighing two factors: which candidate could best help Democrats win the 2026 midterm elections and whether they can successfully lead investigations into the Trump administration and \u201ctry to repair some of the damage that\u2019s been done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe committee can be a flash point, or it can be a very effective place for us to make our point, and we want to know who\u2019s going to do best in that role to make sure the committee works to help us secure 218 (members) next November,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "Some Democratic caucuses have traditionally prized seniority as a clear and reliable way for lawmakers of color to rise through the ranks. There has never been a Hispanic Oversight chairman and only one Black chairman, Elijah Cummings.",
      "\u201cThe CBC has always stood for seniority,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. But Johnson noted that the Black Caucus has at times \u201cdeviated\u201d from that norm. He said many in the caucus are open to a conversation about age.",
      "\u201cSo, Steve Lynch, I think, is the next senior member. And but as I said, other factors have to be considered and I\u2019m sure that, along with myself, other CBC members are going through that process,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, seniority has had weight,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who said he was undecided on which candidate to back. \u201cBut seniority is not the only thing. And there are times and circumstances where the person with the most seniority has not won. Whether that\u2019s one of these times or not is what we\u2019re going to see.\u201d",

Gavin Newsom is calling President Donald Trump's military intervention at protests over federal immigration policy in Los Angeles an assault on democracy and has sued to try to stop it. Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is putting the National Guard on standby in areas in his state where demonstrations are planned.",
      "The divergent approaches illustrate the ways the two parties are trying to navigate national politics and the role of executive power in enforcing immigration policies.",
      "In his live TV address this week, Newsom said that Trump\u2019s move escalated the situation \u2014 and for political gain.",
      "All 22 other Democratic governors signed a statement sent by the Democratic Governors Association on Sunday backing Newsom, calling the Guard deployment and threats to send in Marines \u201can alarming abuse of power\u201d that \"undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The protests in Los Angeles have mostly been contained to five blocks in a small section of downtown; nearly 200 people were detained on Tuesday and at least seven police officers have been injured.",
      "In Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy military troops for protests.",
      "Since Trump's return to office, Democratic governors have been calculating about when to criticize him, when to emphasize common ground and when to bite their tongues.",
      "The governors' responses are guided partly by a series of political considerations, said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University: How would criticizing Trump play with Democrats, Republicans and independent voters in their states? And for those with presidential ambitions, how does that message resonate nationally?",
      "Democratic governors are weighing a number of considerations.",
      "\u201cThere probably is some concern about retributions \u2014 what the reaction of the administration could be for a governor who takes a strong stance,\" Shields said.",
      "And in this case, polling indicates about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, though that polling was conducted before the recent military deployment.",
      "On other issues, Democratic governors have taken a variety of approaches with Trump.",
      "At a White House meeting in February, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills told Trump, \u201c we\u2019ll see you in court \u201d over his push to cut off funding to the state because it allowed transgender athletes in girls' school sports. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, publicly sparred with Trump during his first term but this time around, has met with him privately to find common ground.",
      "Initially, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green referred to Trump as a \u201cstraight-up dictator,\" but the next month he told a local outlet that he was treading carefully, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize him directly much at all.\"",
      "Apart from their joint statement, some of the highest-profile Democratic governors have not talked publicly about the situation in California. When asked, on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office pointed to a Sunday social media post about the joint statement. Whitmer didn't respond.",
      "The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is set to testify before Congress on Thursday about his state laws protecting people who are in the country without legal status, reiterated in a statement that he stands with Newsom. The office said \u201clocal authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, in an interview Wednesday in The Washington Post, said Trump should not send troops to a weekend protest scheduled in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s injected chaos into the world order, he\u2019s injected it into our economy, he is trying to inject chaos into our streets by doing what he did with the Guard in California,\" Shapiro said.",
      "As state attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, Shapiro routinely boasted that he sued Trump over 40 times and won each time. As governor he has often treaded more carefully, by bashing Trump\u2019s tariffs, but not necessarily targeting Trump himself.",
      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has often clashed with Newsom, a fellow term-limited governor with national ambitions.",
      "Newsom's office said DeSantis offered to send Florida State Guard troops to California.",
      "\u201cGiven the guard were not needed in the first place, we declined Governor DeSantis attempt to inflame an already chaotic situation made worse by his Party\u2019s leader,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, DeSantis said the gesture was a typical offer of mutual aid during a crisis \u2014 and was dismissive of the reasons it was turned down.",
      "\u201cThe way to put the fire out is to make sure you have law and order,\u201d he said.",
      "Protests against immigration enforcement raids have sprung up in other cities \u2014 and a series of \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations are planned for the weekend \u2014 with governors preparing to respond.",
      "In Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he has spoken with his public safety commissioner to make sure state and local police work together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to give the president any pretext to think he can come into Connecticut and militarize the situation. That just makes the situation worse,\u201d said Lamont, who called Trump \"a little eager to send federal troops and militarize the situation in Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "It is unclear how many Texas National Guard members will be deployed or how many cities asked for assistance. In Austin, where police used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred protesters on Monday, the mayor\u2019s office said the National Guard was not requested.",
      "San Antonio officials also said they didn\u2019t request the Guard.",
      "Florida's DeSantis said law enforcement in his state is preparing \u201cThe minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.\u201d",

      "Oklahoma is preparing to execute a man whose transfer to state custody was expedited by the Trump administration",
      "McALESTER, Okla. -- Oklahoma prepared to execute a man Thursday whose transfer to state custody was expedited by the Trump administration.",
      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson's attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month's clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims' families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday on whether the Trump administration can use the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles.",
      "California Gov. Newsom has depicted the federal military intervention in the nation's second largest city as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has echoed that, saying the deployment of troops was unnecessary and meant to undermine local jurisdictions and intimidate the city\u2019s large immigrant population.",
      "Newsom filed an emergency motion requesting the court's intervention after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.",
      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The Democratic governor argued the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and said sending troops to help support immigration raids would only promote civil unrest.",
      "The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the National Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.",
      "Federal immigration agents have been arresting people at Home Depot parking lots and other businesses, sparking fear in immigrant communities, after the Trump administration said it wanted to dramatically increase arrests under its immigration crackdown.",
      "Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.",
      "Most demonstrations have been peaceful but this weekend some turned raucous with protesters setting cars on fire in downtown Los Angeles. The city has imposed a nightly curfew covering a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section where protests have occurred in the sprawling metropolis of 4 million people.",
      "The Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters.",
      "Newsom filed the motion Tuesday, the same day the military announced some members of the National Guard were now standing in protection around federal agents. The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.",
      "Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer chose not to rule immediately but set the hearing for Thursday in federal court in San Francisco.",
      "Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand the raids stop and the troops leave.",

      "The civil lawsuit was filed in a Southern California federal court by the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, the American Immigration Council, Democracy Forward, and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is asking the court to find the proclamation unlawful, set aside the policy ending asylum at ports of entry and restore access to the asylum process at ports of entry, including for those who had appointments that were canceled when President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Unlike a similar lawsuit filed in February in a Washington, D.C., federal court representing people who had already reached U.S. soil and sought asylum after crossing between ports of entry, Wednesday's lawsuit focuses on people who are not on U.S. soil and are seeking asylum at ports of entry.",
      "No response was immediately issued by the Department of Homeland Security or Customs and Border Protection, which were both among the defendants listed.",
      "Trump's sweeping proclamation issued on his first day in office changed asylum policies, effectively ending asylum at the border.

      "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty again, convicted Wednesday of a top sex crimes charge at his #MeToo retrial in New York City. The mixed and partial verdict came more than five years after his first conviction, which an appeals court overturned last year.",
      "The jury returned a verdict on two of three charges against Weinstein, acquitting him of one. Jurors indicated that they had yet to achieve unanimity on the final count. That could mean more deliberations on Thursday.",
      "The verdict capped an extraordinary fifth day of deliberations.",
      "The jury foreperson complained that he was being bullied by other jurors. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer then asked for a mistrial, and Weinstein himself addressed the judge without jurors in the courtroom, imploring him to end the case without a verdict.",
      "Minutes later, the jury of seven women and five men declared the ailing 73-year-old guilty of one count of criminal sex act, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Weinstein denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. Once he\u2019s sentenced, he can appeal.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the verdict:",
      "Jurors convicted Weinstein of one count of criminal sex act, finding that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and movie producer and production assistant, Miriam Haley, nearly two decades ago.",
      "Haley, who had a short stint working on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified that he assaulted her in July 2006 after inviting her to stop by his SoHo apartment before a flight his company booked her on the next day to Los Angeles to attend a movie premiere.",
      "Haley testified that Weinstein backed her into a bedroom, pushed her onto a bed and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Weinstein was convicted of the same charge at his first trial.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, told jurors that she was never interested in any sexual or romantic relationship with Weinstein but still wanted his help professionally.",
      "She acknowledged she kept in touch and exchanged warm messages with him and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, when she said he pulled her into bed for sex.",
      "Weinstein acquitted of a charge of criminal sex act relating to a previously uncharged allegation that he forced oral sex on Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, a psychologist and former Polish model and actor, at a Manhattan hotel in 2006 just before her 20th birthday.",
      "Sokola, who wasn\u2019t a part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, testified that Weinstein assaulted her after luring her to his hotel room by telling her had a script to show her. As he pushed her onto a bed, stripped off her boots, her stockings and her underwear, \u201cmy soul was removed from me,\" she said.",
      "Now 39, Sokola said he held her down while ignoring her pleas of \u201cplease don\u2019t, please stop, I don\u2019t want this.\u201d She said she tried to push him away but was no match against the much larger Weinstein.",
      "Sokola also testified that Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, but that allegation was beyond legal time limits for a potential criminal charge.",
      "Sokola said she stayed in touch with Weinstein because she had dreams of an acting career.",
      "She went to authorities in January 2020, a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial. Prosecutors halted their investigation after Weinstein was convicted, but revived it when the verdict was thrown out last year.",
      "The jury hasn't reached a verdict on a third-degree rape charge involving Jessica Mann\u2019s allegation that Weinstein assaulted her in March 2013.",
      "Mann, a cosmetologist and hairstylist, said she met Weinstein at a party in late 2012 or early 2013, when she was 27 and trying to launch an acting career.",
      "She alleges Weinstein trapped her in a Manhattan hotel room, demanded that she undress as he loomed over her, grabbed her arms and raped her after, she believes, he injected himself with an erection-promoting drug that she later found in the bathroom trash.",
      "Mann said she had a consensual, on-and-off relationship with the then-married Weinstein, but that he was volatile and violated her if she refused him.",
      "She said she kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged rape, telling jurors she \u201ccompartmentalized the part of Harvey that was hurting me,\u201d and that flattery and friendliness \u201ckept the peace.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said the judge in the first trial, James Burke, denied Weinstein a fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that didn't result in charges and by deciding that prosecutors could confront Weinstein, if he testified, about stories of him behaving brutishly.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony.",
      "Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "Prosecutors were not allowed to retry Weinstein on charges that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "Weinstein is appealing his conviction in Los Angeles in a similar case in 2022.",
      "Jurors there found him guilty of three of seven charges, including rape, and he was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argued he did not get a fair trial.",
      "They contend that the judge in the California case wrongly allowed jurors to know about Weinstein\u2019s 2020 New York conviction, and that the jury was unfairly prejudiced by testimony from women about alleged assaults Weinstein was not charged with.",

      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",

      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement they issued",
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement.",
      "A statement published online by the board members said the administration usurped the board\u2019s authority by denying awards to \u201ca substantial number of people\u201d who already had been chosen. Another 1,200 award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\u201cTo continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board\u2019s request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars, and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the scholarship program.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermined the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\u201cWe believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration\u2019s efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation\u2019s most respected and valuable programs.\u201d",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "The announcement comes as the Trump administration ratchets up scrutiny of international students on several fronts. The administration has expanded the grounds for revoking foreign students' legal status, and recently paused scheduling of new interviews for student visas as it increases vetting of their social media activity. The government also has moved to block foreign students from attending Harvard as it pressures the Ivy League school to adopt a series of reforms.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to eliminate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.",
      "The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to \u201c unleash American energy \u201d and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.",
      "If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.",
      "The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\u201d",
      "Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations\u2019 \u201cwar on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that \u2026 no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living \u2026 create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.\u201d",
      "Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals \u201cyet another in a series of attacks\u201d by the Trump administration on the nation's \u201chealth, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.\u201d",
      "She called it \u201cunconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIgnoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIf EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we\u2019ll see them in court.\u201d",
      "The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.",
      "It\u2019s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated \u2014 they can\u2019t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.",
      "Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead \u2014 and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth\u2019s warming to deadlier levels.",
      "Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.",
      "The power sector is the nation\u2019s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.",
      "In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants \u201cdo not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution\u201d or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants \u201care a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: \u201cThis Administration\u2019s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.\u201d",
      "The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.",
      "If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA\u2019s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don\u2019t either and therefore shouldn\u2019t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.",
      "The EPA proposal \u201chas the potential to have much, much broader implications,\u201d she said.",
      "Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to \u201csuffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,\u201d with the intent to regulate the coal industry \u201cout of existence\u201d and make it \u201cdisappear.\u201d",
      "National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove \u201cdeliberately unattainable standards\u201d for clean air while \u201cleveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.\u201d",
      "But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.",
      "\u201cThe world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,\u201d Frumkin said. \u201cThese are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.",
      "\u201cCarbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,\u201d said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in \u201csignificant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending his decision to order National Guard troops to provide security during immigrations raids in Los Angeles",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his decision to order troops to provide security during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, telling senators on Wednesday it's about \u201cmaintaining law and order.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., condemned the move as illegal, saying it erodes military readiness and questioning how it is being funded. It was the second day of harsh congressional questioning for Hegseth on the deployment of troops over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, continued military aid to Ukraine, a deal on a gifted Qatari jet and more.",
      "\u201cThe mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\u201d Hegseth said in response to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored confusion about the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to provide security at the immigration protests and operations in Los Angeles. Photos have shown Guard troops setting a security perimeter around agents as they make arrests in the city, moving them closer to law enforcement functions, which by law they are not allowed to do.",
      "About 2,000 of the Guard soldiers are in place in Los Angeles, initially sent to provide security. The Marines are at a nearby base and have not yet been used.",
      "Speaking at a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing, Reed said law and order is a civil function, not a job for the U.S. military. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., added that the California deployment, along with President Donald Trump's threat to use force against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday, \u201cshould stop every one of us cold.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cthreatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. It is unconstitutional. And it is downright un-American.\u201d",
      "Asked later what constitutional authority the department is using to deploy active duty Marines to the protests, Hegseth said he didn't know the specific provision but would provide it.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Hegseth, was asked whether he sees evidence of \u201crebellion\u201d in the U.S. That could be used to invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement functions.",
      "\u201cThere are definitely some frustrated folks out there,\u201d Caine said in response.",
      "Answering the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s argument that \u201cthere has been an invasion\u201d of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.",
      "Caine, asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I\u2019ll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also faced bipartisan criticism for failing to provide details about the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget and over an array of other decisions he's made during his tenure.",
      "The panel's chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators expressed frustration that Congress has not yet gotten a full defense budget from the Trump administration and that the current level does not have the U.S. spending enough on defense.",
      "McConnell also noted that the limited budget request that lawmakers have received has no funding for Ukraine security assistance, questioning whether that makes \u201clasting peace\u201d more or less likely.",
      "Hegseth, in his opening remarks, said the department needed more time to pull a spending plan together but that he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine makes America look strong, even though Russia is the aggressor. He said the budget includes hard choices and \u201creflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.\"",
      "Hegseth said some U.S. security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline, but he provided no details.",
      "Hegseth repeatedly refused to provide details on plans for the Defense Department to accept a 747 jet offered by Qatar for use as Air Force One. He said budgeting and schedules for security upgrades to turn the plane into the president's aircraft are classified.",
      "Hegseth confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the military to take possession of the aircraft.",
      "That also means no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the Qatari jet.",
      "He refused to answer questions on the cost or potential timeframe of that upgrade \u2014 even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned by Boeing to serve as Air Force One is public.",
      "\u201cA memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,\u201d Hegseth said.",

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that temporary stay of execution be lifted.",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys had argued the 3-2 vote against recommending clemency was tainted because one of the members of the board had worked for the same district attorney\u2019s office that prosecuted his case. The Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s Office maintained the district court judge didn\u2019t have the authority to issue a stay of execution.",
      "The appeals court wrote in its order that the district judge didn't have the authority and that even if he did, the order was \u201can extreme and unwarranted measure\u201d given that even if the member's vote wasn't counted, a tie still would not have resulted in a clemency recommendation.",

      "The mistrial comes a day after the jury foreperson said he was threatened by another juror and did not feel safe. He was given a security detail when he returned to court Thursday, and the judge asked whether he felt he could keep deliberating, to which he replied, \"No, I'm sorry.\"",
      "The judge then thanked the jury for their time and said the decision to declare a mistrial did not reflect on them.",
      "The jury had\u00a0returned a partial verdict Wednesday, finding Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Miriam Haley\u00a0and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against\u00a0Kaja Sokola.",
      "At the time, the jury said they had not yet reached a verdict on the remaining charge of third-degree rape against Jessica Mann, and the judge said they would continue deliberating Thursday.",
      "Jurors say they're disappointed",
      "Some jurors said they were disappointed as they left court, saying they took the case seriously and gave it their best. They said most of the jury felt Weinstein should be convicted of the remaining count, but it came down to one juror who did not want to change his mind.",
      "\"It started rocky, as I'm sure everybody knows by now, it was a rough couple days. Unfortunately, things broke down. A lot of good people in there, a lot of stuff happened,\" a juror, who did not want to be identified, said outside the courthouse.",
      "Weinstein did not appear to have much of a reaction to the mistrial ruling. The 73-year-old could now face another retrial on the rape charge.",
      "\"He's very strong willed, his mind is still sharp,\" Weinstein's publicist Juda Engelmayer said outside court. \"His body is taking a little bit of a toll, but he's a fighter.\"",
      "Manhattan DA's office intends to retry the rape charge",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg held a news conference Thursday afternoon, saying his office intends to retry the rape charge. He said Mann is ready to go to trial for a third time and that she deserves a decision.",
      "\"This is a case about an immense power imbalance. Harvey Weinstein was a wealthy Hollywood gatekeeper, a titan of movies and television for decades. These hopeful young women were trying to follow their dreams in a world that he controlled,\" Bragg said. \"This is a case about correcting commonly held misconceptions about rape. Rape can and does happen between acquaintances and between romantic partners. Rape can and does happen before or after consensual sex, and rape can and does happen years before a survivor is ready to report.\"",
      "\"I will never give up on myself and making sure my voice \u2013 and the truth \u2013 is heard. I have told the District Attorney I am ready, willing and able to endure this as many times as it takes for justice and accountability to be served. Today is not the end of my fight,\" Mann said in a statement Thursday.",
      "A new trial date has not been set, but lawyers will return for a status hearing on July 2 to discuss the future of the case.",
      "When asked to comment about the disagreement among the jury, Bragg said a \"vigorous and robust exchange of ideas within the jury room is an important hallmark of our jury system.\"",
      "Bragg also thanked each of the accusers for coming forward and sharing their difficult testimony, as well as the prosecutors, court staff and jury.",
      "\"Each spent days on the witness stand sharing the most traumatic moments of their lives in a room full of strangers. Their credibility and character were attacked during lengthy cross-examinations, they were accused of being money hungry, they were called liars, they were even told that they, in fact, were the abusers,\" he said. \"But they stood their ground, and for that I am extraordinarily grateful.\"",
      "He encouraged survivors of sexual assault to contact his office's Special Victims Division at 212-335-9373.",
      "Drama in the Weinstein jury deliberations",
      "The deliberations among the seven women and five men on the jury were seemingly tense.",
      "On June 6, one day after deliberations began, a\u00a0juror asked to be removed\u00a0over claims that some jurors were acting unfairly, but the judge denied the request.",
      "Monday, a juror requested to speak with the judge privately. Wednesday, the jury foreperson asked to speak to the judge in private and alleged another juror had threatened him over his decision on the rape charge.",
      "\"Somebody talk to me, 'Oh, we will see you outside,' because I got my decision. I say, 'No, that's my personal decision. You don't have to change me,'\" the foreperson said, according to a transcript.",
      "The defense repeatedly called for a mistrial over the apparent problems among the jury, and Weinstein himself weighed in Wednesday.",
      "\"This isn't fair. This isn't right. I'm the one on trial. This is my life that's on the line, I am not getting a fair trial. You are endangering me,\" he said.",
      "The judge asked the jury foreperson if he felt safe returning to court Thursday, and the jury foreperson said he did, but he was offered court-appointed security.",
      "The jury requested the rules of a hung jury and other rules of deliberations earlier in the week.",
      "The retrial of Harvey Weinstein",
      "New York's highest court\u00a0overturned\u00a0Weinstein's\u00a02020 conviction\u00a0last year, ruling the judge in his first trial should not have allowed testimony from accusers who were not part of the criminal charges. Weinstein then spent months at the\u00a0Rikers Island jail complex\u00a0leading up to his retrial.",
      "Haley and Mann, who testified during the original trial, were back on the stand for the retrial. Sokola was\u00a0not part of the first trial.",
      "Mann alleges Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. She said it happened during a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward, telling the jury she \"compartmentalized\" the pain he caused. Weinstein's lawyers emphasized she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending him messages.",
      "\"Rape can happen in relationships \u2014 and in dynamics where power and manipulation control the narrative,\" Mann said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Haley testified Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006, and Sokola alleged he forcibly performed oral sex on her that same year when she was 19 years old.",
      "\"The defense set a very disruptive and chaotic tone from the very beginning of this trial, which I suppose was meant to distract jury from undeniable facts. And I'm so grateful that they saw through the nonsense and the antics,\" Haley said after Wednesday's partial verdict.",
      "\"I'm very happy he's convicted. That's all that matters,\" said Sokola.",
      "Weinstein, meanwhile, is appealing his\u00a02022 sexual assault conviction in Los Angeles, where he was\u00a0sentenced to 16 years in prison.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 09:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Brian Wilson was one of the world's most influential recording artists.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \"Good Vibrations,\" \"California Girls\" and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died, his family said in a statement posted to his website and social media\u00a0accounts. He was 82.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\" the family said in Wednesday's statement. \"We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.\"",
      "Further details weren't immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson's longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge.",
      "The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock's great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound.",
      "\"It is indeed hard to talk about the influence of Brian Wilson just on music because he is a shaper of American myth and American culture,\" Joe Levy, a contributor to Rolling Stone and Billboard, told CBS News following the news of Wilson's death. \"Our popular ideas about California \u2014 a land of surf and sun \u2014 many of them come from Beach Boys songs.\"",
      "The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Katy Perry and Carole King. The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \"Pet Sounds\" as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \"God Only Knows\" as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears.",
      "Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \"Pet Sounds\" and his restored opus, \"Smile,\" before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go's, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart.",
      "An endless summer",
      "The Beach Boys' music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates.",
      "Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \"Surfin' USA\"; the melting vocals of \"Don't Worry Baby\"; the chants of \"fun, fun, fun\" or \"good, good, GOOD, good vibrations\"; the behind-the-wheel chorus \"'Round, 'round, get around, I get around.\" Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand.",
      "The band's innocent appeal survived the group's increasingly troubled backstory, whether Brian's many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson's ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create.",
      "From the suburbs to the national stage",
      "Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group's only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \"Surfin,'\" a minor hit released in 1961.",
      "They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \"Surfin,'\" they discovered the record label had tagged them \"The Beach Boys.\"",
      "Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band's recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer.",
      "Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \"Surfin' USA,\" so closely modeled on Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \"If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody'd be surfin,' / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\" From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and narrowly missing with \"California Girls\" and \"Fun, Fun, Fun.\" For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby.",
      "Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love's nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \"The Warmth of the Sun\" was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014   he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \"Don't Worry Baby,\" a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man's confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian's crippling anxieties.",
      "Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \"California Girls.\"",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country's answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \"art\" and leaving Wilson a broken man.",
      "The Beach Boys vs. the Beatles",
      "The Beatles opened with \"Rubber Soul,\" released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \"She Loves You\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them.",
      "Wilson worked for months on what became \"Pet Sounds,\" and months on the single \"Good Vibrations.\" He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \"I Know There's an Answer\" to \"You Still Believe in Me,\" many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \"Good Vibrations,\" a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space.",
      "The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \"Good Vibrations\" was the group's first million-seller and \"Pet Sounds,\" which included the hits \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \"concept\" album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \"Pet Sounds\" couldn't be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \"Rhapsody in Blue\" had inspired him since childhood.",
      "But the album didn't chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the Beatles' next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys' vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \"Pet Sounds.\" The Beatles' epic \"A Day in the Life\" reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album to beat.",
      "All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \"teenage symphony to God\" he called \"Smile.\" It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \"Smile,\" then canceled it.",
      "Remnants, including the songs \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Wind Chimes\" were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \"Smiley Smile,\" dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \"bunt instead of a grand slam.\" The stripped down \"Wild Honey,\" released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn't restore the band's reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical '60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.",
      "Years of struggle, and late life validation",
      "Addicted to drugs and psychologically helpless, sometimes idling in a sandbox he had built in his living room, Wilson didn't fully produce another Beach Boys record for years. Their biggest hit of the 1970s was a greatest hits album, \"Endless Summer,\" that also helped reestablish them as popular concert performers.",
      "Although well enough in the 21st century to miraculously finish \"Smile\" and tour and record again, Wilson had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and baffled interviewers with brief and disjointed answers. Among the stranger episodes of Wilson's life was his relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, a psychotherapist accused of holding a Svengali-like power over him. A 1991 lawsuit from Wilson's family blocked Landy from Wilson's personal and business affairs.",
      "His first marriage, to singer Marilyn Rovell, ended in divorce and he became estranged from daughters Carnie and Wendy, who would help form the pop trio Wilson Phillips. His life stabilized in 1995 with his marriage to Melinda Ledbetter, who gave birth to two more daughters, Daria and Delanie. He also reconciled with Carnie and Wendy and they sang together on the 1997 album \"The Wilsons.\" (Melinda Ledbetter died in 2024.)",
      "In 1992, Brian Wilson eventually won a $10 million out-of-court settlement for lost songwriting royalties. But that victory and his 1991 autobiography, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" set off other lawsuits that tore apart the musical family.",
      "Carl Wilson and other relatives believed the book was essentially Landy's version of Brian's life and questioned whether Brian had even read it. Their mother, Audree Wilson, unsuccessfully sued publisher HarperCollins because the book said she passively watched as her husband beat Brian as a child. Love successfully sued Brian Wilson, saying he was unfairly deprived of royalties after contributing lyrics to dozens of songs. He would eventually gain ownership of the band's name.",
      "The Beach Boys still released an occasional hit single: \"Kokomo,\" made without Wilson, hit No. 1 in 1988. Wilson, meanwhile, released such solo albums as \"Brian Wilson\" and \"Gettin' In Over My Head,\" with cameos by McCartney and Clapton among others. He also completed a pair of albums for the Walt Disney label \u2014 a collection of Gershwin songs and music from Disney movies. In 2012, surviving members of the Beach Boys reunited for a 50th anniversary album, which quickly hit the Top 10 before the group again bickered and separated.",
      "Wilson won two competitive Grammys, for the solo instrumental \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" and for \"The Smile Sessions\" box set. Otherwise, his honors ranged from a Grammy lifetime achievement prize to a tribute at the Kennedy Center to induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, he returned to his old high school in Hawthorne and witnessed the literal rewriting of his past: The principal erased an \"F\" he had been given in music and awarded him an \"A.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area.",
      "\"Inova was a regional campus for the VCU School of Medicine at that time. That campus relationship ended in 2021, as did Dr. Ross' faculty status with VCU,\" Ugincius said in an email.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "HHS and Havencrest Capital Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the discrepancies.",

      "The Republicans'\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is aimed at ushering in \"a new golden age in America\" through a combination of tax and spending cuts, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson. But a new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that the bill may prove less golden for some Americans.",
      "The lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households are likely to see their financial resources reduced by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to the June 12 CBO report.",
      "The analysis, which tallies the impact of the bill's tax breaks, reductions in funding for federal programs and changes in matching state funds, notes that the proposed legislation would reduce resources for low-income Americans because of cuts to Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "The CBO found the bill would boost the government resources going to the highest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $12,000 per year, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000.",
      "The agency estimated that, on average, \"household resources would increase over the 2026\u20132034 period, mainly because of reductions in how much households owed in federal taxes,\" CBO said. But those changes would not be evenly distributed the agency said.",
      "\"The agency estimates that in general, resources would decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the middle and top of the income distribution,\" the CBO report noted.",
      "President Trump has urged lawmakers to support the Republican budget measure. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the Trump administration's economic policies, saying they will benefit working class Americans.",
      "\"Democrats and the media unquestioningly ran with CBO's gloomy scoring of President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2014 tax cuts that helped usher in the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump's America First economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth for working-class Americans in his first term, and this agenda will repeat the success in his second term.\"",
      "The analysis could fuel criticism from some congressional Democrats and advocates for low-income Americans that the proposed legislation could hurt the most vulnerable households by stripping away Medicaid and other benefits, while providing the richest Americans with generous tax cuts.",
      "\"As the nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office] just confirmed to me, Trump's budget bill will make it harder for working Americans to make ends meet while sending thousands to the ultra-rich,\" said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, on social media.",

      "A Thursday\u00a0analysis of the CBO report by the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, concluded that the bottom 10% of U.S. households would see an average decrease of more than 6.5% in incomes under the GOP budget bill, while high-income earners would get a boost of 1.5%.",

      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",

      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",

      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",

    "summary": "The federal government now spends more on servicing its debt than it does on defense. The GOP's new tax bill could ratchet that higher, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: the rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that funding financed through the issuance of new government debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

      "While the announcement by Mr. Trump's top negotiators on Tuesday evening of an agreed framework was thin on details, the president\u00a0said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform Wednesday morning that it was \"done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me.\"",

      "There was no immediate confirmation from China's government of any terms agreed to in the framework, or whether President Xi intended to sign off on the deal.",
      "In Geneva, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to put their unprecedented tariffs of more than 100% on each other's imports on hold for 90 days. That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports down to their current level of 30% after they briefly soared to around 145%.",
      "Chinese tariffs currently stand at 10%, after hitting 125% before the Geneva round of talks.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang, who took part in the talks in London, confirmed the agreement on a framework, \"in principle.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday narrowly approved a request from the White House, known as a rescissions package, to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously appropriated.",
      "In a 214 to 212 vote, all but four House Republicans voted in favor of the measure, with all Democrats opposing. The package now heads to the Senate.",
      "President Trump put pressure on Republicans to vote in favor of the bill ahead of the vote, calling it a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"Every single Republican in Congress should vote, 'YES,'\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, looking to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. Its primary focus is slashing foreign aid, from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects, but it would also essentially cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, touted the request to cancel what he called \"wasteful spending\" in recent days, calling it a \"manifestation of the DOGE effort,\" adding that it would \"ensure greater accountability in government going forward.\"",
      "The cuts in the rescissions package",
      "The rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "Johnson said of NPR and PBS that funding them is an outmoded idea because \"we're in a different era now.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds,\" Johnson said. \"Especially those who appear to have so little regard for the truth.\"",
      "The package would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, among other international assistance programs, after the foreign aid agency became an early target of the administration. Johnson said the resolution would make cuts in what he called the \"USAID abuses area.\"",
      "Johnson said DOGE \"went after USAID first for their review, their audits,\" because USAID \"opposed the loudest of this accountability measure,\" claiming they \"put the scrutiny targets on their own backs.\"",
      "But some of the cuts have sparked objections among Republican lawmakers, like cuts to a program aimed at combatting HIV and AIDS globally. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was started by former President George W. Bush, and has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The New York Times he would oppose the rescissions package because of these cuts, though he seemed to warm to the package this week, telling reporters he feels \"better\" about the cuts to the program after the House GOP conference met Tuesday.",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have voiced concerns as well.",
      "\"PEPFAR cuts make no sense to me whatsoever, given the extraordinary record of PEPFAR in saving lives,\" Collins told reporters last week, while pointing to several other global health care programs targeted in the rescissions package. \"So, I have a lot of concerns.\"",
      "But Republican leaders in Congress were bullish about the path forward.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday that \"our members are ready to go lock in some of those DOGE cuts,\" adding that \"this is a start \u2014 it's a good start, it's an important first step and we're going to take it on Thursday.\"",
      "Johnson said the vote on the package \"is an important signal \u2014 House Republicans are serious about getting our fiscal house in order, and we'll do that.\"",
      "The rescissions process",
      "Congress can cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated under the rescissions process. Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The White House's official transmission of the rescission package on June 3 started the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. Rescissions requests first go before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes. In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber and only require a simple majority.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that Collins, the top Republican appropriator in the Senate, would receive the package in the upper chamber.

      "The agency estimated that, on average, \"household resources would increase over the 2026\u20132034 period, mainly because of reductions in how much households owed in federal taxes,\" CBO said. But those changes would not be evenly distributed the agency said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers are calling for answers after Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, expressed shock over \"the manhandling of a United States senator,\" adding that he wants answers \"to what the hell went on.\"",
      "Padilla stood up and walked to the front of the room while Noem was speaking and tried to ask her a question. Federal agents began shoving him out of the room as he said, \"Hands off, hands off. I am Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.\" Once outside the room, the agents placed him on the ground and put him in handcuffs. His office said Padilla was in Los Angeles \"exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California\" and was in the building for a separate briefing.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said Secret Service agents \"thought [Padilla] was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.\" Noem told reporters that she and Padilla met after her press conference and had a \"very productive\" conversation.",
      "\"I wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk,\" Noem said. \"His approach, you know, was something that I don't think was appropriate at all. But the conversation was great and we're going to continue to communicate. We exchanged phone numbers and we're going to continue to talk on we can communicate better.\"",
      "Nonetheless, Sen. Adam Schiff, Padilla's fellow California senator, called on Noem to resign and said there should be an investigation into law enforcement's conduct.",
      "\"It's just outrageous and disgraceful and sickening to watch,\" he said. \"In the video, he's identifying himself as Sen. Alex Padilla, so I have no doubt that they understood exactly who he was, and that makes it all the more troubling.\"",
      "Schiff added that Padilla has \"every right to ask questions\" and \"to be treated the way he was, to be essentially brought to the ground and shackled after identifying himself, is a disgraceful action.\"",
      "Schiff was one of a slew of Senate Democrats who took to the Senate floor following the incident. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon reiterated Schumer's call for an investigation, saying he was \"extremely outraged.\" Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said \"this to me is such an abuse of authority\" and \"there can be no justification.\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said it was \"unacceptable\" and that Democrats and Republicans should condemn the way Padilla was treated.",
      "\"I have been here for more than 32 years,\" Murray said. \"I have never come this close to having tears in my eyes as I speak to both sides of this aisle about this horrendous incident that occurred.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called it \"an assault on the rule of law\" and \"an assault on our democracy.\"",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said \"there is no context that justifies this action.\"",
      "\"This is the stuff of dictatorships,\" Schatz said. \"It is actually happening. A United States senator was manhandled, shoved to the ground and cuffed.\"",
      "Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, likewise called on Noem to resign.",
      "\"Secretary Noem, you should resign,\" Cortez Masto said in a post on X. \"You're head of Homeland Security and you can't take a question from a sitting U.S. Senator at a press conference? This level of abuse of power is shameful, outrageous, and is not doing anything to keep our homeland safe.\"",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, brought up the incident during a House committee hearing on immigration, saying he was \"horrified\" and asking the Democratic governors before him, \"tell me how you would feel if Marines were sent into your state or your senators were taken by the fists and pushed out of rooms?\"",
      "\"What is going on in this country?\" Khanna added.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom also shared an image of Padilla on X, saying, \"If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you.\"",
      "The outrage wasn't only among Democrats. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told reporters she had seen a clip of the incident, calling it \"horrible.\"",
      "\"It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters that he had seen video of Padilla's removal but wanted more information before commenting further on the matter.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge will consider Thursday whether to temporarily restrict President Trump's use of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to assist with federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.",
      "The hearing in San Francisco marks the first test of Mr. Trump's decision to place more than 4,000 members of the California National Guard under federal control and send 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as they conduct immigration arrests.",
      "The Trump administration's immigration crackdown sparked protests in California's largest city, which the president said in a June 7 memorandum constitutes \"a form of rebellion against\" the U.S. that allowed him to call up the National Guard under Title 10. Since the president deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, protests have popped up in several cities, including Austin, Boston and New York City.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Los Angeles Police Department said there have been at least 400 arrests since Saturday stemming from protests and other criminal activity in the downtown area.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that the military had to be sent into Los Angeles to protect ICE and other federal employees performing their duties, as well as government property. But the decision has escalated tensions with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who claimed the presence of the military in city streets threatened to destabilize the community and lead to an escalation.",
      "Newsom's lawsuit",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the president's move and asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who is presiding over the case, for early intervention Tuesday.",
      "The governor argued that Mr. Trump \"unlawfully bypassed\" him when the president called the National Guard into service without his permission and said the federal law invoked by Mr. Trump to deploy the troops \u2014 Title 10 \u2014 does not give him the authority to do so under the current circumstances.",
      "Newsom had asked Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, to temporarily limit troops to providing indirect assistance to federal officials by protecting immigration detention facilities or other federal buildings, or defending government employees at risk of physical harm. California officials want the judge to block the military from assisting in law-enforcement functions such as executing warrants, arrests, searches or checkpoints.",
      "\"These unlawful deployments have already proven to be a deeply inflammatory and unnecessary provocation, anathema to our laws limiting the use [of] federal forces for law enforcement, rather than a means of restoring calm,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote in a filing. \"Federal antagonization, through the presence of soldiers in the streets, has already caused real and irreparable damage to the city of Los Angeles, the people who live there, and the State of California. They must be stopped, immediately.\"",
      "Breyer declined to immediately grant California officials relief and instead set a hearing for Thursday afternoon to consider the request.",
      "In a filing submitted to the court, the Trump administration called Newsom's request for relief a \"crass political stunt endangering American lives.\"",
      "\"There is no rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law. And the president has every right under the Constitution and by statute to call forth the National Guard and Marines to quell lawless violence directed against enforcement of federal law,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "During testimony on Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was asked whether he would abide by the judge's decision on the president's use of military forces in Los Angeles in response to the protests. Hegseth declined to definitively say and instead criticized federal judges.",
      "\"We've always looked at the decisions of the court,\" he said, adding \"we should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country.\"",
      "Military officials have said that the Marines on the ground in Los Angeles do not have the authority to arrest people and are there to protect federal property and personnel. U.S. law prohibits the use of active-duty military for domestic law enforcement purposes unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested earlier this week that he would use the law, which dates back to 1792, \"if there's an insurrection.\"",
      "As of Wednesday, roughly 2,800 National Guard and Marines are serving under the command of Task Force 51 and have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, according to U.S. Northern Command. There are an additional 2,000 to-be-identified National Guardsmen under federal command, according to the Defense Department.",
      "The task force's mission is to protect federal personnel and property in the greater Los Angeles-area, and members have accompanied ICE on missions, according to U.S. Northern Command. It said the forces do not conduct civilian law enforcement functions, but can temporarily detain a person in \"specific circumstances,\" such as to stop an assault or prevent interference with federal personnel performing their duties.",
      "\"They protect; they don't participate,\" it said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference in Los Angeles that immigration authorities have \"tens of thousands of targets,\" but declined to say how many migrants have been arrested. Two officials with the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday that 330 migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully have been arrested in Los Angeles since Friday, and 113 of them had prior criminal convictions.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge Thursday in a combative congressional hearing that the Pentagon has developed plans to take over Greenland and Panama by force, if necessary.",
      "Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee had a few heated exchanges with Hegseth, but in one back-and-forth, Hegseth gave an answer that seemed to take some lawmakers by surprise. Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington asked the secretary whether the Defense Department has plans to take\u00a0Greenland or Panama by force if necessary.",
      "\"Our job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any contingency,\" Hegseth said multiple times.",
      "Smith followed up, \"Including the contingency of basically invading Denmark?\"",
      "\"Any contingency you need, we've got it,\" Hegseth answered. \"We got a building full of planners, and we're prepared to give recommendations whenever needed.\"",
      "Smith asked again,\"You have plans to take Panama and Greenland by force, if necessary?\"",
      "\"I think the American people would want the Pentagon to have plans for any particular contingency \u2014\"",
      "\"Not for that,\" Smith said, interrupting him as Hegseth finished his answer, saying, \"\u2014 and thankfully, we are in the planning business.\"",
      "\"Speaking on behalf of the American people, I don't think the American people voted for President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland,\" Smith said.",
      "It isn't unusual for the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for conflicts that have not arisen, but his handling of the questions prompted a Republican lawmaker to step in a few minutes later.",
      "\"Lawyer here, I just want to help because help you out because people try to, you know, twist your words,\" Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said to Hegseth. \"You are not confirming in your testimony today that at the Pentagon, there are plans for invading or taking by force Greenland, correct? That is not your testimony today?\"",
      "\"All my testimony is, is that the Pentagon has plans for any number of contingencies,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"It is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\" Turner continued. \"Because I sure as hell hope that it is not your testimony.\"",
      "\"We look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\" Hegseth responded.",
      "Given the opportunity, President Trump has\u00a0declined to rule out\u00a0military intervention in Greenland.",
      "\"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News in March.",
      "\"There's a good possibility it could be done without military force,\" Mr. Trump said, but adding, \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said multiple times that he wants to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island nation of\u00a0Greenland, long a U.S. ally. Those remarks have been met with flat rejections from Greenland's leaders.",
      "\"Greenland is not for sale,\" Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland's representative to the U.S, said Thursday at a forum in Washington sponsored by the Arctic Institute.",
      "Time and again on Thursday, lawmakers pressed Hegseth to answer questions he has avoided for months, including during the two previous days of hearings on Capitol Hill. And frustration boiled over for some Democrats.",
      "\"You're an embarrassment to this country. You're unfit to lead,\" Rep. Salud Carbajal snapped, the California Democrat's voice rising. \"You should just get the hell out.\"",
      "Hegseth's use of Signal chats",
      "Hegseth's use of two\u00a0Signal chats\u00a0to discuss plans for U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen with other U.S. leaders as well as members of his family prompted dizzying exchanges with lawmakers.",
      "He was pressed multiple times over whether or not he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.",
      "He argued that the classification markings of any information about those military operations could not be discussed with lawmakers.",
      "That became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted \u2014 on strike times and munitions dropped in March \u2014 was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.",
      "\"You can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,\" Moulton said.",
      "\"What's not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,\" Hegseth responded.",
      "A Pentagon watchdog report on Hegseth's Signal use is expected soon.",
      "Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general finds that he placed classified information on Signal, a commercially available app.",

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about so-called \"sanctuary policies\" as protests against the Trump administration's efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement throughout the country. Republicans accused the governors of stonewalling those operations and criticized state and local sanctuary policies that prevent cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Let me be clear: Sanctuary policies do not protect Americans. They protect criminal illegal aliens,\" Oversight Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican said in his opening statement.",
      "The governors' appearances come as President Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0remain embroiled in a legal and political standoff\u00a0over the deployment of the National Guard troops and Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\u00a0Demonstrations have spread to other U.S. cities, including New York and Chicago, following a series of deportation raids.",
      "The hearing",
      "Comer claimed state and local officials are \"actively undermining federal immigration enforcement,\" saying legislative action is needed to \"stop this subversion and stop the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Despite President Trump's efforts to secure the border and enforce the law, Democrat-run sanctuary cities and states are siding with illegal aliens,\" Comer said. \"For today's Democrat Party, it seems unlimited illegal immigration isn't a failure of policy \u2014 it is the policy.\"",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, rebuked the Trump administration for its response to protests in L.A. in his opening statement, calling it \"thuggery.\"",
      "\"This is wrong. Deploying the military against a civilian population is wrong,\" Lynch said. \"If we don't step up and declare what is right under our Constitution, then other cities, other citizens, will meet this same fate.\"",
      "Walz pushed back on the premise of the hearing in his opening statement, saying \"nothing Minnesota has done to serve its own people stands in the way of the federal government managing border security and policies.\" And he noted that \"while you've convened this hearing to explore the issue of so-called sanctuary states, Minnesota is not even a sanctuary state.\"",
      "The Minnesota governor said that enforcing immigration law \"is not the role of local and state governments,\" saying \"it's the federal government's job to secure the border.\"",
      "The former vice presidential candidate has drawn intense scrutiny not only over immigration policy but also for his handling of social justice protests that broke out in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd in 2020. At the time, Walz made the controversial decision to deploy the state's National Guard.\u00a0Trump administration officials have cited Walz' actions\u00a0to justify the president's decision to federalize troops in California, and Republicans on the panel repeatedly invoked his handling of the 2020 protests during Thursday's hearing.",
      "Ahead of the session, the GOP-led panel released a video compilation\u00a0of various news clips accusing the governors of \"shielding\" undocumented immigrants and \"causing chaos\" in their states.",
      "A memo from Hochul's office suggested the hearing could be \"derailed by wild accusations\" and \"twisted characterizations\" but noted the governor's position is \"clear\" when it comes to supporting strong borders and comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "Hochul addressed the influx of more than 220,000 migrants to New York City since early 2022, many of whom were bussed from border states, in her opening statement. \"New York has managed an unprecedented immigrant influx because of a broken border,\" she said, adding that \"at the same time, our state has become stronger and safer.\"",
      "\"My views on immigration are simple and direct,\" Hochul said. \"Our nation needs secure borders. Our nation needs comprehensive immigration reform from this body. And our state laws dictate that we cooperate with ICE in criminal cases, and our values dictate that we treat all law-abiding people with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Pritzker said Illinois also stepped up to the challenge, and blamed the lack of federal intervention and cooperation from border states for exacerbating the problem.",
      "\"Illinois follows the law, but let me be clear, we expect the federal government to follow the law, too,\" Pritzker said. \"We will not participate in abuses of power.\"",
      "The Illinois governor said \"it's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement just to inflame a situation and create a crisis,\" Pritzker said.",
      "The hearing featured a handful of heated moments between the Democratic governors and Republican lawmakers. GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York grilled Hochul over what the two agreed were \"horrific crimes\" that occurred in the state. Stefanik claimed they came as a result of \"Kathy Hochul's failed policies.\" Hochul accused Stefanik of \"going after the viral moment\" with her line of questioning.",

      "A defense official told CBS News the Marines arrived in greater Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, joining about 2,100 members of the California National Guard who are now operating in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton. Acting Defense Department comptroller Bryn MacDonnell estimated the cost of deploying the National Guard will be $134 million while testifying Tuesday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.",
      "Based at Twentynine Palms, a city some 140 miles east of L.A., the 700 Marines finished training for duty within two days of arriving and could be deployed to protests by Friday, according to the Department of Defense.",

      "Federalized guardsmen \"can and have accompanied ICE on missions, but they are not a part of operations,\" the U.S. Northern Command said in a separate statement, citing Title 10. Concerns exist as to whether Mr. Trump would try to override that kind of restriction by invoking the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law that \"authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations,\" according to the Brennan Center for Justice.",

      "\"If you do not live or work in downtown L.A., avoid the area,\" Bass said. \"Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew and you will be prosecuted.\"",
      "Tensions in parts of the city had\u00a0escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to control the crowd.",
      "California sues over use of troops",
      "\"We don't need the National Guard, and they are not here to help us right now,\" \u00a0L.A. Police Chief Jim McDonnell\u00a0said Wednesday in an interview with CBS News. \"They are here to facilitate what the federal agencies are doing on the immigration front.\"",
      "Earlier, California officials asked a federal judge to issue an order restricting how the Trump administration can use Marines and National Guard troops in response to the protests. The state\u00a0sued\u00a0the Trump administration on Monday for deploying the Guard without consulting Newsom, a move the governor had\u00a0called \"illegal and immoral\"\u00a0in a social media post. In\u00a0another post\u00a0Monday morning, Newsom said Mr. Trump \"illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" adding, \"We're suing him.\"",
      "Newsom suggested late Monday that his office could pursue additional legal action against the administration over its planned use of Marines, which the governor also called illegal.",
      "By the end of Wednesday, at least 851 people had been arrested in the L.A. area since the protests started, various law enforcement agencies confirmed. Nearly half were taken into LAPD custody, on charges that ranged from failure to disperse, objects and fireworks thrown at officers, and looting and arson.",
      "California Highway Patrol has also arrested at least 106 people and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has arrested at least another nine, the agencies told CBS News.",
      "LAPD Chief McDonnell addressed complaints over the weekend that accused police of responding too slowly to the unrest, saying that police must comply with the California Values Act, a Los Angeles \"sanctuary city\" ordinance also known as SB 54, which prevents state and local law enforcement agencies from participating in federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Protests against federal immigration enforcement actions have cropped up around the U.S. since they initially sparked in Los Angeles. San Francisco issued a statement late Monday about demonstrations in that city, saying, \"Thousands participated in demonstrations today that were overwhelmingly peaceful. At the very end of the night, two small groups broke off and committed vandalism and other criminal acts. Detained multiple individuals who refused to comply and made arrests.\" The statement referred to protests at the city's Civic Center and in its Mission District.",
      "National Guard troops mobilized and Marines activated",
      "The military said Monday that it was\u00a0mobilizing another 2,000 members\u00a0of the California National Guard to respond to the protests.",
      "Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell\u00a0said on X late Monday\u00a0that the additional troops have been \"called into federal service to support ICE & to enable federal law-enforcement officers to safely conduct their duties.\"",
      "The move adds to 2,000 National Guard troops who were\u00a0called up\u00a0by the president late Saturday to protect federal personnel and property.",
      "The military\u00a0also activated\u00a0about 700 active-duty Marines on Monday to assist the Guard, U.S. Northern Command said in a\u00a0statement. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines are based in Twentynine Palms, a city east of Los Angeles.",
      "L.A. demonstrations intensified over the weekend",
      "Sunday's protests in Los Angeles, a sprawling city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.",
      "The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.",
      "McDonnell, the L.A. police chief, said officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.",
      "Many protesters dispersed that night as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting people who didn't leave. But some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.",
      "CBS News Los Angeles reported Sunday that several fires were set in dumpsters and trash bins, and at least one store had windows shattered by alleged looters. Dozens of buildings were tagged with graffiti, including the LAPD Headquarters, the U.S. Courthouse and the old Los Angeles Times building.",
      "Footage from the CBS News Los Angeles helicopter showed that multiple windows of the police headquarters had been shattered as well.",
      "Mr. Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.",
      "\"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Starting in the morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted \"shame\" and \"go home.\" After some closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.",
      "Minutes later, L.A. police fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, whom they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 Freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.",
      "Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "Flash-bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.",
      "How the demonstrations started",
      "The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.",
      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "In San Francisco, officials said\u00a0154 people were arrested\u00a0Saturday during demonstrations denouncing ICE raids.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "In addition to suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard members, Newsom suggested late Monday that\u00a0California would also sue over the deployment of the Marines\u00a0to L.A.",
      "\"U.S. Marines serve a valuable purpose for this country \u2014 defending democracy. They are not political pawns,\" the governor wrote in\u00a0a post on X. \"The Secretary of Defense is illegally deploying them onto American streets so Trump can have a talking point at his parade this weekend. It's a blatant abuse of power.\"",
      "Newsom had requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",
      "But McDonnell, the LAPD chief, said the protests were following a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things ramping up in the second and third days.",
      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, during a news conference Tuesday night, said, \"Trump, without consulting California leaders, commandeered 2,000 of our state's National Guard members to deploy on our streets illegally and for no reason. This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president enflamed a combustible situation.\"",
      "He criticized the immigration raids as \"weakness masquerading as strength.\"",
      "\"What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence, to be complicit in this moment,\" Newsom said. \"Do not give in to him.\"",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",
      "\"He's using deportation as a way to enhance his position with all those right-wingers out there who do not want this country to be a country of people coming from other places,\" the Democrat told a reporter outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. \"I think he's up to creating martial law.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the Trump administration's actions in L.A. on Sunday, calling the deployment of the National Guard \"a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.\"",
      "\"In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,\" said Harris, who also previously served as a senator and attorney general of California. \"This Administration's actions are not about public safety \u2014 they're about stoking fear. Fear of a community demanding dignity and due process.\"",
      "How big are the protests?",
      "The protests didn't reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.",
      "The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Camilo  Montoya-Galvez and \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump launched a website for his $5 million \"Trump card,\" offering a legal pathway to U.S. citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's $5 million pathway for wealthy immigrants to achieve legal U.S. residency now has a website where aspiring visa holders can join a waitlist for what he's calling the \"Trump card.\"",
      "In a\u00a0social media post\u00a0late Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that \"thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the Greatest Country and Market anywhere in the World,\" referring to the United States.",
      "\"FOR FIVE MILLION $DOLLARS, THE TRUMP CARD IS COMING,\" he wrote in the post.",
      "The president first unveiled the new pathway in February, when he termed it a \"gold card\" that would be aimed at wealthy foreigners who want to bypass the typical pathways to earn legal residency. The term is a play on the permanent residency card, colloquially known as a \"green card,\" which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S.",
      "In his Wednesday post, the president included a link to the card's new website, Trumpcard.gov, whose landing page reads, \"The Trump Card is Coming.\" The site instructs applicants to enter their personal information in order to be notified \"the moment access opens.\"",
      "The website also features an image of the gold card, which is decorated with images of Mr. Trump's face and the Statue of Liberty, the term \"5M\" and Mr. Trump's signature.",
      "How do you apply?",
      "At Trumpcard.gov, applicants are instructed to provide their first and last names; indicate whether they are applying for the card as an individual, business, or other entity; and whether they are applying for themselves, or on behalf of their spouse, family or someone else.",
      "They're also asked to choose from a list of eight regions that they're from, which include:",

      "Caribbean",
      "Africa",
      "Potential applicants are also asked to submit an email address to be added to a waitlist.",
      "In a March speech, Mr. Trump had described the $5 million card as being \"like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country.\" Like the green card, the new card could help holders achieve citizenship, Mr. Trump said at the time.",
      "\"It's a road to citizenship for people \u2014 and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country,\" he said earlier this year.",
      "However, there are questions about whether Mr. Trump has the authority to issue such cards because any new visa program must be approved by Congress through legislation, according to immigration law firm Herman Legal Group.",
      "The Trump administration could use an immigration authority called \"parole,\" which was used by former President Biden to allow many immigrants to enter the U.S. legally, the Cato Institute noted.",
      "\"[H]is administration has taken the position that this type of 'categorical' parole is unlawful,\" the Cato Institute noted. \"It is doubtful that wealthy people would pay $5 million for something with dubious legal standing or a temporary status that could be rescinded at any time.\"",
      "How much money could the Trump card raise?",
      "The Trump administration has said it intends for the Trump card to replace the EB-5 visa, which was launched in 1990 and allows non-citizens to obtain a residency visa in exchange for investing in the U.S. and committing to creating jobs for U.S. citizens.",
      "Earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in remarks at the Oval Office that the EB-5 visa program is \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area.",
      "\"Inova was a regional campus for the VCU School of Medicine at that time. That campus relationship ended in 2021, as did Dr. Ross' faculty status with VCU,\" Ugincius said in an email.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner, and says he previously worked as an executive for India-based drugmaker Cadila Pharmaceutical. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "HHS and Havencrest Capital Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the discrepancies.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "A 2023 presentation by Hibbeln about seafood intake in pregnancy listed him as a professor at the University of Bristol and a psychiatrist for California-based Mindful Health Solutions.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year. He said none of his suggestions were among Kennedy's picks.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",

      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:28:03 -0400",
    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 12:14:26 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA wants to evaluate recent efforts to stop a small but persistent air leak in the Russian segment of the space station.",
    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia.

    "summary": "The House is expected to vote Thursday on White House's rescission package to claw back funding for NPR, PBS, foreign aid.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday narrowly approved a request from the White House, known as a rescissions package, to claw back funding for NPR, PBS and international aid that lawmakers had previously appropriated.",
      "In a 214 to 212 vote, all but four House Republicans voted in favor of the measure, with all Democrats opposing. The package now heads to the Senate.",
      "President Trump put pressure on Republicans to vote in favor of the bill ahead of the vote, calling it a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"Every single Republican in Congress should vote, 'YES,'\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The package would cancel $9.4 billion appropriated by Congress, looking to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts. Its primary focus is slashing foreign aid, from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects, but it would also essentially cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, touted the request to cancel what he called \"wasteful spending\" in recent days, calling it a \"manifestation of the DOGE effort,\" adding that it would \"ensure greater accountability in government going forward.\"",
      "The cuts in the rescissions package",
      "The rescissions package includes $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" PBS received $325 million in CPB funding this year.",
      "Johnson said of NPR and PBS that funding them is an outmoded idea because \"we're in a different era now.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds,\" Johnson said. \"Especially those who appear to have so little regard for the truth.\"",
      "The package would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, among other international assistance programs, after the foreign aid agency became an early target of the administration. Johnson said the resolution would make cuts in what he called the \"USAID abuses area.\"",
      "Johnson said DOGE \"went after USAID first for their review, their audits,\" because USAID \"opposed the loudest of this accountability measure,\" claiming they \"put the scrutiny targets on their own backs.\"",
      "But some of the cuts have sparked objections among Republican lawmakers, like cuts to a program aimed at combatting HIV and AIDS globally. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was started by former President George W. Bush, and has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The New York Times he would oppose the rescissions package because of these cuts, though he seemed to warm to the package this week, telling reporters he feels \"better\" about the cuts to the program after the House GOP conference met Tuesday.",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, have voiced concerns as well.",
      "\"PEPFAR cuts make no sense to me whatsoever, given the extraordinary record of PEPFAR in saving lives,\" Collins told reporters last week, while pointing to several other global health care programs targeted in the rescissions package. \"So, I have a lot of concerns.\"",
      "But Republican leaders in Congress were bullish about the path forward.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday that \"our members are ready to go lock in some of those DOGE cuts,\" adding that \"this is a start \u2014 it's a good start, it's an important first step and we're going to take it on Thursday.\"",
      "Johnson said the vote on the package \"is an important signal \u2014 House Republicans are serious about getting our fiscal house in order, and we'll do that.\"",
      "The rescissions process",
      "Congress can cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent but has previously appropriated under the rescissions process. Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The White House's official transmission of the rescission package on June 3 started the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. Rescissions requests first go before relevant committees for consideration, before moving to the full House and Senate for votes. In the Senate, rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber and only require a simple majority.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Thursday that Collins, the top Republican appropriator in the Senate, would receive the package in the upper chamber. He said the Senate is prioritizing the massive budget bill that's key to enacting Mr. Trump's agenda, pushing work on the rescissions package likely into July.",

But a new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that the bill may prove less golden for some Americans.",
      "The lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households are likely to see their financial resources reduced by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to the June 12 CBO report.",
      "The analysis, which tallies the impact of the bill's tax breaks, reductions in funding for federal programs and changes in matching state funds, notes that the proposed legislation would reduce resources for low-income Americans because of cuts to Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "The CBO found the bill would boost the government resources going to the highest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $12,000 per year, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000.",
      "The agency estimated that, on average, \"household resources would increase over the 2026\u20132034 period, mainly because of reductions in how much households owed in federal taxes,\" CBO said. But those changes would not be evenly distributed the agency said.",
      "\"The agency estimates that in general, resources would decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the middle and top of the income distribution,\" the CBO report noted.",
      "President Trump has urged lawmakers to support the Republican budget measure. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the Trump administration's economic policies, saying they will benefit working class Americans.",
      "\"Democrats and the media unquestioningly ran with CBO's gloomy scoring of President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2014 tax cuts that helped usher in the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump's America First economic agenda unleashed historic job, wage, and economic growth for working-class Americans in his first term, and this agenda will repeat the success in his second term.\"",
      "The analysis could fuel criticism from some congressional Democrats and advocates for low-income Americans that the proposed legislation could hurt the most vulnerable households by stripping away Medicaid and other benefits, while providing the richest Americans with generous tax cuts.",
      "\"As the nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office] just confirmed to me, Trump's budget bill will make it harder for working Americans to make ends meet while sending thousands to the ultra-rich,\" said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, on social media.",
      "Boyle, who with House minority leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries asked the CBO for the analysis, added, \"Republicans are stealing hard-earned money from working people to enrich billionaires.\"",
      "Previous analyses from nonpartisan think tanks such as the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies, have come to similar conclusions about the bill's impact.",
      "Penn Wharton forecasts that the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $1,035 in 2026, while the top 0.1% of income earners would get an after-tax boost of $389,000 due to the bill's provisions.",
      "A Thursday\u00a0analysis of the CBO report by the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, concluded that the bottom 10% of U.S. households would see an average decrease of more than 6.5% in incomes under the GOP budget bill, while high-income earners would get a boost of 1.5%.",

      "Padilla stood up and walked to the front of the room while Noem was speaking and tried to ask her a question. Federal agents began shoving him out of the room as he said, \"Hands off, hands off. I am Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.\" Once outside the room, the agents placed him on the ground and put him in handcuffs. His office said Padilla was in Los Angeles \"exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California\" and was in the building for a separate briefing.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said Secret Service agents \"thought [Padilla] was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.\" Noem told reporters that she and Padilla met after her press conference and had a \"very productive\" conversation.",
      "\"I wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk,\" Noem said. \"His approach, you know, was something that I don't think was appropriate at all. But the conversation was great and we're going to continue to communicate. We exchanged phone numbers and we're going to continue to talk on we can communicate better.\"",
      "Nonetheless, Sen. Adam Schiff, Padilla's fellow California senator, called on Noem to resign and said there should be an investigation into law enforcement's conduct.",
      "\"It's just outrageous and disgraceful and sickening to watch,\" he said. \"In the video, he's identifying himself as Sen. Alex Padilla, so I have no doubt that they understood exactly who he was, and that makes it all the more troubling.\"",
      "Schiff added that Padilla has \"every right to ask questions\" and \"to be treated the way he was, to be essentially brought to the ground and shackled after identifying himself, is a disgraceful action.\"",
      "Schiff was one of a slew of Senate Democrats who took to the Senate floor following the incident. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon reiterated Schumer's call for an investigation, saying he was \"extremely outraged.\" Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said \"this to me is such an abuse of authority\" and \"there can be no justification.\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said it was \"unacceptable\" and that Democrats and Republicans should condemn the way Padilla was treated.",
      "\"I have been here for more than 32 years,\" Murray said. \"I have never come this close to having tears in my eyes as I speak to both sides of this aisle about this horrendous incident that occurred.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called it \"an assault on the rule of law\" and \"an assault on our democracy.\"",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said \"there is no context that justifies this action.\"",
      "\"This is the stuff of dictatorships,\" Schatz said. \"It is actually happening. A United States senator was manhandled, shoved to the ground and cuffed.\"",
      "Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, likewise called on Noem to resign.",
      "\"Secretary Noem, you should resign,\" Cortez Masto said in a post on X. \"You're head of Homeland Security and you can't take a question from a sitting U.S. Senator at a press conference? This level of abuse of power is shameful, outrageous, and is not doing anything to keep our homeland safe.\"",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, brought up the incident during a House committee hearing on immigration, saying he was \"horrified\" and asking the Democratic governors before him, \"tell me how you would feel if Marines were sent into your state or your senators were taken by the fists and pushed out of rooms?\"",
      "\"What is going on in this country?\" Khanna added.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom also shared an image of Padilla on X, saying, \"If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you.\"",

Since the president deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, protests have popped up in several cities, including Austin, Boston and New York City.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Los Angeles Police Department said there have been at least 400 arrests since Saturday stemming from protests and other criminal activity in the downtown area.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that the military had to be sent into Los Angeles to protect ICE and other federal employees performing their duties, as well as government property. But the decision has escalated tensions with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who claimed the presence of the military in city streets threatened to destabilize the community and lead to an escalation.",
      "Newsom's lawsuit",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration over the president's move and asked U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who is presiding over the case, for early intervention Tuesday.",
      "The governor argued that Mr. Trump \"unlawfully bypassed\" him when the president called the National Guard into service without his permission and said the federal law invoked by Mr. Trump to deploy the troops \u2014 Title 10 \u2014 does not give him the authority to do so under the current circumstances.",
      "Newsom had asked Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, to temporarily limit troops to providing indirect assistance to federal officials by protecting immigration detention facilities or other federal buildings, or defending government employees at risk of physical harm. California officials want the judge to block the military from assisting in law-enforcement functions such as executing warrants, arrests, searches or checkpoints.",
      "\"These unlawful deployments have already proven to be a deeply inflammatory and unnecessary provocation, anathema to our laws limiting the use [of] federal forces for law enforcement, rather than a means of restoring calm,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote in a filing. \"Federal antagonization, through the presence of soldiers in the streets, has already caused real and irreparable damage to the city of Los Angeles, the people who live there, and the State of California. They must be stopped, immediately.\"",

      "In a filing submitted to the court, the Trump administration called Newsom's request for relief a \"crass political stunt endangering American lives.\"",
      "\"There is no rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law. And the president has every right under the Constitution and by statute to call forth the National Guard and Marines to quell lawless violence directed against enforcement of federal law,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",

      "Military officials have said that the Marines on the ground in Los Angeles do not have the authority to arrest people and are there to protect federal property and personnel. U.S. law prohibits the use of active-duty military for domestic law enforcement purposes unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act.",

      "It isn't unusual for the Pentagon to draw up contingency plans for conflicts that have not arisen, but his handling of the questions prompted a Republican lawmaker to step in a few minutes later.",
      "\"Lawyer here, I just want to help because help you out because people try to, you know, twist your words,\" Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said to Hegseth. \"You are not confirming in your testimony today that at the Pentagon, there are plans for invading or taking by force Greenland, correct? That is not your testimony today?\"",
      "\"All my testimony is, is that the Pentagon has plans for any number of contingencies,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"It is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\" Turner continued. \"Because I sure as hell hope that it is not your testimony.\"",
      "\"We look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\" Hegseth responded.",
      "Given the opportunity, President Trump has\u00a0declined to rule out\u00a0military intervention in Greenland.",
      "\"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News in March.",
      "\"There's a good possibility it could be done without military force,\" Mr. Trump said, but adding, \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said multiple times that he wants to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island nation of\u00a0Greenland, long a U.S. ally. Those remarks have been met with flat rejections from Greenland's leaders.",
      "\"Greenland is not for sale,\" Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland's representative to the U.S, said Thursday at a forum in Washington sponsored by the Arctic Institute.",
      "Time and again on Thursday, lawmakers pressed Hegseth to answer questions he has avoided for months, including during the two previous days of hearings on Capitol Hill. And frustration boiled over for some Democrats.",
      "\"You're an embarrassment to this country. You're unfit to lead,\" Rep. Salud Carbajal snapped, the California Democrat's voice rising. \"You should just get the hell out.\"",
      "Hegseth's use of Signal chats",
      "Hegseth's use of two\u00a0Signal chats\u00a0to discuss plans for U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen with other U.S. leaders as well as members of his family prompted dizzying exchanges with lawmakers.",
      "He was pressed multiple times over whether or not he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.",
      "He argued that the classification markings of any information about those military operations could not be discussed with lawmakers.",
      "That became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted \u2014 on strike times and munitions dropped in March \u2014 was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.",
      "\"You can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,\" Moulton said.",
      "\"What's not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,\" Hegseth responded.",
      "A Pentagon watchdog report on Hegseth's Signal use is expected soon.",
      "Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general finds that he placed classified information on Signal, a commercially available app.",
      "Hegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves \"at the pleasure of the president.\""

    "summary": "Three Democratic governors defended their responses to the migrant crisis\u200b and dispute claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities, according to remarks prepared for a congressional panel.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Three Democratic governors defended their states' policies toward\u00a0migrants\u00a0and disputed claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities Thursday in testimony before a House panel that at times grew heated.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about so-called \"sanctuary policies\" as protests against the Trump administration's efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement throughout the country. Republicans accused the governors of stonewalling those operations and criticized state and local sanctuary policies that prevent cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Let me be clear: Sanctuary policies do not protect Americans. They protect criminal illegal aliens,\" Oversight Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican said in his opening statement.",
      "The governors' appearances come as President Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0remain embroiled in a legal and political standoff\u00a0over the deployment of the National Guard troops and Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\u00a0Demonstrations have spread to other U.S. cities, including New York and Chicago, following a series of deportation raids.",
      "The hearing",
      "Comer claimed state and local officials are \"actively undermining federal immigration enforcement,\" saying legislative action is needed to \"stop this subversion and stop the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Despite President Trump's efforts to secure the border and enforce the law, Democrat-run sanctuary cities and states are siding with illegal aliens,\" Comer said. \"For today's Democrat Party, it seems unlimited illegal immigration isn't a failure of policy \u2014 it is the policy.\"",
      "The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, rebuked the Trump administration for its response to protests in L.A. in his opening statement, calling it \"thuggery.\"",
      "\"This is wrong. Deploying the military against a civilian population is wrong,\" Lynch said. \"If we don't step up and declare what is right under our Constitution, then other cities, other citizens, will meet this same fate.\"",
      "Walz pushed back on the premise of the hearing in his opening statement, saying \"nothing Minnesota has done to serve its own people stands in the way of the federal government managing border security and policies.\" And he noted that \"while you've convened this hearing to explore the issue of so-called sanctuary states, Minnesota is not even a sanctuary state.\"",
      "The Minnesota governor said that enforcing immigration law \"is not the role of local and state governments,\" saying \"it's the federal government's job to secure the border.\"",
      "The former vice presidential candidate has drawn intense scrutiny not only over immigration policy but also for his handling of social justice protests that broke out in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd in 2020. At the time, Walz made the controversial decision to deploy the state's National Guard.\u00a0Trump administration officials have cited Walz' actions\u00a0to justify the president's decision to federalize troops in California, and Republicans on the panel repeatedly invoked his handling of the 2020 protests during Thursday's hearing.",
      "Ahead of the session, the GOP-led panel released a video compilation\u00a0of various news clips accusing the governors of \"shielding\" undocumented immigrants and \"causing chaos\" in their states.",
      "A memo from Hochul's office suggested the hearing could be \"derailed by wild accusations\" and \"twisted characterizations\" but noted the governor's position is \"clear\" when it comes to supporting strong borders and comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "Hochul addressed the influx of more than 220,000 migrants to New York City since early 2022, many of whom were bussed from border states, in her opening statement. \"New York has managed an unprecedented immigrant influx because of a broken border,\" she said, adding that \"at the same time, our state has become stronger and safer.\"",
      "\"My views on immigration are simple and direct,\" Hochul said. \"Our nation needs secure borders. Our nation needs comprehensive immigration reform from this body. And our state laws dictate that we cooperate with ICE in criminal cases, and our values dictate that we treat all law-abiding people with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Pritzker said Illinois also stepped up to the challenge, and blamed the lack of federal intervention and cooperation from border states for exacerbating the problem.",
      "\"Illinois follows the law, but let me be clear, we expect the federal government to follow the law, too,\" Pritzker said. \"We will not participate in abuses of power.\"",
      "The Illinois governor said \"it's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement just to inflame a situation and create a crisis,\" Pritzker said.",
      "The hearing featured a handful of heated moments between the Democratic governors and Republican lawmakers. GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York grilled Hochul over what the two agreed were \"horrific crimes\" that occurred in the state. Stefanik claimed they came as a result of \"Kathy Hochul's failed policies.\" Hochul accused Stefanik of \"going after the viral moment\" with her line of questioning.",
      "House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, criticized Walz for what he said is\u00a0 \"dangerous inflammatory rhetoric\" about ICE. And he accused the Minnesota governor of \"handcuffing law enforcement.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is all too familiar, by the way, with the chaos that ensues when you refuse to work with law enforcement to enforce the law,\" Emmer said.",
      "Congressional focus on \"sanctuary\" polices",
      "Thursday's session follows a March hearing on sanctuary cities\u00a0with four Democratic mayors: Eric Adams, of New York, Mike Johnston of Denver, Brandon Johnson of Chicago and Michelle Wu of Boston.",
      "Comer launched an investigation in January into \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" including states, counties or cities, to examine their impact on public safety and federal immigration enforcement.",
      "President Trump has vowed to crack down on localities that don't back his immigration agenda.",

      "Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge in Maryland on Thursday to sanction Trump officials with severe fines and other penalties for what they said was an \"egregious\" defiance of court orders.",
      "The attorneys said the Trump administration misleadingly told a judge for months that it could not retrieve Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where authorities mistakenly deported him in March. But the administration's decision to return him to the United States to face criminal charges in Tennessee last week proved they had the power all along to bring him back, the attorneys argued.",
      "\"The Government\u2019s defiance has not been subtle,\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"It has been vocal and sustained and flagrant.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's family sued the Trump administration in March after the Salvadoran man, who entered the country illegally around 2012 and was living in Maryland, was abruptly deported to a Salvadoran terrorist prison.

      "The Trump administration responded by asserting various privileges instead of handing over the discovery and repeatedly told the court it could not return him.",

      "If you're wondering whether your smart TV, streaming box, projector or tablet could be part of the BadBox 2.0 botnet, here are some warning signs and checks you can do.",
      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.Tap your profile icon >\u00a0Settings >\u00a0About.Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",

      "3. Suspicious behavior or strange apps:\u00a0Look for unfamiliar apps you didn't install, apps labeled with foreign characters or alternative app stores on your device. BadBox-infected devices often come with shady apps preloaded.",
      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",
      "6. The device came with outdated or unofficial firmware:\u00a0If your device doesn't receive software updates or has a strange update process, that's another potential sign it's not legit or may be compromised.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protecting your devices starts with powerful antivirus protection.

A trusted antivirus app can help detect hidden threats, block malicious traffic and warn you about suspicious behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "One of the most noticeable changes this year is Apple\u2019s decision to unify the naming across all its platforms. Instead of traditional version numbers, Apple is now using the year after release as the version name. So the new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.",

      "Top tips to protect your iPad from hackers and malware",
      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",
      "CAN IPHONE TEXTS HAVE MALWARE? SPOT & AVOID SMS SCAMS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",

      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",

      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security.

      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",

      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

    "summary": "E-BAR, MIT&apos;s mobile robot, provides physical support for seniors with handlebars that follow from behind, helping prevent falls while maintaining dignity for aging adults.",
    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "An individual demonstrating the E-BAR. (MIT)",
      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices. As the technology improves, it could change the way we think about caring for older adults, making everyday life safer and a bit easier for everyone involved.",

      "He had the sentence vacated in October by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which determined that it was based on calculations of a greater loss to his victims than was actually suffered\u00a0\u2014 and thus was too lengthy.",

      "The 14-year sentence was initially handed down after he pleaded guilty in 2022 to four counts of wire fraud and one count of obstructing IRS administration for stealing settlement money from multiple clients.",
      "It came despite Avenatti not reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors; he said he wanted to be accountable and spare his family further embarrassment.",

      "In 2020, the IAEA found man-made particles of enriched uranium at three sites, including Varamin, Marivan and Turquzabad. The locations were previously utilized in Iran\u2019s nuclear program and gave the agency credence to believe Tehran had once again turned to deadly nuclear ambitions.",
      "\"Since then, we have been seeking explanations and clarifications from Iran for the presence of these uranium particles, including through a number of high-level meetings and consultations in which I have been personally involved,\" Grossi said. \"Unfortunately, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the Agency\u2019s questions.",

They have recruited more than 500 researchers across all 50 states to write op-eds for local news outlets, to be published over the next week. The idea, said Emma Scales, a Cornell doctoral student involved in the effort, is to have scientists introduce themselves to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s speaking to people who are angry about not knowing where their money is going,\u201d Scales said. \u201cLike, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m one of those people using your money. I\u2019m sorry that we haven\u2019t talked, but let me tell you what I do.\u2019\u201d",

Stand Up for Science, a new nonprofit, is planning a series of demonstrations at state fairs and farmers markets, along with teach-ins at churches and open lab days this summer.

      "Some online commenters were sympathetic, Di Tomassi said, but one person insisted that the cuts had stopped \u201cstupid research,\u201d and many others expressed confusion as to what universities were even studying. Few seemed to see the value in their work.",

      "But that\u2019s exactly the point, Di Tomassi said: bridging the disconnect between what the scientific community knows and what the average person understands. Even mundane-sounding experiments can help fuel medical and scientific breakthroughs, she said.",
      "Researchers have signed up to write about breast cancer metastasis, how memories are formed and sustainable grape-harvesting, among other things.

      "Xue reminded them to avoid jargon and make it personal. She plans to write for a newspaper in her hometown of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, about how a high school internship got her interested in microbiology.",

But there\u2019s a downside to that approach, she said. \u201cI think a lot of people haven\u2019t met scientists and don\u2019t know a lot about what we do and why, which means it\u2019s easy to distrust science as a whole.\u201d",
      "Recent polling backs up her point. While 76% of Americans have confidence in scientists, that\u2019s down from 87% in 2020, surveys by the Pew Research Center show. Pew also found a majority of Americans believe that scientists are not good communicators, and that nearly half think scientists view themselves as superior to others.",

      "In response to questions about research cuts, White House spokesman Kush Desai said they were in line with what voters want. \u201cThe American people gave President Trump a resounding mandate to realign government spending to better reflect their priorities,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe Administration is committed to delivering on this mandate.\u201d",
      "For her new book, \u201cThe Salmon Cannon and the Levitating Frog,\u201d Carly Anne York, an animal behaviorist at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, profiled a handful of scientists who have engaged directly with disparagers to defend their research.",

      "So will the McClintock Letters or other campaigns work? Students and faculty members planning to participate aren\u2019t sure, but many say that\u2019s not the only goal \u2014 and hope they go further.",

In several cases, the TTP linked the app developers to a prominent Chinese cybersecurity company, Qihoo 360, which is under U.S. government sanctions.",

      "VPNs are primarily used to either protect a user\u2019s privacy by making it harder for a website to know who\u2019s visiting them, or to skirt around censorship measures. But unless a VPN company takes significant steps to automatically and permanently delete its users\u2019 search histories, a company is likely to keep records of its customers\u2019 internet activity.",

      "Justin Sherman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies data privacy, told NBC News that using a Chinese-owned VPN would be tantamount to handing over one\u2019s browsing history to Beijing.",
      "\u201cCapturing data via a VPN could let the Chinese government see everything from websites a person is reading that criticize the Chinese state, to the corporate databases and private portals that person might pull up (and then log into) on the internet for work,\u201d he said.",
      "The TTP, a tech-focused arm of the Campaign for Accountability, an investigative nonprofit that seeks to expose \u201ccorruption, negligence, and unethical behavior,\u201d previously published a report on Chinese VPN apps on April 1. Apple soon took down three of the apps with alleged ties to Qihoo 360: Thunder VPN, Snap VPN and Signal Secure VPN. The other apps \u2014 Turbo VPN and VPN Proxy Master, which are also available on the Google Play Store, as well as three others that Google offers \u2014 are all still available.",
      "None of the apps are listed as being developed directly by Qihoo 360. Instead, they are developed by Singapore-based companies including Lemon Seed, Lemon Clove, Autumn Breeze and Innovative Connecting. The TTP cited business filings in China that show Qihoo 360 saying it had acquired those companies in 2019, and Corporate registration documents for those companies in the Cayman Islands from March that all list the director as a Chinese citizen who is a top Qihoo 360 employee.",
      "NBC News reached out to developers listed for the 17 apps. Only two claimed not to have ties to China or Qihoo 360. Autumn Breeze, the developer of Snap VPN, which Apple previously removed but is still available on the Google Play store, told TTP it has \"no affiliation with Qihoo 360\" despite those registration documents, and claims it does not \"record, monitor, or retain any user online activity.\"",
      "\"Autumn Breeze fails to explain clear connections to the sanctioned PLA-linked entity that are detailed in publicly available documents,\" Paul told NBC News.",
      "The other is WireVPN, where an employee claimed in an email to NBC News that the company is \u201can independent service\u201d with \u201cno ties to Chinese entities or government organizations.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are neither affiliated with Qihoo 360 nor any other PRC-based enterprises, and our operations are entirely autonomous,\u201d the employee said.",
      "However, WireVPN\u2019s privacy policy makes clear that users are expected to adhere to Chinese law and bans them from \u201cViolating the basic principles established by the Chinese Constitution\u201d and \u201cViolating the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, social morality, rational morality, and socialist spiritual civilization.\u201d",
      "Qihoo 360 didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. But China Daily, a state-run newspaper, has reported that its cybersecurity clients include the Chinese military and \u201cat least eight ministries\u201d of the Chinese government. In a 2016 press release, the company seemed to indicate it was in the VPN business, saying \u201cQihoo 360 also provides users with secure access points to the Internet via its market leading web browsers and application stores.\u201d",
      "Both Apple and Google declined to address the specific apps that TTP highlighted as tied to Qihoo 360 and told NBC News that they follow U.S. laws regarding sanctions. Neither bans VPN app developers simply for following Chinese law.",
      "Peter Micek, general counsel at Access Now, a tech policy and human rights advocacy nonprofit, told NBC News that he was surprised to see the tech companies had potentially overlooked a sanctioned company offering apps under innocuous developer names.",
      "\u201cIt seems like this project has done the homework and due diligence that Apple and Google should have done, and it does seem like those ties would constitute indirect contact with, transactions with folks who are sanctioned,\u201d he said. Tech companies can sometimes face significant fines for violating sanctions, Micek said.",
      "Sanctions are put in place by the federal government as a penalty on foreign entities and individuals, preventing U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with them. They are often imposed after a foreign entity or individual is shown to have conducted some sort of condemned behavior or have links to condemned groups, such as cybercriminals or terrorist organizations. Qihoo 360 faced sanctions from the Commerce Department in 2020, which said the company could become involved in supplying materials to the Chinese military. The sanctions prevent American companies from exporting technology or software to Qihoo 360. It\u2019s not clear if app stores hosting apps tied to Qihoo could be in violation of those sanctions.",
      "The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment."

      "Four House Republicans \u2014 Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio \u2014 voted with 208 Democrats to reject the measure.

      "Protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles have triggered a flood of falsehoods and conspiracy theories online, and Russia has sought to exploit and amplify them, experts say.",
      "Russian media and pro-Russian voices have embraced right-wing conspiracy theories about the protests, including one that alleged the Mexican government was encouraging the demonstrations against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Mexico has strongly rejected the accusation \u2014 which was repeated by Trump\u2019s chief of homeland security \u2014 as utterly false.",
      "The episode illustrates how foreign adversaries are taking advantage of genuine divisions among Americans, a tried-and-true strategy in information warfare, analysts say. Right-wing American voices online are pushing the idea that the protests in Los Angeles are not what they appear and that a secret, leftist cabal tied to Democratic politicians and the billionaire philanthropist George Soros is orchestrating unrest, experts said.",
      "\u201cWe are following a playbook that we\u2019ve followed many times before. We\u2019re seeing a lot of the same tropes, even a lot of the same exact conspiracy theories that we\u2019ve seen circulate around previous protests,\u201d said Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University who studies social media disinformation. There were echoes of how falsehoods spread during the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople are, as they tend to do on social media, believing the messages that they\u2019re inclined to believe,\u201d Linvill said. \u201cAnd influencers are taking advantage of that, oftentimes with false or sort of purposefully misleading content.\u201d",
      "Right-wing users have posted baseless assertions that the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, has ties to the CIA and is orchestrating protests to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cBass is a political warlord. She\u2019s utilizing her expertise to encourage these riots\u2014to try to topple Trump & you,\u201d wrote conservative podcast host Liz Wheeler on a post on X.",

      "\u201cI liken it to the aftermath of Milton and Helene last year,\u201d Ayad said. \u201cWe have a crisis or a conflict point that is occurring, and there are numerous narratives that are being spread online that the government is somehow involved in the protests, paying protesters, or this is a deep-state plot against the United States by the CIA and other government actors,\u201d Ayad said.",
      "From the political left, narratives online have focused on how the federal government and the military were allegedly preparing to use lethal force, while right-leaning voices warned of plots to oust Trump and cause chaos in American cities, according to Ayad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like being on a seesaw, just gyrating between those two things,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, there\u2019s this giant reinforcing loop that just builds further steam as the protests continue day to day.\u201d",

Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, quickly responded, rejecting the accusation as \u201cabsolutely false\u201d but saying she was confident that the \u201cmisunderstanding will be cleared up.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Conservative and pro-Russian social media accounts cited an outdated video of the Mexican president as the basis for their claims she was fomenting protests in Los Angeles, according to NewsGuard, a fact-checking website. The video was taken from a press conference on May 24, nearly two weeks before the start of the L.A. protests.",
      "The Mexican president\u2019s remarks were taken out of context. Sheinbaum was referring to a proposed tax by the Trump administration on any income earned by Mexican immigrants that is sent on to their families in Mexico. She criticized the proposal and said at the time: \u201cIf necessary, we\u2019ll mobilize\u201d against the tax.",
      "Conservative commentator Benny Johnson then posted the May 24 clip of Sheinbaum after protests began last week in Los Angeles and wrote that she was calling for protests in the United States. The post has received 6.7 million views. At a news conference on Monday, Sheinbaum made clear her government opposes any violence associated with protests. \u201cWe do not agree with violent actions as a form of protest.\u201d",
      "An opportunity for Russia",
      "Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank\u2019s Alliance for Securing Democracy, said Russia\u2019s information operations online were embracing pro-Trump portrayals of the protests as a leftist violent assault.",
      "\u201cRussia is in effect cheering on Trump\u2019s response and suggesting that it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Schafer said. \u201cThey have certainly intimated that these protests are being staged or funded by the radical left.\u201d",
      "Russian news outlet Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Russian blogger in L.A. saying the protesters were not migrants but \u201cmilitants\u201d who arrived on buses.

Russian media outlet Pravda quoted Bout comparing the demonstrations to the 2014 Maidan protests in Ukraine against what was then a pro-Moscow government, with Bout claiming the L.A. protests were highly organized.",
      "Pravda also quoted Sergei Markov, a former adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying the United States was in the middle of a \u201ccivil war\u201d pitting coastal states against interior states.",
      "Sputnik reposted a viral image of a pallet of bricks, asking why it was near the protest sites. But fact-checkers at Lead Stories geolocated the photo to a construction site about 3,000 miles away, in New Jersey.",
      "Beijing accuses Washington of hypocrisy",
      "China, however, was taking a different tack. Instead of leaning into pro-Trump narratives and repeating right-wing conspiracy theories, Beijing portrayed America as a country in turmoil. Chinese media and pro-China voices argued the American government\u2019s response to protests in Los Angeles was \u201cheavy-handed and therefore hypocritical\u201d in light of Washington\u2019s criticisms of other countries\u2019 treatment of dissent, according to Schafer.",
      "An affiliate of China\u2019s global television network reminded viewers that then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had praised protests in Hong Kong in 2019 as a \u201cbeautiful sight\u201d but asked if the American government viewed the L.A. protests in the same way. A pro-Beijing commentator, Li Jingjing, denounced what she called U.S. interference in other countries\u2019 affairs even as it denounced protesters on its soil. \u201cUS hypocrisy at its best,\u201d she wrote in a post.",
      "The pervasive online image of the supposed pallet of bricks frequently shows up when there are street protests, according to the Social Media Lab, a research team at Toronto Metropolitan University.",

      "\u201cThe fact that these types of fake images are used isn\u2019t a coincidence. It\u2019s part of a pernicious & persistent narrative that protests against government policies are somehow inauthentic,\u201d it added.

    "story": [
      "Canadian wildfire smoke is triggering air quality alerts across the U.S. Midwest and Northeast on Thursday, as the northern nation\u2019s boreal forests continue to burn at a rate not seen except for a historic season in 2023.",
      "Smoke from the fires, along with ozone from heat, raised air pollution levels in Minneapolis, Green Bay, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, D.C., Philadelphia and New York, among other cities.",
      "The fire season is off to a roaring start in Canada. So far, about 8.6 million acres have burned, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. With the end of fire season still three months away, the area burned is already well above Canada\u2019s seasonal average, which since 1983 is about 6.5 million acres.",
      "The pace of burning in Canada is on a similar trend to 2023, which was the worst year for smoke exposure in modern U.S. history. Fire experts in Canada are concerned that the season is staged for a reprise.",
      "\u201cEveryone is on pins and needles expecting a year as bad as 2023,\u201d said Robert Gray, a Canadian wildfire ecologist based in Chilliwack, British Columbia. \u201cThe forecast for most of Canada is definitely above normal for temperatures and below normal for precipitation.\u201d",
      "By season\u2019s end, about 43 million acres burned across Canada that year.",
      "Gray said most of the smoke this year is being produced by dense boreal forest in northern parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Boreal regions typically see wildfire in May and June, when the days are long and temperatures begin to rise. What happens next depends on the weather.",
      "\u201cIt can be a quick two-week blip. The boreal starts to burn, the aspen starts to leaf out and then the weather changes,\u201d Gray said, referring to aspen trees common to these forests. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the rains and leaf-out with the aspen, it could just keep going.\u201d",
      "Parts of northern British Columbia have been mired in drought since 2022, according to the BC Wildfire Service, which predicted \u201can increased likelihood of large, challenging fires\u201d in parts of the province.",
      "Gray said the drought, low winter snowfall and an increase of \u201coverwintering\u201d fires that persist from season to season are factors that have increased the likelihood of a busy fire season.",
      "Overwintering fires continue through winter by smoldering in forest duff and peat underground, only to start up again in the spring.",
      "\u201cWe have fires that started in 2023, and they held over through the winter into 2024,\u201d Gray said. \u201cSome of the same fires have popped up this year.\u201d",
      "When northern British Columbia burns, smoke from the fires is often carried down to the U.S. by the jet stream, a ribbon of air that encircles the Northern Hemisphere at altitude and drives pressure changes and weather patterns.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty structured pattern. That doesn\u2019t change a lot. As long as central and northern B.C. are burning in the boreal, that pattern is going to deliver smoke to the central and northeast U.S.,\u201d Gray said.",
      "Sometimes that smoke will stay aloft, contributing to hazy skies but not diminishing air quality substantially on the ground. Other times, it puts people at risk.",
      "Wildfire smoke is a growing hazard across the U.S. and increasing exposure to it has chipped away at decades of air pollution progress from the Clean Air Act.",
      "Exposure to wildfire smoke can cause inflammation and weaken the immune system, particularly when its particles penetrate the lungs and the bloodstream. This pollution may increase the risk of asthma, lung cancer or other chronic lung diseases, particularly in vulnerable groups like older people, pregnant people, infants and children. Wildfire smoke is also associated with respiratory disease, preterm birth and miscarriage."

    "story": [
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcibly removed from a news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday after trying to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference related to immigration.",
      "\"I am Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,\" Padilla said to Noem, which prompted several men to physically push him out of the room. It was unclear who the men were, as several were dressed in plainclothes.",
      "Padilla's office shared a video of the incident with NBC News. The video shows Padilla being taken into a hallway outside and pushed face forward onto the ground as officers with FBI-identifying vests told the senator to put his hands behind his back. The officers then handcuffed him.",
      "President Donald Trump's immigration policies \u2014 and the administration's handling of demonstrations against those policies \u2014 have sparked an outcry in recent days. After protesters clashed with officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Friday, the president deployed members of the National Guard, and later Marines, to assist local law enforcement. Dozens of demonstrations have taken place across the country in the days that followed.",
      "Speaking to reporters later Thursday, Padilla said he was receiving a briefing from military officials when he learned Noem was in the same building and decided to join her briefing.",
      "\"I was there peacefully,\" he said. \"At one point, I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room, I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed.\"",
      "He added, \"If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they\u2019re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.\u201d",
      "DHS responded on X, falsely claiming that Padilla \"interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself.\" Noem made the same false allegation during an interview on Fox News.",
      "\"Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers\u2019 repeated commands,\" DHS said, claiming that agents \"thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.\"",
      "Before Padilla began questioning Noem, she spoke to reporters about the administration's actions, the subject of her appearance in Los Angeles. Noem said that DHS and its agencies, as well as the military, \"will continue to sustain and increase our operations in this city,\" she said.",
      "\"We are not going away,\" she said. \"We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country,\" she said, referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats.",
      "As Padilla tried to question her, Noem spoke over the senator, \"I want to say thank you to every single person,\" and he was removed from the room.",
      "The incident provoked further outrage from Democrats.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced the incident on the Senate floor. \"I just saw something that sickened my stomach \u2014 the manhandling of a United States senator. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the state's other senator, wrote on X that Padilla \"represents the best of the Senate. The disgraceful and disrespectful conduct of DHS agents, pushing and shoving him out of a briefing like that, demands our condemnation. He will not be silenced or intimidated. His questions will be answered. I\u2019m with Alex.\"",
      "Newsom said in a post on X that Padilla \"is one of the most decent people I know.\" \"This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now,\" he added.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris called the incident \"a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Padilla over the episode.",
      "\"Padilla didn\u2019t want answers; he wanted attention,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that what his Democratic colleague \"ought to be doing, in my view, is making sure that we have rational immigration policy. And Sen. Padilla, who\u2019s a nice man, sat on the sidelines for four years, watch the border completely be blown apart.\u201d",
      "The incident follows a string of arrests of Democratic elected officials related to immigration. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested last month for allegedly trespassing at an ICE facility in New Jersey. The charges were ultimately dropped, but he has sued interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba over the incident and Ricky J. Patel, a special agent in charge of the Newark division of Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "Earlier this week, Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was indicted on federal charges that stemmed from the same confrontation with law enforcement.",
      "Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan also suggested that Newsom and Bass could be arrested, too, if they interfere with federal agents."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-spar-democratic-governors-tense-immigration-hearing-rcna212324",
    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 18:29:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Tim Walz of Minnesota appeared before the House Oversight Committee amid protests around the country over ICE raids.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans clashed with three Democratic governors over immigration policies during a testy hearing Thursday that served as a broader forum for one of President Donald Trump\u2019s landmark issues amid the breakout of anti-deportation protests in California and around the country.",
      "Over the course of an hourslong hearing convened by the House Oversight Committee on so-called sanctuary state policies, Republican lawmakers repeatedly accused those three blue-state leaders \u2014 Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Tim Walz of Minnesota \u2014 of bearing responsibility for the deaths and abuse of people who were killed or assaulted by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "The three governors defended themselves, frequently and forcefully pointing out that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility \u2014 not a state one \u2014 and at times suggested that Republicans on the panel were creating a political spectacle to impress Trump.",
      "House Democrats led the criticism of Trump directly, with some calling him a \u201cgangster\u201d or a \u201cdictator\u201d and others lambasting his decision to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to maintain control of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.",
      "Conservatives have said sanctuary laws refer to policies that prevent local authorities from being compelled to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has in his second term signed multiple executive orders that target such cities and states, including one that withholds federal funds.",
      "The hearing got off to a hostile start, with Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the panel's chair, kicking off his opening statement by declaring that the three governors  \u2014 as well as other Democratic leaders \u2014 were running \u201csanctuary cities and states\u201d that were \u201csiding with illegal aliens.\u201d",
      "Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., the ranking Democrat on the committee, hit back in his own opening statement by comparing several recent ICE actions to moves conducted by the \u201cGestapo\u201d \u2014 referring to the secret police in Nazi Germany.",
      "During a particularly tense exchange, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., asked Hochul, \u201cDo you go along with the strategy from the Biden administration, which massively expanded immigration protocols that overwhelmed your city and overwhelmed your state?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe call for secure borders,\u201d Hochul interjected, prompting Donalds to retort, \u201cI never remember you calling for secure borders at all, governor.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re putting a federal problem on our laps. And know what? It gets old after a while,\u201d Hochul responded. \u201cI wish you would just do your job.\u201d",
      "At one point, Walz attempted to take a more conciliatory tone, while also pointing out that immigration enforcement remains a federal duty.",
      "\u201cNo one here wants to hear these horrific stories. But we have a job to do on limited resources,\u201d Walz said. He added that it was a mistake for Republicans to say \"that not doing ICE\u2019s job means we\u2019re not cooperating.\"",
      "\u201cNothing we do precludes them from doing their job,\u201d Walz said. \u201cWe have the responsibility of the American public to work together, and I think threatening arrests on elected officials \u2026 doesn\u2019t help any of us.\u201d (Trump has suggested he would support the arrest of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat.)",
      "The hearing also featured numerous distinctly political moments.",
      "Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is considering a run for governor of New York, is not a member of the committee, but Comer allowed several lawmakers to join in on the questioning. Stefanik used the opportunity to attack Hochul, repeatedly bringing up instances of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in the state, saying that they were emblematic of \u201cKathy Hochul\u2019s New York.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo amount of words is going to clean up your failed record, and these horrific crimes committed in the sanctuary state that you created,\u201d Stefanik said.",
      "In what at times resembled potential campaign messaging, Stefanik said, \u201cWe deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers, who doesn\u2019t put illegals first, but actually puts New Yorkers first.\" Hochul hit back by saying that Stefanik was simply \u201cgoing after the viral moment.\u201d",
      "It was just one of several examples where a questioner on Thursday\u2019s panel was running for higher office. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., is running for U.S. Senate, for example, while Donalds, as well as Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., are both running for governor in their states next year.",
      "In addition, Walz and Pritzker are viewed as potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidates. Both in recent weeks have taken steps to limit government-funded health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, a potential move to the right on the broader issue of immigration.",
      "The latter half of the hearing featured numerous Democrats seeking to introduce reports for the record documenting the forcible removal of Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a news conference in Los Angeles after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., repeatedly pressed Comer and other Republicans to commit to subpoenaing Noem.",
      "\u201cJust shut up,\u201d Comer replied, after moments of back-and-forth yelling. Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said \"Democrats can\u2019t follow the rules, can't follow the law\" as Frost continued to demand Comer's attention. The hearing took a brief recess after that.",
      "Earlier, the hearing veered off track numerous times, with Republicans using the stage to pepper the governors with questions on topics that GOP lawmakers are currently investigating or that are popular with their conservative base.",
      "At one point, Comer asked Walz if he\u2019d ever asked former Vice President Kamala Harris about former President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201ccognitive decline.\u201d",
      "Walz, who ran on the Democratic Party's 2024 ticket with Harris, replied he had not, triggering Comer to press harder.",
      "At another point, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas., asked Pritzker about whether he thought that \u201cbiological men should be able to use women\u2019s restrooms.\u201d",
      "Prtizker eventually replied, \u201cso you\u2019re admitting that this is just a political circus.\u201d",
      "The three Democratic governors also slammed Trump for calling up the National Guard to respond to the protests in California, expressing concern that the move could be replicated in other states.",
      "Pritzker said that, \"When the president of the United States is calling up your National Guard over the top of local law enforcement, saying that they don\u2019t need it, that they have things under control, it tends to have an inflaming effect on what\u2019s going on on the ground.\"",
      "Hochul, for her part, said Trump\u2019s actions \u201cabsolutely undermine the sovereignty of individual states.\u201d",
      "\u201cUndermining confidence in local law enforcement \u2014 you\u2019re basically saying that there\u2019s not a belief that the highly trained individuals of our municipal police departments ... can handle their jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an overreach of epic proportions.\""

      "\u201cWe officially rescued the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,\u201d Trump said at a White House news conference.",

    "story": [
      "The retrial of Harvey Weinstein ended abruptly Thursday when the jury foreman refused to join the deliberations on the remaining rape charge against the disgraced movie mogul.",
      "New York state Judge Curtis Farber declared a mistrial and prosecutors vowed to try Weinstein again on the charge the jury had been deadlocked on, the third-degree rape charge that accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting former actor Jessica Mann.",
      "The dramatic ending came a day after the jury announced it had unanimously found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting one woman and not guilty of assaulting another more than a decade ago. The verdicts on these two counts stand.",
      "During the five days of deliberations, the jury foreman had reported to Farber that they were having a hard time reaching a verdict and that several members had been clashing.",
      "Right before the partial verdict was unveiled Wednesday, the foreman told the court he\u2019d been threatened by another member of the panel who told him, \u201cYou know me; you going to see me outside.\u201d",
      "When the jury returned Thursday to resume deliberations on the remaining charge, the jury foreman told Farber he was done.",
      "\"Are you willing to go back in today and continue deliberations,\" Farber asked.",
      "\"No, sorry,\" the foreman replied.",
      "At that point, Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg asked for a mistrial and requested that Weinstein be retried on the rape charge again.",
      "\"If Weinstein wants to own up to the charge we can have discussion about that,\" Blumberg said. \"But we are ready to retrial for rape in the third degree.\"",
      "Weinstein defense attorney Arthur Aidala said his client had been through enough and there should be no third trial on this charge.",
      "Farber, however, scheduled a status hearing for July 2.",
      "With the proceeding over, Weinstein departed the courtroom in his wheelchair.",
      "\"Of course, Mr. Weinstein is disappointed,\" Aidala said after the proceeding. \"He has maintained his innocence from the day I met him in 2019.\"",
      "One of the male jurors, interviewed outside after the jury was dismissed, said they were split over the Mann rape allegation and that he was disappointed they couldn't reach a verdict.",
      "\"The third count was the hardest one,\" said the juror, who declined to give his name.",
      "When asked about the foreman's claim that he was threatened, the juror said, \"it wasn't as contentious as has been reported.\"",
      "\"It was a conversation,\" the juror said. \"It was an animated conversation.\"",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg called the women who testified against Weinstein courageous and said his office will continue to pursue the third degree rape charge.",
      "\"This morning, after the judge declared the jury could not reach a verdict on rape in the third degree, we immediately informed the court that we are ready to go forward to trial again on that charge,\" Bragg said during a press conference.",
      "Mann said in a statement following the mistrial that she would not back down.",
      "\u201cI will never give up on myself and making sure my voice \u2014 and the truth \u2014 is heard,\" Mann said. \"I have told the District Attorney I am ready, willing and able to endure this as many times as it takes for justice and accountability to be served. Today is not the end of my fight.\u201d",
      "Weinstein found himself on trial again after the state Court of Appeals last year overturned his landmark 2020 conviction for sexually abusing women.",
      "That trial defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn Weinstein, the Oscar-winning former chief of Miramax, into a pariah. But the appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that were not part of the case.",
      "Still, much of the evidence that resulted in Weinstein\u2019s being convicted five years ago of the third-degree rape of one woman and a first-degree criminal sex act against another woman was reintroduced at his retrial.",
      "Just as before, Weinstein pleaded not guilty to a charge of third-degree rape based on complaints by Mann, and a charge of first-degree criminal sexual act brought by former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley.",
      "But this time, Weinstein faced an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act in the alleged sexual assault of a Polish former runway model named Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denied all the charges and his lawyers insisted the sexual encounters with his three accusers were \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cconsensual\" and accused the three women of being grifters.",
      "On Wednesday, when it became clear that the jury was at loggerheads over Mann and after the foreman said he felt threatened, Farber told the lawyers he would ask the jury if they\u2019d reached a verdict on some of the counts and that he would instruct the panel to continue deliberating on any remaining charges.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Dozens of mostly young men torched homes and smashed in windows in a Northern Irish town late Wednesday, in a third night of what officials described as coordinated \u201cracist thuggery\u201d against the community\u2019s ethnic minorities.",
      "Some residents of Ballymena, about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here,\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with  attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",
      "A Bulgarian national who lives in Ballymena and asked that her identity be protected told Sky News,\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, honestly, I\u2019m scared to get out of the house,\u201d",

      "\"It is important,\" said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think tank that focuses on immigration, identity and integration, \"to draw the clearest red line between the legitimate debate about immigration policy, including numbers, the pace of change and the quality of integration, and hateful abuse and threats.\"",
      "\u201cGovernments need to manage asylum much better nationally and locally,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must challenge more forcefully those stoking hatred and socializing violence against migrants, and the platforms that let hatred run riot without impediment.\u201d",
      "Northern Ireland is no stranger to unrest, but usually between \u201cunionists\u201d \u2014 mostly Protestants who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom \u2014 and \u201crepublicans\u201d \u2014 mostly Catholics who want it to become part of the Irish Republic.",
      "Though this conflict, called \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d officially ended with a peace deal in 1998, sporadic clashes still break out between these often segregated communities and police.",
      "This week\u2019s unrest in Ballymena follows a different trend, however. Anti-foreigner sentiment has in recent years surged across the U.K. and indeed Europe and the West.",
      "As prices for food, fuel and housing rise due to inflation, and public services become squeezed, some politicians mainly on the populist hard-right have sought to blame mass immigration for putting undue stress on the system.",
      "Pro-immigration progressives argue that immigrants provide an essential net benefit to society, both bringing high-level skills and filling less glamorous but necessary jobs.",
      "Last summer, anti-immigrant violence flared across the U.K. after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "Online misinformation wrongly identified the British-born attacker as an immigrant."

      "According to the indictment, the maximum sentence for wire fraud is 20 years in prison, and 10 years for entering the secure airport areas under false pretenses. Both charges carry a maximum of three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.",
      "Alexander\u2019s sentencing is set for Aug. 25."

      "The 33-year-old geologist and Johnson, a petroleum engineer seven years her junior, were the only couple on Season 5 who tied the knot and appeared happily together at the reunion episode in October 2023.",
      "But during her conversation with Smith \u2014 which she confirmed Johnson was not aware of \u2014 Gonzalez said that the criticism the two received during their season about their lack of compatibility turned out to be accurate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to speak my truth,\u201d she began at the start of the nearly hour-long podcast episode. \u201cThis is not a session to bash anybody. But I wanted to share with the world. I\u2019ve been quiet for too long, not necessarily because I didn\u2019t have anything to speak of. More because I wasn\u2019t ready for other people\u2019s opinions and judgment. And now I\u2019m ready, and I have decided that I filed divorce against Milton.\u201d",
      "She said Johnson refused to sign divorce papers unless she also signed an NDA. TODAY.com has reached out to Johnson for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "\"That said enough for me to know that I needed to share my truth and my experience because I\u2019ve been suffering in silence,\" she said.",
      "She said she couldn\u2019t point to one reason for their separation because there was \u201ca layer of situations\u201d that made her reach her breaking point.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the age gap. I don\u2019t think it was the numbers,\u201d Gonzalez replied. \u201cI think it was a matter of emotional availability and maturity, support and communication. Maybe the internet was right. Maybe he wasn\u2019t ready for marriage. I think he wanted to be ready for marriage, but I don\u2019t really think that he was ready to be a husband.\u201d",
      "Her recent health problems led to arguments, as well. Gonzalez shared that in September 2024 she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes pain throughout the body and also fatigue.",
      "\u201cIt kind of felt (like) relief. But at the same time, a life sentence,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo say that fibromyalgia has ruined my life doesn\u2019t even come near to it.\u201d",
      "She became emotional as she spoke about Johnson not being supportive after she was diagnosed. Gonzalez said she wanted to take a medical leave of absence from her job to focus on her health, but he disagreed.",

      "Johnson has not commented about the divorce on social media. He also hasn\u2019t posted on Instagram since February 2024. His last post was a Valentine\u2019s Day tribute that featured pictures from a photoshoot with Gonzalez.",
      "The news of Johnson and Gonzalez\u2019s divorce comes a few weeks after Season 3 couple Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton shared they have broken up, too.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d is a show about a mother and her two children. But in Season 3, a father steps into the spotlight.",
      "Zion Miller (played by Nathan Mitchell) rises to the fore of the show not only as Georgia\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest, but as a father reckoning with the emotional toll his absence has taken on his daughter, Ginny.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mitchell reflects on Zion\u2019s evolution and the weighty arcs shaping the Miller family dynamic this season.",
      "One of the most powerful moments comes in therapy, where Ginny opens up about how much Zion missed in her life.",
      "To recap, Zion and Georgia met as teenagers. When she became pregnant with Ginny, his parents stepped in to care for the infant. After they requested guardianship, though, Georgia ran away. She was gone for a year but returned, beginning Georgia\u2019s longest on-again, off-again romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cIt was really cathartic,\u201d Mitchell says of Zion and Ginny's conversation. \u201cZion is someone who\u2019s always followed his own path, but he cares deeply about Ginny. That scene shows him realizing the full impact of his absence.\u201d",
      "As Ginny continues to navigate trauma, secrecy and identity, Mitchell says Zion shares the blame.",
      "\u201cIf he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d Mitchell reveals. \u201cHe finally sees what Georgia is capable of and realizes he needed to be the stable force all along.\u201d",
      "This season, Zion provides calm amid the chaos, stepping up for both Ginny and Georgia \u2014 even as Georgia faces legal trouble.",
      "\u201cGeorgia has this chaotic energy. Zion is the contrast,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s fiercer, more protective now. That\u2019s been exciting to play.\u201d",
      "The drama intensifies when Zion broaches the idea of joint custody. Mitchell hints at what\u2019s to come: \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Georgia will be open to sharing custody of Ginny with Zion,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re still in for some spicy drama.\u201d",
      "Zion\u2019s growing involvement as a father forces Georgia to confront a reality she\u2019s long resisted: that Ginny isn\u2019t hers alone.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s always felt Ginny needed to be with her no matter what,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cBut Zion\u2019s love and commitment are just as valid. The tension will come from whether Georgia can finally acknowledge that and make space for him.\u201d",
      "With Ginny making adult decisions, including an abortion, Zion\u2019s parenting style is more visible than ever: steady, open-hearted, and nonjudgmental.",
      "\u201cZion honors Ginny\u2019s autonomy,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cSometimes you need to be firm, but more often, you need to be loving and present.\u201d",
      "Still, the road ahead isn\u2019t smooth. Ginny begins to mirror Georgia\u2019s manipulative traits, raising alarms for Zion.",
      "\u201cHe fears she might internalize the wrong lessons,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cHe\u2019s encouraging her artistic side, her growth, but he\u2019s worried.\u201d",
      "Mitchell, though not a father himself, offers a message for parents: \u201cBe present. Be open. Vulnerability matters. Listen. You don\u2019t need all the answers \u2014 just care.\u201d",
      "Co-creators Sarah Lampert and Sarah Glinski echoed these themes. Glinski highlighted the therapy session between Ginny and Zion as a turning point.",
      "\u201cGinny always blames her mom, but the therapist asks, \u2018Where\u2019s your dad in all this?\u2019\u201d Glinski says. \u201cThat question shifts Ginny\u2019s perspective. She begins to hold Zion accountable too.\u201d",
      "Lampert says, \u201cThere\u2019s so much love, but also dysfunction. Zion stepping up now doesn\u2019t erase the past. But it does matter.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, Season 4 teases even more drama between Zion and Georgia. But at its heart, both parents are learning to prioritize Ginny\u2019s future, however messy that road might be."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reference because we didn\u2019t feel we had time to really explore that storyline. That could be (a) future (storyline).

      "Israel, which relies on intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance from the United States, may be in a position to take unilateral action against Tehran, the source familiar said. The sources familiar and officials were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action. The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.",
      "U.S. officials have announced that the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. And the Defense Department announced the voluntary departure of military families from locations all across the U.S. Central Command area of operations.",
      "The CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, was due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed late Wednesday without explanation. A source familiar said Kurilla had to focus on this unfolding situation.",
      "Another possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It\u2019s possible Israel\u2019s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran\u2019s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.",

      "The U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation accused Hamas of killing at least five of its Palestinian employees on Wednesday, as almost 40 other Palestinians were killed near the foundation\u2019s aid sites in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off-limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
      "Hamas still holds 53 hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Tensions are also rising between Israel and Iran, where Israel is considering taking military action in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News.",
      "Any strike would most likely be carried out without U.S. support as Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran on a deal to curtail its nuclear program.",
      "The sixth round of U.S.-Iran talks will be held Sunday in Muscat, the capital of Oman, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said Thursday in a post on X."

      "The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves. But it has warned people to stay on designated access routes and it paused delivery last week while it held talks with the military on improving safety.",

      "Additionally, three Palestinian medics were killed in an Israeli strike Tuesday in Gaza City, according to the health ministry.",
      "The medics from the health ministry\u2019s emergency service were responding to an Israeli attack on a house in Jaffa street in Gaza City when a second strike hit the building, the ministry said. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.",
      "Israel and the United States say they set up the new food distribution system to prevent Hamas from stealing humanitarian aid and using it to finance militant activities.",
      "The United Nations, which runs a long-standing system capable of delivering aid to all parts of Gaza, says there is no evidence of any systematic diversion.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid and by forcing Palestinians to relocate to just three currently operational sites.",
      "The other two distribution sites are in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, which Israel has transformed into a military zone. Israeli forces maintain an outer perimeter around all three hubs, and Palestinians must pass close to them to reach the distribution points.",
      "Hamas started the war with its terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage. They still hold 55 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.

      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, key partners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, are champions of Israeli settlement who support continuing the war in Gaza, facilitating what they call the voluntary emigration of its Palestinian population and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.",
      "They could now face asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the five countries said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich \u201chave incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights.

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Some residents of Ballymena, about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here,\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with  attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",

      "\u201cGovernments need to manage asylum much better nationally and locally,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must challenge more forcefully those stoking hatred and socializing violence against migrants, and the platforms that let hatred run riot without impediment.\u201d",
      "Northern Ireland is no stranger to unrest, but usually between \u201cunionists\u201d \u2014 mostly Protestants who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom \u2014 and \u201crepublicans\u201d \u2014 mostly Catholics who want it to become part of the Irish Republic.",

      "As prices for food, fuel and housing rise due to inflation, and public services become squeezed, some politicians mainly on the populist hard-right have sought to blame mass immigration for putting undue stress on the system.",
      "Pro-immigration progressives argue that immigrants provide an essential net benefit to society, both bringing high-level skills and filling less glamorous but necessary jobs.",
      "Last summer, anti-immigrant violence flared across the U.K. after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the town of Southport in northwest England.",

      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",
      "Men, younger people and those who view their country's right-wing populist parties favorably are more likely to have more confidence in Trump.",
      "For example, 51% of Japanese people ages 18 to 34 have confidence in Trump, according to the poll, while 31% of Japanese people 50 years or older say the same.",
      "In the United Kingdom, 45% of men say they have confidence in Trump, compared with 28% of women.",
      "Respondents across 13 nations registered a double-digit decline in confidence in the U.S. president on world affairs from 2024 to 2025. While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.",
      "The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word \"arrogant\" described Trump well.",
      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."

      "The 4-foot-tall mint-green doll, whose price included a 15% commission, was traded in Beijing on Tuesday at what was billed as the world\u2019s first auction dedicated to Labubu collectibles. Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.",
      "The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "The \u201cintense\u201d bidding showed the \u201cgrowing momentum of pop art in the auction market,\u201d Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall. Coming in third was a set from a series called \u201cThree Wise Labubu\u201d \u2014 one doll crossing its arms, one making a peekaboo gesture and one covering its mouth \u2014 that sold for more than $80,000, including commission.",
      "The success of Labubu at auction reflects the \u201cgrowing presence\u201d of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.",
      "\u201cIn a somewhat stagnant art auction market, this development is both stimulating and indicative,\u201d he told NBC News via a messaging app.",
      "Created in 2015 by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, Labubu is one of \u201cThe Monsters\u201d in his children\u2019s book series inspired by Nordic mythology. With high, pointed ears and serrated teeth, the small monster is \u201ckind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,\u201d according to Pop Mart.",
      "Labubu dolls are often sold in \u201cblind boxes,\u201d sealed packages whose contents are revealed only upon opening. In the U.S. store, one blind box from a recent collection retails for $27.99, while a set of six costs $167.94, though prices can more than double on resale sites such as eBay.",
      "The dolls have also been popularized by celebrities such as Rihanna and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink, both of whom have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags.",
      "Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Mart shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.",
      "In the first three months of this year, Pop Mart\u2019s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.",
      "As Labubu\u2019s popularity soars globally, Wang Ning, the founder of Pop Mart, became $8 billion richer from 2024 to 2025, a fivefold increase in his wealth, according to Forbes.",
      "CORRECTION (June 11, 2025, 11:40 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misidentified the Chinese retailer behind the popular Labubu products. It is Pop Mart, not Pop Market."

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez.

      "The high court rejected Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence \u201cdoes nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.\u201d",
