      "Hunter Schafer says \u201cit\u2019s important to just keep track of where things are in our country,\u201d a day after the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star posted a video in which she revealed her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Hunter Schafer says \u201cit's important to just keep track of where things are in our country,\u201d a day after the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star posted a video in which she revealed her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker.",
      "Speaking to The Associated Press on the red carpet at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, the 26-year-old actor, who is trans, said she felt \u201cit was a good, necessary point\u201d to share. Schafer, also a presenter at the award show, was nominated for best lead performance for \u201cCuckoo. \u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office instituting a new and narrow federal government definition of the sexes. As part of the order, the federal government defines sex as only male or female and says that must be reflected on official documents, like passports. The State Department, responsible for passports, is no longer issuing passports with the \u201cX\u201d marker that\u2019s been available since 2021 and is not honoring requests to change gender markers between \u201cM\u201d and \u201cF.\u201d",
      "In an 8 \u00bd-minute video posted to TikTok on Friday, Schafer, who transitioned as a young teen, said the passport that was meant to carry her well into her 30s was stolen while she was filming in Spain. After receiving an emergency passport, she later had to apply for a new, permanent one in Los Angeles. Having had female gender markers on her license and passport since she was a teenager, Schafer marked \u201cfemale\u201d on her application \u2014 but received a passport that identified her as male, she said. In the video, she said she had not had her birth certificate amended.",
      "Schafer acknowledged the executive order in her TikTok video: \u201cBecause our president, you know, is a lot of talk, I was like, \u2018I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u2019 And, today, I saw it,\u201d Schafer said, holding up her new passport page with the \u201cM\u201d marker. She said she was making the video not to \u201cfearmonger or like create drama or receive consolation,\u201d but to note the reality of the situation.",
      "\u201cI wasn't even really looking for support, but I have an amazing community around me and it's one of the greatest blessings of my life and so I felt very supported throughout, before and then now,\u201d she told the AP on Saturday.",
      "The State Department said in response to a request for comment that it was implementing Trump\u2019s executive order but declined to comment on specific cases, citing privacy laws and restrictions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't really change anything about me or my transness. However, it does make my life a little harder,\u201d Schafer said in the video, saying she has to travel for the first time with the new passport next week.",
      "\u201cTrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can't change that,\u201d she concluded.",

      "The Film Independent Spirit Awards (sometimes casually referred to as the Indie Spirits) have been celebrating the best in independent film for 40 years. For many years, the show, put on by the nonprofit organization Film Independent, took place the day before the Oscars but it\u2019s recently shifted timing away from that busy weekend.",
      "Awards are voted on by Film Independent Members, a group that includes filmmakers, industry leaders and passionate fans. The awards limit eligibility to productions with budgets of $30 million or less, meaning more expensive productions like \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d are not in the running. Television categories were added in 2021.",
      "The Spirit Awards will be held on Saturday in Santa Monica, California, in a tent next to the beach. The show begins at 5 p.m. ET.",

      "The winners will not have any impact on the Oscars, as the voting window closed earlier this week. Some years, the Spirit Awards significantly overlap with eventual Oscar winners, as in the year of \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once.\u201d Other times, it doesn\u2019t. Last year\u2019s big awards season champion \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was too expensive to qualify, and the top Spirit Awards winners were \u201cPast Lives\u201d and \u201cAmerican Fiction.\u201d"

      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "(RNS) \u2014 The winner of the 2025 Grammy Award for best new age, ambient or chant album \u2014 a category once dominated by Enya \u2014 was an album titled \u201cTriveni,\u201d meaning \u201cthe confluence of three rivers\u201d in Sanskrit, an apt description for its weaving of Vedic chants, melodic flute and cello by India\u2019s Chandrika Tandon, South Africa\u2019s Wouter Kellerman and Japan\u2019s Eru Matsumoto.",
      "The name, which is given to the meeting point of the holy Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers, said singer Tandon, came to her in one of her daily meditations.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful coincidence that our album called Triveni won the Grammy on Vasant Panchami when the Maha Prayag was going on,\u201d Tandon told RNS, referring to the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela festival held where the three rivers meet in Prayagraj, India, considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the nation. The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",
      "\u201cThink what you like, say what you like, but one has to just smile at this incredible coincidence,\u201d Tandon said.",

      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\u201cWith my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\u201d",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.5 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises.

      "The Oscars are more international than ever",
      "NEW YORK -- For many filmmakers, the Oscars are a pipe dream. But not because they think their movies aren\u2019t good enough.",
      "The Iranian director, Mohammad Rasoulof, for instance, knew his native country was more likely to jail him than submit his film for the Academy Awards. Iran, like some other countries including Russia, has an official government body that selects its Oscar submission. For a filmmaker like Rasoulof, who has brazenly tested his country\u2019s censorship restrictions, that made the Oscars out of the question.",
      "\u201cA lot of independent filmmakers in Iran think that we would never be able to make it to the Oscars,\u201d Rasoulof said in an interview through an interpreter. \u201cThe Oscars were never part of my imagination because I was always at war with the Iranian government.\u201d",
      "Unlike other categories at the Academy Awards, the initial selection for the best international film category is outsourced. Individual countries make their submission, one movie per country.",
      "Sometimes that\u2019s an easy call. When the category \u2014 then \u201cbest foreign language film\u201d \u2014 was established, it would have been hard to quibble with Italy\u2019s pick: Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Strada,\u201d the category\u2019s first winner in 1957.",
      "But, often, there\u2019s great debate about which movie a country ought to submit \u2014 especially when undemocratic governments do the selecting. Rasoulof\u2019s fellow Iranian New Wave director Jafar Panahi likewise had no hopes of Iran selecting his 2022 film \u201cNo Bears\u201d for the Oscars. At the time, Panahi was imprisoned by Iran, which didn\u2019t release him until he went on a hunger strike.",
      "Rasoulof\u2019s film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d \u2014 a movie shot clandestinely in Iran before its director and cast fled the country \u2014 ultimately was nominated for best international film. But on March 2, it will be at the Oscars representing Germany, the country Rasoulof made his home in after being sentenced to flogging and eight years in prison in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe film, to a large degree, is now a German film, both because of the distribution company and because of all the people who worked on it post-production, including myself,\u201d said Rasoulof. \u201cI\u2019m a person who\u2019s been ripped of his Iranian national identity.\u201d",
      "The Oscars are more international than ever. This year's lead nominee, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d is the most nominated non-English language film ever. It\u2019s a Mexico-set, Spanish-language film shot outside Paris \u2014 a reflection of how borderless film can be. (It's France's Oscar submission.) For the seventh year in a row, a foreign-language film has been nominated for best picture. And for the first time, in fact, there are two up for Hollywood\u2019s top prize: \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and the Brazilian drama \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "The historic 2020 win for \u201cParasite,\u201d the first non-English language best picture winner, wasn\u2019t just, as director Bong Joon Ho called it then, a victory over \u201cthe one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles.\u201d It was the sign of a tectonic shift in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. To diversify its membership, the academy has in recent years invited hundreds of overseas voters, tipping the Oscar scales. The Academy Awards have gone global.",
      "And yet the Academy Awards' marquee category for international cinema, best international film, has been continually criticized as unjust, outdated and subject to political interference. \u201cThe Oscars\u2019 international film category is broken,\u201d wrote film critic Alissa Wilkinson in 2020 for Vox. \u201cNothing short of a total overhaul of the category is order,\u201d wrote Variety critic Peter Debruge in 2022.",
      "The academy has sometimes tweaked the category, which was renamed in 2020. In 2006, the academy ruled that international submissions no longer needed to be in the language of its home country. Last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Zone of Interest,\u201d was a German-language film set at Auschwitz, but marked the United Kingdom's first best international film Oscar.",
      "To help guard the process from outside influence, the academy in 2023 specified that each country\u2019s selection committees must be at least 50% composed of \u201cfilmmakers, artists and craftspeople.\u201d But who those people are, and what their subjective sense of national identity might be, has often been questionable.",
      "This year, one of the most conspicuous absences from the Oscars is Payal Kapadia\u2019s \u201cAll We Imagine As Light,\u201d an Indian drama that numerous critics have named the best film of 2024. It was the first Indian film to play in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 30 years.",
      "The Film Federation of Indian instead chose Kiran Rao\u2019s \u201cLaapataa Ladies,\u201d a glossier comedy from Jio Studios that the academy ultimately passed on. FFI president Ravi Kottarakara told the Hollywood Reporter India that the jury, which was all male, felt \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d was like \u201cwatching a European film taking place in India.\u201d",
      "Kapadia, speaking shortly after that decision, praised the choice of \u201cLaapataa Ladies\u201d while taking issue with the jury\u2019s metric.",
      "\u201cWhat is Indian? It\u2019s a very big continent that we have,\u201d said Kapadia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Indias. I\u2019m really happy with the film they chose. It\u2019s a really nice film. I liked it a lot. But I feel like these kind of statements, I don\u2019t know what purpose they serve. The committee that made the selection was 13 men. Is that very Indian?\"",
      "Rancor over the Greek selection process led 20 filmmakers to withdraw their submissions for this year\u2019s Oscars to protest the Greece Ministry of Culture's sudden replacement of selection committee members.",
      "Renos Haralambidis, one of the filmmakers who withdrew his film, told Balkan Investigative Reporting Network: \u201cI believe that the committee that will choose which film will be nominated for the Oscars should be independent of the state, because I believe the less the state in art, the better.\u201d",
      "The question for the academy is: Does it want this annual drama in the international film category? Should governments, autocratic or not, have any say in what films are in the running for one of the most sought-after Oscars?",
      "The film academy declined to comment for this article.",
      "These are issues the Oscars have long been aware of. Sometimes, the academy has even lent a hand to a country making its first submission. That was the case when Bhutan established a selection committee so it could nominated Pawo Choyning Dorji\u2019s 2019 film \u201cLunana: A Yak in the Classroom.\u201d It surprised pundits and received an Oscar nomination, Bhutan\u2019s first.",
      "What options does the academy have? It could make its own international film selection committee, like those that exist in other categories, and remove governments completely from the process. Some have advocated for expanding the category to 10 nominees, like best picture, and doing away with the one-nation, one-movie rule. Another option: Keep the current system but allow for several academy committee-chosen slots so that political dissidents aren't ruled out.",
      "Such changes would surely be welcome news to those who believed France last year should have submitted Justine Triet\u2019s best picture-nominated legal drama \u201cAnatomy of a Fall,\u201d or India ought to have backed the Telugu-language smash \u201cRRR.\u201d Both picked up Oscars in other categories.",
      "Regardless, it\u2019s clear that geopolitics have increasingly made the best international film award at the Oscars almost as quarrelsome as the rest of our global existence.",
      "For any peace in the category, you\u2019d have to look to the Latvian entry, \u201cFlow,\u201d an animated animal parable nominated for both best international film and best animated film. While it\u2019s nominated by Latvia, it contains no language, at all, just a few meows and some barking.",

      "Monroe County Coroner Thomas Yanac confirmed her death Friday to The Associated Press, saying she died at her home in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, after a stint on hospice care. She died of natural causes.",
      "A representative for the estate of The Notorious B.I.G. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Notorious B.I.G., one of the rap\u2019s greatest performers, was shot to death at age 24 in Los Angeles in 1997. The case remains unsolved. He was survived by his wife, the musician and actress Faith Evans, and his two children, Christopher Jordan Wallace and T\u2019yanna Dream Wallace.",
      "Wallace was a dedicated keeper of the legacy of her son, born Christopher Wallace. When he first emerged on the scene as one of rap's most distinctive talents with songs that expertly detailed street life in Brooklyn, she labeled his music \u201cnoise.\u201d",
      "Since his death, his gift took on a new meaning for her. She told AP in 2017, 20 years after his death, \u201cI remembered my son said, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to my music.\u2019 And I never listened to his music. I heard it on the radio and it sounded good, because it was clean. But I said, \u2018You know what, I have to. I have to listen to that music.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I did.\"",
      "\u201cI cried so much that day just listening to the music. I remember I sat, I stood. I rested my head on the stereo and I just cried like a baby. And that was therapy for me. And I said, \u2018Oh my God \u2014 that was a talented young man to put those words together.\u2019 He had a beautiful voice. I love his voice,\u201d she continued.",
      "Wallace launched the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation following her son's death, an organization that provides educational resources for children. In 2003, she honored mothers of other musicians who died untimely deaths \u2014 Aaliyah, Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes, Tupac Shakur, Jam Master Jay, Big Pun, Big L and Freaky Tah \u2014 at \u201cB.I.G. Night Out,\u201d a benefit for the foundation.",
      "\u201cIt is our way of saying, \u2018Keep your head up,\u201d\u2019 Wallace told AP at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation\u2019s way just to let these parents know that we love them.\u201d",
      "She also took legal action on behalf of her son. In 2004, she dropped a wrongful-death lawsuit against a former suspect in the rap star\u2019s slaying \u2014 Amir Muhammad, aka Harry Billups. The 2002 lawsuit also named the city of Los Angeles and Muhammad\u2019s former college roommate, David A. Mack, a Los Angeles policeman.

      "Being cut cut from her high school basketball team was painful for Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel, but she refused to let that rejection, or being born with one arm, stop her from pursuing her basketball dreams",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- When her high school basketball coach cut her from the team senior year, Baileigh Sinaman-Daniel refused to let that rejection, or the fact she was born with one arm, end her dream of playing the game that her childhood idol LeBron James made her fall in love with 15 years ago.",
      "That determination led the 22-year-old guard at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to become the first NCAA Division III women\u2019s basketball player with one arm to score in a collegiate game, said her coach, Martin Rather.",
      "\u201cI kind of just shot the ball with the anticipation that I would have to go and get it back on a rebound,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said of the historic basket that she made from near the three-point line, which snapped the net without hitting the rim. \u201cWhen the shot actually went in, I was more so surprised.\u201d",
      "Rather immediately called a timeout to mark the moment.",
      "\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018That\u2019s history and we need to take a second to pause and celebrate it,\u2019\u201d Rather said. \u201cEverybody just swarmed Baileigh, giving her high fives, celebrating her.\u201d",
      "The Stafford, Virginia, native\u2019s path to history was sparked by a painful rejection at Mountain View High School.",
      "\u201cI had played for my high school for about three years and my senior year of high school when I tried out again, as I always did, I actually got cut and the coach basically told me that I wasn\u2019t needed on the team,\u201d she said.",
      "That led to two days of misery and crying, until she made a bold decision while sitting in her car.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, I could do this in college. What\u2019s stopping me from doing this in college?\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said. \u201cSo, I started emailing hundreds of coaches and it didn\u2019t really matter what division it was. I was just trying to get a possible maybe or even better \u2014 a yes.\u201d",
      "That persistence caught Rather\u2019s attention when Sinaman-Daniel, a 5-foot-6-inch guard, entered the transfer portal after two years at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina.",
      "At Lesley, Sinaman-Daniel has become known for her work ethic with the Lynx.",
      "She has completed more individual practice sessions than any other player on the team, which is having its best season in 14 years and has reached the playoffs, Rather said.",
      "\u201cI think any team in this country would benefit from having a player with Baileigh\u2019s heart on their team,\u201d Rather said.",
      "The achievement is particularly notable given the scarcity of one-armed players in collegiate basketball who could have served as role models.",
      "\u201cIt is not very common to see somebody with one arm playing basketball. I think there\u2019s probably about two or three of us in the collegiate level,\u201d Sinaman-Daniel said.",
      "Though there are few other notable one-armed college basketball players, the most successful is likely Hansel Emmanuel at Austin Peay, whose coach describes as \u201cthe biggest inspiration in college sports.\u201d The athletic success of the 6-foot-6 men\u2019s Division I junior, whose arm was amputated at age 6 after an accident, has proved limitations don\u2019t define potential.",
      "Since Sinaman-Daniel could not always use standard balance and ball management techniques used by two-armed players, her on-court success has required unique training methods allowing her to develop fundamental skills.",
      "\u201cTaking passes or giving a good pass or figuring out the right shooting form \u2014 I\u2019ve had to tweak and adjust,\u201d she said.",
      "Sinaman-Daniel scored her second basket on her birthday, some seven weeks after her initial score, adding another layer of satisfaction to her breakthrough season.",
      "The junior guard who was born with a tiny right arm that she is unable to use is studying psychology at the university just outside Boston and hopes her achievement will inspire others facing similar challenges.",
      "\u201cWhen people look at me, I just hope they see me as Baileigh. I hope they see me as a basketball player and also see me as somebody who\u2019s willing and able to do everything that everybody else is doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Rather sees her impact extending beyond the court.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

      "Christoph Waltz\u2019s Danny Dolinski is the one at an unwelcome crossroads in the film. He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",
      "West is an action and studio system veteran behind \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and various Jason Statham vehicles. There's lots of shoot-em-up action and bullets to the head for anyone looking for that, but not much more to hang on to. \u201cOld Guy\u201d feels very of this moment in the fact that it looks good and has a good cast and yet can\u2019t seem to deliver something that\u2019s either entertaining or meaningful. But unlike so many of its peers, this one amazingly was not made by a streamer.",
      "\u201cOld Guy,\u201d a The Avenue release in limited theaters and on VOD Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage, violence, some drug use.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Weeks before the book's release, Puchner himself received some very surprising news, from Oprah Winfrey, who told him that she had chosen \u201cDream State\u201d for her book club.",
      "\u201cI got a phone call from a number I didn't recognize,\" the author said during a recent interview. \u201cWhen the caller said she was Oprah Winfrey I nearly dropped the phone I was so baffled. I was expecting to talk to my publicist, and at first, I didn't believe her. But then she started to talk in that inimitable way.\u201d",
      "The 54-year-old author is an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who hopes the Winfrey endorsement might mark a shift from years \u201ctoiling in obscurity,\u201d wishing only that he could attract enough readers to keep writing. \u201cDream State\u201d is the fourth book from Puchner, whose previous works include the story collections \u201cMusic Through the Floor\u201d and \u201cLast Day on Earth\u201d and the novel \u201cModel Home,\u201d a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2011.",
      "Puchner's latest work, published Tuesday, is a love triangle among two old college friends and the woman they both have wished to marry. Set mostly in Montana and California, the 432-page narrative extends half a century from his characters' early years to approaching old age as all contend with their feelings for each other and how they imagine they might otherwise have turned out.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of book you won\u2019t want to put down written by a brilliant storyteller,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cSpanning fifty years, \u2018Dream State\u2019 is an exquisite examination of the important relationships we have in our lives \u2014 love, marriage, friendship \u2014 and how life can turn out so differently than we expected.\u201d",

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",

In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",

The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",

Because without this stuff, we will go to live our life separately. And it will be one day, of course, and I\u2019m kind of sad about this but it just will come.

In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.",

While just one man is in the dock \u2014 a former surgeon accused of raping or sexual abusing 299 people, mostly child patients \u2014 activists hope the trial empowers other victims and helps expose other abusers long protected by societal taboos.",

      "The trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos surrounding sexual abuse. That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of others, France\u2019s symbol of fight against sexual violence.",

      "A court battle is set to resume over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding",
      "BOSTON -- A court battle is set to resume Friday over the Trump administration\u2019s drastic cuts in medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and delay new lifesaving discoveries.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily blocked the cuts from taking effect earlier this month in response to separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries. Now U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, must decide whether to extend the temporary restraining order blocking those cuts.",
      "The states and research groups say such a move is illegal, pointing to bipartisan congressional action during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term to prohibit it.",
      "\u201cYet here we are again,\u201d attorneys argued in a court motion, saying the NIH is \u201cin open defiance\u201d of what Congress decreed.",
      "In its own written arguments, the Trump administration said NIH has authority to alter the terms after awarding grants and that Kelley\u2019s courtroom isn\u2019t the proper venue to arbitrate claims of breach of contract.",
      "States and researchers \u201chave failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury,\u201d according to the administration motion.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded more than 60,000 grants last year totaling about $35 billion. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "\u201cThe broader discussion in the media has made patients very aware and very concerned about these things,\u201d Knutter said.",
      "Oklahoma\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 6-2 against advancing a proposal to allow murder charges against women who obtain abortions, with possible punishments including the death penalty and life in prison.",

      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children&rsquo;s Home in Nairobi",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "",
      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "",

      "",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",
      "",
      "Newberry, who served about 2,000 patients, declined to be interviewed. \"I'm just retiring!\" he said in an email, adding that \"the town has chosen unconventional ways\" of recruiting a doctor.",

      "Without a town doctor, some of Newberry's former patients now have to travel to Tallahassee, about a 30-minute drive southeast of Havana. Others are seeing doctors in Quincy, about a 20-minute drive west.",

      "\"Our hope is that they'll come back when we find us a new doctor,\" Havana Mayor Eddie Bass said.",
      "",
      "Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. \"Not everybody can get to Tallahassee to get a doctor,\" she said. \"Not everybody has transportation.\"",
      "",
      "But it remains to be seen whether rent-free office space and equipment are enough to attract a doctor to Havana. The town's recruitment campaign has drawn a lot of interest from nurse practitioners, but few primary care physicians have applied for the position.",

      "Town leaders say they're holding out hope of finding a family physician, who can practice and prescribe medications independently.",

      "Smeltzer, the physician headhunter, said primary care physicians are in especially low supply.

      "",
      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients  --  qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 21:30:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

      "CARTI, Panama -- A deportee from the United States detained in a camp in rural Panama, among a hundred who refused to return to their countries, described on Saturday waiting in limbo under \u201charsh conditions\u201d and cut off from access to legal council and other rights.",
      "The Chinese deportee, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation by Panamanian authorities, spoke to the Associated Press with a hidden cellphone after being connected through a concerned relative.",
      "The woman said authorities were seizing the phones of migrants in the camp and effectively cutting them off. Migrants were from Asian nations, Russia, Afghanistan and Nepal, she said.",
      "The migrant said that people in the camp were having their personal freedoms restricted, and that migrants faced both poor conditions in the camp and a strict vigilance from guards.",
      "\"Someone follows me even when I go to the toilet,\" she said.",
      "Panamanian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the AP.",
      "The testimony comes after an uproar in Panama this week over the treatment of nearly 300 migrants who were deported from the United States and are being held in Panama as authorities return them to their own countries.",
      "It's part of a deal struck with the Trump administration in which countries like Panama and Costa Rica act as \u201cbridges,\u201d temporarily detaining deportees.",
      "Originally, the migrants were locked up in hotel rooms by authorities in the country's capital, Panama City. Panama denied that they were detained, but migrants were not allowed to leave their hotel and were guarded by police.",
      "A number of migrants help up signs reading \u201cplease help us\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "Around 40% of the migrants refused to return to their countries, many citing fear of returning. Those who are willing to return home remained at the hotel, and 13 have already been returned, according to authorities.",
      "Those who refused have been sent to a rural migrant camp the southern Darien province, near the Darien Gap a perilous jungle migrant passage between Panama and Colombia.",
      "The camp, located near a small town known as San Vicente, Metet\u00ed, was originally constructed as a migrant reception center built to address the flow of hundreds of thousands of migrants traveling north through the Darien Gap in recent years. Though much of that traffic north has since petered off.",
      "Organizations like the UN agency International Organization for Migration (IOM) said they would organize \u201csafe alternatives\u201d for where to send the migrants now being sheltered in the camp.",
      "\u201cWe do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals,\u201d the IOM wrote in a statement.",

      "The woman who spoke to the AP said she was held in a hotel for five days before being sent to the second refugee camp, and that she wanted to continue to the U.S. Upon being deported, she said she did not sign any deportation documents, a standard procedure.",
      "She said that deportees are being \u201cguarded like prisoners\u201d in the Darien camp and that she believes they are being stripped of key rights, unable to access the outside world. They have no access to outside legal assistance, she said, and have received no offers of legal advice from authorities.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's Emperor Naruhito, marking his 65th birthday Sunday, stressed the importance of telling the tragedy of World War II to younger generations, pledging to contribute to efforts to promote the understanding of history and the determination for peace as the world this year observes the 80th anniversary of the war's end.",
      "\u201cAs the memory of the war fades today, it is important that the tragic experiences and history are passed on to the generations who do not know the war,\u201d Naruhito told a news conference in a pre-recorded comments released Sunday.",

      "Naruhito, accompanied by his wife, Empress Masako, their daughter Princess Aiko and some of his younger brother's family, waved from the palace balcony at the cheering well-wishers. Later Sunday, he was to celebrate his birthday at a palace banquet.",
      "The war was fought in the name of his grandfather, then- Emperor Hirohito. Naruhito said he and Masako, who were born after the war, have learned from his parents by hearing their stories of wartime experiences and thoughts about peace. His father Akihito, who abdicated in 2019, was known for his devotion to making amends for the war, and Naruhito said he will follow his example.",
      "His concern resonates especially with that of many survivors of U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, 1945, who are worried about the lack of progress in nuclear disarmament and growing support for nuclear deterrence.",

      "Hamas is set to free six more Israeli hostages from the Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Hamas is set to free six more Israeli hostages Saturday from the Gaza Strip, but the exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is shadowed by heightened tension between the adversaries that clouds the future of the fragile ceasefire deal.",
      "As preparations moved forward Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for \u201ca cruel and malicious violation\u201d of the agreement centered on the wrong identification of a body released by Hamas.",
      "The family of Shiri Bibas said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed that the remains released overnight are those of Israeli mother of two small boys. Her body had been released by militants Friday after one set of remains handed over Thursday had been misidentified as hers but later determined to be an unidentified Palestinian woman.",
      "Three other bodies returned were confirmed as those of Bibas\u2019 sons and Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when all were taken hostage during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 in Israel and ignited the war.",
      "Israel said its tests determined that the three hostages had been killed by their captors. Hamas has claimed Lifshitz and the members of the Bibas family were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.",
      "Hamas said it would \u201cconduct a thorough review\u201d of information regarding the body and suggested that Israeli bombing of the area where hostages were held might have caused a mix-up of remains.",
      "The group\u2019s military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said it would go ahead with the release of the six Israeli hostages planned for Saturday.",
      "The dispute over the body\u2019s identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult.",
      "The six Israeli men set for release Saturday are expected to be the last living hostages freed during the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",
      "They include Eliya Cohen, 27; Omer Shem Tov, 22; and Omer Wenkert, 23. All three were abducted from a music festival during the Oct. 7 attack. Tal Shoham, 40, who was taken from the community of Kibbutz Beeri, is also set to be released.",
      "Avera Mengistu, 39, and Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, who have been held since crossing into Gaza on their own years ago, are also scheduled to be returned to Israel as part of the deal.",
      "More than 600 Palestinians jailed in Israel will be freed in exchange, the Palestinian prisoners media office said Friday. The prisoners set for release include 50 serving life sentences, 60 with long sentences, 47 who were released under a previous hostage-for-prisoner exchange and 445 prisoners from Gaza arrested since the war began.",
      "Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Hamas has said it won\u2019t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he\u2019s committed to destroying Hamas\u2019 military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries.",
      "Trump said Friday that he was \u201ca little surprised\u201d by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that\u2019s the plan that really works. But I\u2019m not forcing it. I\u2019m just going to sit back and recommend it,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza\u2019s population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.",

      "France\u2019s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and accompanying warships are in the Philippines after holding combat drills with Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea in a show of firepower that will likely antagonize China",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- France\u2019s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and accompanying warships were in the Philippines on Sunday after holding combat drills with Filipino forces in the disputed South China Sea in a show of firepower that would likely antagonize China.",
      "The Charles de Gaulle docked on Friday at Subic Bay, a former U.S. Naval base northwest of Manila, for a break after more than two months of deployment in the Indo-Pacific. The French carrier engaged with security allies for contingency readiness and to promote regional security, including with Filipino forces, navy ships and fighter jets. They held anti-submarine warfare drills and aerial combat training on Friday in the South China Sea, Philippine and French officials said.",
      "Last year, the French navy deployed a frigate for the first time to participate in a joint sail with United States and Philippine counterpart forces in and near the disputed waters. It was part of the largest annual combat exercises in years by American and Filipino allied forces. The drills, known as Balikatan (Tagalog for \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d), involved more than 16,000 military personnel.",
      "China strongly criticized the exercises then, saying the Philippines was \u201cganging up\u201d with countries from outside Asia in an obvious reference to the U.S. and its security partners, and warned the drills could instigate confrontation and undermine regional stability.",
      "France\u2019s recent and ongoing military deployments to the Philippines underscore its \u201ccommitment to regional security and the shared goal of strengthening maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Co. Xerxes Trinidad said.",
      "The Charles de Gaulle, the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the world other than those of the U.S. Navy, led a strike group that included three destroyer warships and an oil replenishment ship in its first-ever visit to the Philippines, French officials said.",
      "France has been shoring up its military engagements with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations at odds with China in the disputed waters, a key global trade and security route although it says those emergency-preparedness actions were not aimed at any particular country.",
      "China, however, has bristled at any presence of foreign forces, especially the U.S. military and its allies, which carry out war drills or patrols in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety although it has not publicly released exact coordinates of its claim other than 10 dashed lines to demarcate vaguely what it calls its territory on maps.",
      "Beijing\u2019s claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan in long-unresolved territorial standoffs. Indonesia has also figured in violent confrontations with Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the Natuna waters.",
      "Two weeks ago, Australia protested after a Chinese J-16 fighter jet released flares that passed within 30 meters (100 feet) of an Australian P-8 Poseidon surveillance jet over the South China Sea, according to Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles.",
      "The Australian military plane did not sustain any damage and no crewmember was injured in the Feb. 11 incident. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson accused the Australian aircraft of \u201cdeliberately\u201d intruding into airspace over the disputed Paracel Islands, which China and Vietnam contest.",
      "In late 2023, French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed an accord to boost military cooperation and joint engagements.",
      "France and the Philippines began talks last year on a defense pact that would allow troops from each country to hold exercises in the other\u2019s territory. French negotiators have handed a draft of the agreement to their Filipino counterparts to start the negotiations.",
      "The Philippines has also signed such status-of-forces agreements with the U.S. and Australia. A signed agreement with Japan was expected to be ratified by Japanese legislators this year for it to be enforced while talks between New Zealand and the Philippines for a similar defense pact recently concluded."

      "The exports had been halted for nearly two years after the International Chamber of Commerce sided with Iraq in an arbitration case as a long-standing dispute over the independent export of oil by the Kurdish regional government.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that it had completed the necessary procedures to restart shipments through Turkey\u2019s Ceyhan port.",

      "\u201cWe call on the regional authorities to deliver the produced quantities in line with signed contracts to ensure smooth operations,\u201d it said.",
      "Officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, have long been at odds over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "Baghdad called the move \u201csmuggling\u201d and \u201crobbery\u201d and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.",
      "The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company, while Kurdish authorities have said the practice is meant to compensate for budget transfers withheld from the Kurdish region by Baghdad.",

      "Five of Brazil\u2019s 11 Supreme Court justices will decide in the next three weeks whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and 33 others charged by the country\u2019s prosecutor-general with attempting a coup will stand trial",
      "SAO PAULO -- The fate of Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro is largely in the hands of five people.",
      "Within the next three weeks, a panel of five of Brazil\u2019s 11 Supreme Court justices will decide whether Bolsonaro and 33 others charged by the country's prosecutor-general of attempting a coup will stand trial.",
      "To expedite certain cases, including criminal ones, Brazil's top court can use one of its two five-justice panels, both of which are permanent and exclude the chief justice. Changes in each panel usually take place mostly by request or when one of its members becomes chief justice. In Brazil, the chief justice serves for two years.",
      "As rapporteur of the cases against Bolsonaro, Justice Alexandre de Moraes was authorized to bring them before the panel he sits on.",
      "The 5-judge panel that could decide Bolsonaro's future excludes the two justices he appointed: Andr\u00e9 Mendon\u00e7a and K\u00e1ssio Nunes Marques. They sit on the other panel of the court.",
      "Bolsonaro's lawyers have said that they want the decision to fall on the full-court, not just on the 5-justice panel. But that decision can only be made by de Moraes, as the rapporteur of the case, or by three of the justices in the panel \u2014a majority.",
      "If the charges are accepted, that same panel could become the main judicial body to hear Bolsonaro's defense, witness testimony and sentencing.",
      "Brazil's legal experts are split on whether to keep the trial within the 5-justice panel, so it doesn't drag into the 2026 presidential election, or to move for a full-court decision, which would carry greater authority.",
      "Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, says it is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d that the panel will reject the charges against Bolsonaro, though this does not guarantee a guilty verdict.",
      "The former President denies any wrongdoing in all five counts against him and has claimed that he is being politically persecuted.",
      "Here are the judges set to decide whether Bolsonaro will be on trial and likely rule on the case:",
      "De Moraes is the rapporteur of the cases against the former president in the court and also a target of Bolsonaro and his allies. Appointed by former president Michel Temer in 2017, de Moraes is regarded as a conservative member of the court who, unlike his peers, has experience as public security secretary. The 56-year-old justice was also targeted by billionaire Elon Musk, who advocated for nis impeachment for alleged judicial overreach.",
      "L\u00facia, who is also the chairwoman of Brazil's top electoral court, was appointed by Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2006 during his first term. Since then, the 70-year-old justice has been considered one of the harshest on the court on criminal cases, including those once aimed at the current president. L\u00facia has often followed de Moraes in her decisions regarding democratic guardrails. Two years ago, she wrote in one of her rulings that Bolsonaro didn't respect the presidency.",
      "Zanin is the chairman of the panel. The 49-year-old was Lula's attorney between 2013 and 2023, when he was appointed by the leftist leader to the country's top court. Zanin's work helped overturn Lula's graft conviction at the Supreme Court, allowing him to leave jail and defeat Bolsonaro in the 2022 election. He was a critic of judicial overreach during the sprawling Car Wash corruption probe, which put Lula behind bars for almost one year.",
      "A former federal judge who transitioned to politics before being appointed to Brazil's top court, Dino, 56, is the latest justice to take his seat. He was appointed by Lula in 2023 after serving as his justice minister. He was on that job when Bolsonaro supporters trashed government buildings on Jan. 8, 2023, which the country's prosecutor-general says was part of a plan to return the far-right leader to the presidency. Dino has been a Bolsonaro critic for years.",
      "Fux, regarded by his peers as a moderate, was appointed in 2011 by then President Dilma Rousseff. The 71-year-old had a difficult relationship with the Bolsonaro presidency during his time as chief-justice between 2020 and 2022, particularly with respect to matters regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. When he left the position, shortly before the latest presidential election, he said the court was targeted daily by \u201chostile words or undemocratic acts.\u201d He often follows de Moraes' decisions.",

      "Officials in Cambodia say a rocket-propelled grenade believed to be more than 25 years old has detonated and killed two cousins, a girl and a boy both 2 years old",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- A rocket-propelled grenade believed to be more than 25 years old killed two cousins, a girl and a boy both 2 years old, when it blew up Saturday near their homes in rural northwestern Cambodia, officials said.",
      "The accident happened in Siem Reap province\u2019s Svay Leu district, where there had been heavy fighting in the 1980s and 1990s between Cambodian government soldiers and rebel guerrillas from the communist Khmer Rouge. The group had been ousted from power in 1979.",
      "Muo Lisa and her male cousin, Thum Yen, lived in neighboring homes in the remote village of Kranhuong. Their parents were doing farm work when the two toddlers apparently came across the unexploded ordinance and it detonated. Experts from the Cambodian Mine Action Center determined afterwards from fragments that it was a rocket-propelled grenade.",
      "Old unexploded munitions are especially dangerous because their explosive contents become volatile as they deteriorate.",
      "\u201cTheir parents went to settle on land that was a former battlefield, and they were not aware that there were any land mines or unexploded ordinance buried near their homes,\u201d CMAC Director-General Heng Ratana said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity because they were too young and they should not have died like this.\"",
      "Some 4-6 million land mines and other unexploded munitions are estimated to have littered Cambodia\u2019s countryside during decades of conflict that began in 1970 and ended in 1998.",
      "Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia, nearly 20,000 people have been killed and about 45,000 injured by leftover war explosives. The number of casualties has declined over time; last year there were 49 deaths.",
      "\u201cThe war is completely over and there is fully peace for more than 25 years, but the blood of the Khmer (Cambodian) people continues to flow because of the remnants of land mines and ammunition,\u201d Heng Ratana said on his Facebook page.",
      "Cambodian deminers are among the world\u2019s most experienced, and several thousand have been sent in the past decade under U.N. auspices to work in Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s demining efforts drew attention earlier this month, when U.S. financial assistance for it in eight provinces was suspended due to President Donald Trump's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Heng Ratana said Thursday he had been informed that Washington had issued a waiver allowing the aid \u2014 $6.36 million covering March 2022 to November 2025 \u2014 to resume flowing.",

      "A growing number of migrants who once hoped to reach the U.S. have begun a \u201creverse flow\u201d back to their countries of origin due to a tightening of immigration policy under U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Many of those migrants waited for months, sometimes more than a year, to apply for formal asylum in the U.S. using the Biden-era CBP One app. Those hopes were washed away when Trump took office and immediately closed down the app.",
      "Panama has not shared figures on how many migrants in the \u201creverse flow\u201d pass through the country per day, but in neighboring Costa Rica, an official told The Associated Press this week they were seeing between 50 and 75 new migrants traveling south daily.",
      "With few resources or ways to get home, many South American migrants have started to travel home to their Andean countries with the help of smugglers. They often use small, motorized boats that travel through the Guna Yala, an archipelago with hundreds of small islands in the Caribbean.",
      "The boats often make trips between nearby coastal communities in Colombia and Panama.",
      "One pair of migrants who spoke to AP said they wanted to take the marine route because it was safer than traveling through the perilous jungled trenches of the Darien Gap, which divides Panama and Colombia.",
      "Smugglers once raked in money when migration flows north were heavy more than a year ago, and continue to make a smaller profit on migrants traveling back.",
      "Panama\u2019s National Coastal Service said in a statement that Saturday's boat capsizing was due to heavy swells in the archipelago. Border police and villagers were carrying out search and rescue efforts.",
      "Meanwhile, dozens of other migrants were being transported on Saturday to Guna Yala to begin their return by sea."

      "As Ukraine approached the three-year mark of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, the country\u2019s hoped-for path to a favorable and lasting peace has been upended in a matter of days by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- As Ukraine approached the three-year mark of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, the country\u2019s hoped-for path to a favorable and lasting peace was upended in a matter of days by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Kyiv had benefited from years of staunch support by its allies in the United States and Europe which had provided crucial military and financial support to help defend against Moscow\u2019s grinding incursions.",
      "But when Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week \u2014 undoing years of U.S. policy to isolate the Russian leader over his aggression \u2014 it was taken as a signal in Kyiv and other European capitals that their alliance to contain Moscow was fraying.",
      "Here\u2019s a timeline of events:",
      "On their 90-minute call, Trump and Putin agreed to begin negotiations to end the war, a move that was met with jubilation in Russia but which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned would be \u201c very dangerous \" if Ukraine were excluded from talks.",
      "Although Trump spoke to Zelenskyy immediately after the Putin call, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that day that NATO membership for Ukraine, something Kyiv believes would protect the country and Europe from future Russian attacks, was unrealistic. He suggested Ukraine should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back, a perspective that is remarkably close to Moscow\u2019s.",
      "The breakneck speed of Trump's transformation of U.S. policy toward Ukraine and Russia left many war-weary Ukrainians feeling that they were being left out of the conversation on their future, and fearing that a deal forced by Washington and Moscow would result in lost territory and vulnerability to future Russian aggression.",
      "European leaders had their first chance to meet with members of the new Trump administration at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where they hoped to gain clarity on Trump's approach to the war.",
      "But leaders were stunned as senior U.S. officials including Vice President JD Vance lambasted European nations, gave mixed signals on support for Kyiv and suggested Europe would not be at the table for negotiations on Ukraine.",
      "During highly anticipated talks between Vance and Zelenskyy in Munich, the Ukrainian leader told Vance that his country needed security guarantees as a precondition for engaging in any talks with Moscow to end the war.",
      "Zelenskyy also said he'd ordered his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the United States access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, a key part of his talks with Vance. Ukrainian officials said the U.S. proposal did not offer any specific security guarantees in return for access to Ukraine\u2019s vast reserves of critical minerals that are used in the aerospace, defense and nuclear industries.",
      "A senior White House official described Zelenskyy\u2019s refusal as \u201cshort-sighted.\u201d",
      "On the final day of the conference, French President Emmanuel Macron began rallying European leaders to fortify their support for Ukraine, with his foreign minister announcing an emergency \u201cworking meeting\u201d in Paris to assess the continent's next steps.",
      "Meanwhile, amid concerns that U.S. support for Kyiv was faltering, a group of European countries was quietly working on a plan to send troops into Ukraine to help enforce any future peace settlement with Russia.",
      "U.S. and Russian officials met for talks in Saudi Arabia's capital, sidestepping Kyiv and its European backers. The two countries agreed to work together to end the war in Ukraine and to improve diplomatic and economic ties, an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Yet the three U.S. principals at the meeting in Riyadh \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Trump's special Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff \u2014 maintained that the four-hour discussion was aimed mainly at assessing Russia's seriousness about wanting a peace deal.",
      "All three said publicly that no specific proposals had been put on the table, and that it remained to be seen if the Russians were willing to negotiate in good faith.",
      "They also rejected assertions that either Ukraine or the Europeans were being excluded, noting that although they weren't present in Riyadh, Trump, Vance and Rubio had all spoken with both Zelenskyy and European officials who would be involved if and when peace talks actually start.",
      "Zelenskyy dismissed the talks, saying they would \u201cyield no results\u201d in the absence of Ukrainian participation. He postponed a plan to visit Riyadh the next day to avoid any linkage of his trip with the U.S.-Russia meeting.",
      "Trump showed little patience for Kyiv's objections to being sidelined in Riyadh, and ramped up inflammatory rhetoric that caused anger and alarm in Ukraine and seemed to contradict the assurances that Rubio, Waltz and Witkoff had endeavored to provide.",
      "Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump made the jarring suggestion that Ukraine itself was responsible for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives, and criticized Zelenksyy for Ukraine delaying elections because of the invasion, in accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution.",
      "Trump's comments, and a Wednesday post on social media that called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator,\u201d led to Zelenskyy saying that some of the president's claims were \u201cdisinformation\u201d that originated in Russia, and that he would like Trump\u2019s team \u201cto be more truthful.\u201d",
      "Trump, Zelenskyy said, is living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\u201d",
      "As relations between the two leaders eroded, one thing remained on the horizon that some observers thought could serve to lower the temperature on the disagreements between Washington and Kyiv: Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, arrived in Ukraine's capital by train Wednesday morning for discussions with Zelenskyy and other officials.",
      "Kellogg has long been Trump\u2019s top adviser on defense issues. He was due to speak with Zelenskyy about Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war, and the Ukrainian leader had previously said he looked forward to explaining what was happening in Ukraine to Kellogg and accompanying him to see the front line.",
      "A news conference that was set to follow a meeting between Zelenskyy and Kellogg was abruptly cancelled at the request of the U.S. delegation.",
      "In a complimentary gesture that stood in stark contrast with the tone of the preceding days, Kellogg wrote on X that he'd had a \u201clong and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "He said he'd had positive discussions with \"the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump continued to lay into Zelenskyy, grumbling that a visit to Kyiv last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was \u201ca wasted trip\u201d after the Ukrainian side declined to agree to a U.S. proposal to procure profits on rare earth minerals.",
      "At the same time, Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, expressed confidence that Zelenskyy would seal a rare earths deal. \"Here\u2019s the bottom line. President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "Trump, speaking to \u201cThe Brian Kilmeade Show\u201d on Fox News radio, also dismissed Zelenskyy's complaints about not being included in the Saudi talks. He voiced certainty that Putin wanted to strike a deal.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to make a deal,\" Trump said of Putin. \u201cBecause if he wanted, he would get the whole country.\u201d",

      "The Front for the Liberation of Azawad, the Tuareg independence movement in the north of the country, accused soldiers and Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group of intercepting two civilian transport vehicles bound for Algeria from Gao on Monday, and \u201ccoldly executing\u201d at least 24 people among the passengers.",

      "The Vatican says Pope Francis is in critical condition after he suffered a long asthmatic respiratory crisis that required high flows of oxygen",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis was in critical condition Saturday after he suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection, the Vatican said.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who remains conscious, received \u201chigh flows\u201d of oxygen to help him breathe. He also received blood transfusions after tests showed low counts of platelets, which are needed for clotting, the Vatican said in a late update.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Father\u2019s condition continues to be critical, therefore, as explained yesterday (Friday), the pope is not out of danger,\u201d the statement said. It was the first time \u201ccritical\u201d had been used in a written statement to describe Francis' condition since he was hospitalized Feb. 14.",
      "The statement also said that the pontiff \u201ccontinues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair although in more pain than yesterday.\" Doctors declined to offer a prognosis, saying it was \u201creserved.\u201d",
      "Doctors have said Francis' condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.",
      "They have warned that the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia. As of Friday, there was no evidence of any sepsis, and Francis was responding to the various drugs he is taking, the pope\u2019s medical team said in their first in-depth update on the pope\u2019s condition.",
      "Saturday's blood tests showed that he had developed a low platelet count, a condition called platelopenia or thrombocytopenia. Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal. Low platelet counts can be caused by a number of things, including side effects from medicines or infections, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.",
      "Francis, who has chronic lung disease and is prone to bronchitis in winter, was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened.",
      "Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs. They prescribed \u201cabsolute rest\u201d and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when he needs it. Saturday's update marked the first time the Vatican has referred to Francis suffering an \u201casthmatic respiratory crisis of prolonged magnitude, which also required the application of oxygen at high flows.\u201d",
      "Dr. Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital, said Friday the biggest threat facing Francis was that some of the germs that are currently located in his respiratory system pass into the bloodstream, causing sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.",
      "\u201cSepsis, with his respiratory problems and his age, would be really difficult to get out of,\u201d Alfieri told a news conference Friday at Gemelli. \u201cThe English say \u2018knock on wood,\u2019 we say \u2018touch iron.\u2019 Everyone touch what they want,\u201d he said as he tapped the microphone. \u201cBut this is the real risk in these cases: that these germs pass to the bloodstream.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows he's in danger,\u201d Alfieri added. \u201cAnd he told us to convey that.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Vatican hierarchy went on the defensive to tamp down rumors and speculation that Francis might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated. Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision. The pope remains fully conscious, alert, eating and working.",
      "The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to speculation and rumors about a possible resignation. It came after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope\u2019s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret. Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican flat-out denied that any such meeting occurred.",
      "Parolin said such speculation seemed \u201cuseless\u201d when what really mattered was the health of Francis, his recovery and return to the Vatican.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, I think it is quite normal that in these situations uncontrolled rumors can spread or some misplaced comment is uttered. It is certainly not the first time it has happened,\u201d Parolin was quoted as saying. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think there is any particular movement, and so far I haven\u2019t heard anything like that.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday that President Donald Trump had been briefed on the pope\u2019s condition and was working on his own statement that will be released later.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re praying for the pope,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says Leavitt and two others are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",
      "Deacons, meanwhile, were gathering at the Vatican for their special Holy Year weekend. Francis got sick at the start of the Vatican\u2019s Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration of Catholicism. This weekend, Francis was supposed to have celebrated deacons, a ministry in the church that precedes ordination to the priesthood.",
      "In his place, the Holy Year organizer will celebrate Sunday\u2019s Mass, the Vatican said. And for the second consecutive weekend, Francis will skip his traditional Sunday noon blessing, which he could have delivered from Gemelli if he were up to it.",
      "\u201cLook, even though he's not (physically) here, we know he's here,\u201d said Luis Arnaldo L\u00f3pez Quirindongo, a deacon from Ponce, Puerto Rico, who was at the Vatican on Saturday for the Jubilee celebration. \u201cHe's recovering, but he's in our hearts and is accompanying us, because our prayers and his go together.\u201d",

      "The suspect arrived in France without papers in 2014, and was arrested and convicted of glorifying terrorism in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, Retailleau said. Police experts had \u2033detected a schizophrenic profile\u2033 in the suspect, he added.",

      "An ancient trading post known for housing some of West Africa's most historically significant manuscripts could soon be covered by the Sahara Desert",
      "CHINGUETTI, Mauritania -- For centuries, poets, scholars and theologians have flocked to Chinguetti, a trans-Saharan trading post home to more than a dozen libraries containing thousands of manuscripts.",
      "But it now stands on the brink of oblivion. Shifting sands have long covered the ancient city's 8th-century core and are encroaching on neighborhoods at its current edge. Residents say the desert is their destiny.",
      "As the world's climate gets hotter and drier, sandstorms are more frequently depositing inches and feet of dunes onto Chinguetti's streets and in people\u2019s homes, submerging some entirely. Tree-planting projects are trying to keep the invading sands at bay, but so far, they haven\u2019t eased the deep-rooted worries about the future.",
      "Chinguetti is one of four UNESCO World Heritage sites in Mauritania, a West African nation where only 0.5% of land is considered farmable. In Africa \u2014 the continent that contributes the least to fossil fuel emissions \u2014 only Somalia and Eswatini have experienced more climate change impacts, according to World Bank data.",
      "Mauritanians believe Chinguetti is among Islam\u2019s holiest cities. Its dry stone and mud mortar homes, mosques and libraries store some of West Africa\u2019s oldest quranic texts and manuscripts, covering topics ranging from law to mathematics.",
      "Community leader Melainine Med El Wely feels agonized over the stakes for residents and the history contained within Chinguetti's walls. It's like watching a natural disaster in slow motion, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a city surrounded by an ocean of sand that\u2019s advancing every minute,\u201d El Wely, the president of the local Association for Participatory Oasis Management, said. \u201cThere are places that I walk now that I remember being the roofs of houses when I was a kid.\u201d",
      "He remembers that once when enough sand blew into his neighborhood to cover the palms used to make roofs, an unknowing camel walking through the neighborhood plunged into what was once someone\u2019s living room.",
      "Research suggests sand migration plays a significant role in desertification. Deserts, including the Sahara, are expanding at unprecedented rates and \u201csand seas\u201d are being reactivated, with blowing dunes transforming landscapes where vegetation once stood.",
      "\u201cWhat we used to think of as the worst case scenario five to 10 years ago is now actually looking like a more likely scenario than we had in mind,\u201d said Andreas Baas, an earth scientist from King\u2019s College London who researches how winds and the way they blow sand are changing.",
      "More than three-quarters of the earth\u2019s land has become drier in recent decades, according to a 2024 United Nations report on desertification. The aridity has imperiled ability of plants, humans and animals to survive. It robs lands of the moisture needed to sustain life, kills crops and can cause sandstorms and wildfires.",
      "\u201cHuman-caused climate change is the culprit; known for making the planet warmer, it is also making more and more land drier,\u201d the U.N. report said. \u201cAridity-related water scarcity is causing illness and death and spurring large-scale forced migration around the world.\u201d",
      "Scientists and policymakers are mostly concerned about soils degrading in once-fertile regions that are gradually becoming wastelands, rather than areas deep in the Sahara Desert.",
      "Still, in Chinguetti, a changing climate is ushering in many of the consequences that officials have warned about. Trees are withering, wells are running dry and livelihoods are vanishing.",
      "Date farmers like 50-year-old Salima Ould Salem have found it increasingly difficult to nourish their palm trees, and now have to pipe in water from tanks and prune more thoroughly to make sure it's used efficiently. Salem's neighborhood used to be full of families, but they\u2019ve gradually moved away. Sand now blocks the doorway to his home. It's buried those where some of his neighbors once lived. And a nearby guesthouse built by a Belgian investor decades ago is now half-submerged in a rippling copper-hued dune.",
      "Though many have departed, Salem remains, aware that each time a member of the community leaves, their home can no long serve as a bulwark and the rest of the community therefore becomes more likely to be swallowed by the desert.",
      "\u201cWe prefer to stay here. If I leave, my place will disappear,\u201d the 50-year-old date farmer said.",
      "Acacia, gum and palm trees once shielded the neighborhood from encroaching dunes, but they\u2019ve gradually disappeared. The trees have either died of thirst or have been cut down by residents needing firewood or foliage for their herds to feed on.",
      "Sandstorms are not new but have become increasingly intrusive, each leaving inches or feet in the neighborhoods on the edge of the city, retired teacher Mohamed Lemine Bahane said. Residents use mules and carts to remove the sand because the old city's streets are too narrow to accommodate cars or bulldozers. When sand piles high enough, some build new walls atop existing structures.",
      "\u201cWhen you remove the vegetation, it gives the dunes a chance to become more active, because it\u2019s ultimately the vegetation that can hold down the sand so it doesn\u2019t blow too much,\u201d Bahane said.",
      "Bahane has for years taken measurements of the sand deposits and rains and says that Chinguetti has received an annual average of 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of rainfall over the past decade. As rainfall plummets, trees die, and more sand migrates into town. And with shorter acacia trees submerged in sand, some herders resort to cutting down date palm trees to feed their flocks, further disrupting the ecosystem and date farming economy. The sands also raise public health concerns for the community breathing in the dust, Bahane said.",
      "The solution, he believes, has to be planting more trees both in neighborhoods and along the perimeter of town. Such \u201cgreen belts\u201d have been proposed on a continent-wide scale as Africa's \u201cGreat Green Wall\u201d as well as locally, in towns like Chinguetti. Mauritania's Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Agriculture as well as European-funded NGOs have floated projects to plant trees to insulate the city's libraries and manuscripts from the incoming desert.",
      "Though some have been replanted, there's little sign that it has contributed to stopping the desert in its tracks. It can take years for taproots to grow deep enough into the earth to access groundwater.",
      "\u201cWe're convinced that desertification is our destiny. But thankfully, there are still people convinced that it can be resisted,\u201d El Wely, the community leader, said.",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Security forces in Pakistan acting on intelligence raided a militant hideout in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the country's northwest on Friday, triggering an intense shootout in which six militants were killed, the military said.",
      "The raid was carried out in Karak, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, the military said in a statement. An operation was underway to eliminate any other militants found there.",
      "The military provided no further details about the killed militants, but such operations are often conducted against the Pakistani Taliban, which are also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.",
      "The TTP is an ally of the Taliban in Afghanistan and has stepped up its assaults in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "A major operation is also ongoing in Kurram, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where militants in recent months have frequently attacked Shiites and security forces escorting aid trucks for hundreds of thousands of besieged residents.",
      "Authorities say that security forces this week arrested 48 suspects accused of recent attacks on the country\u2019s troops escorting aid trucks. Some of the detainees were also involved in attacks on Shiites in the region, police said.",
      "Kurram has been cut off from the rest of the country since November after the government blocked roads following clashes between heavily armed Shiite and Sunni tribes.",
      "Authorities hope that they will soon restore order in the region, and reopen a key road leading to Kurram at the completion of the operation, which began this week, after insurgents killed five soldiers escorting aid trucks."

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis has spent one week in the hospital fighting pneumonia",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis marked the one-week point Friday in his hospital stay, getting up to eat breakfast as the 88-year-old pontiff continued fighting pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican late Thursday reported a \u201cslight improvement\u201d in his overall clinical condition, with his heart working well. But it will still take some time to understand if the various drug therapies are working, and outside doctors have said that regardless, recovery from pneumonia in such a fragile patient could take up to two weeks.",
      "According to the one-line morning bulletin Friday, \u201cThe night went well, this morning Pope Francis got up and had breakfast.\u201d",
      "Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a case of bronchitis worsened; doctors later diagnosed a complex respiratory infection, involving bacteria, virus and other organisms and the onset of pneumonia in both lungs on top of asthmatic bronchitis. They prescribed \u201cabsolute rest.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, some of Francis' cardinals began responding to the obvious question circulating: whether Francis might resign if he becomes irreversibly sick and unable to carry on. Francis has said he would consider it, after Pope Benedict XVI \u201copened the door\u201d to popes retiring.",
      "\u201cEverything is possible,\u201d said Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, the archbishop of Marseille, France.",
      "Another cardinal, Gianfranco Ravasi, was asked if Francis might decide to follow in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI and step down if he becomes too ill. Benedict became the first pope in 600 years to retire when he concluded in 2013 that he didn\u2019t have the physical strength to carry on the rigors of the globe-trotting papacy.",
      "\u201cThere is no question that if he (Francis) was in a situation where his ability to have direct contact (with people) as he likes to do ... was compromised, then I think he might decide to resign,\u201d Ravasi was quoted as telling RTL 102.5 radio.",
      "Francis confirmed in 2022 that shortly after being elected pontiff he wrote a resignation letter in case medical problems impeded him from carrying out his duties. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated.",
      "But there is no indication Francis is in anyway incapacitated or is even considering stepping aside. During his hospital stay, he has continued to work, including making bishop appointments. And besides, after Benedict died, Francis made clear that he believed the job of pope is for life.",
      "Francis had an acute case of pneumonia in 2023 and is prone to respiratory infections in winter.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in such a fragile, elderly patient makes him particularly prone to complications given the difficulty in being able to effectively expel fluid from his lungs. While his heart is strong, Francis isn\u2019t a particularly healthy 88-year-old. He is overweight, isn\u2019t physically active, uses a wheelchair because of bad knees, had part of one lung removed as a young man, and has admitted to being a not-terribly-cooperative patient in the past.",
      "Francis has had two longer hospital stays during his nearly 12-year pontificate. He spent 10 days at Gemelli in 2021 when he had 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon removed. In 2023, he was admitted for nine days for surgery to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia.",

      "SAN JOS\u00c9, Costa Rica -- A group of families and children hailing from Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more climbed down the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica's capital on Thursday, the first flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized return back to their countries.",
      "The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump \u2019s administration seeks to step up deportations.",
      "While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees of mostly Asian origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The migrants arriving to Costa Rica will be bussed hours to a rural holding facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police. The U.S. government will cover the costs.",
      "The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's visit earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of steep tariffs or sanctions.",
      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that his country is helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother from the north.\u201d",
      "Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries or sent to yet another country.",
      "Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299 deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting commercial flights back home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a situation similar to that in Panama,\u201d Badilla, the Costa Rican official, told The Associated Press.",
      "Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it described as a \u201chumanitarian bridge\u201d since there are no direct flights between the U.S. and Venezuela.",
      "A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras\u2019 foreign ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the two adversaries.",
      "Badilla said that Thursday's deportation flight from San Diego is largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily return to their countries.",
      "If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third country.",
      "\u201cCosta Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment of our country.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility, where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and other aid-focused government entities to \u201cguarantee their rights,\u201d Badilla said.",
      "The facility being used to hold migrants, a former factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past.",
      "During a visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped facilities and said they felt like \u201cprisoners.\u201d Many slept in tents on the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked. Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the government has denied journalists access to the building.",
      "The facility will also be processing a \u201creverse flow\u201d of migrants from Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now want to return home. Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed south entering the country a day.",
      "IOM said in a statement to the AP that \u201cwe do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of movement of individuals\u201d and that it was providing humanitarian support and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and \u201cidentifying safe alternatives for others.\u201d",

      "A court in Argentina has dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A court in Argentina dropped charges of criminal negligence against three of the five people indicted in connection with the death of Liam Payne, the former One Direction singer who fell from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires last October, according to a ruling obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "In its decision issued Wednesday, the Argentine federal appeals court ordered the other two defendants in the case to remain in custody. They are facing prosecution on charges they supplied the famed British boyband star with narcotics.",
      "The ruling drops charges against three key defendants: Rogelio Nores, an Argentine businessman with U.S. citizenship who had accompanied Payne during his trip in Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager of the Casa Sur Palermo Hotel where Payne died on Oct. 16; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel\u2019s main receptionist.",
      "The charge of negligent homicide carries a sentence of one to five years in prison in Argentina.",
      "A toxicology report from tests taken after an autopsy revealed that Payne, 31, had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell from the balcony.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Nores had failed to comply with his duties of care by leaving Payne alone while inebriated. The court sided with defense attorneys who contended that Nores had no legal, moral or social duty to care for Payne. He also was outside the hotel at the time of his friend's death.",
      "The two hotel employees, Martin and Grassi, were in the Casa Sur lobby on Oct. 16 when they saw Payne severely intoxicated and decided to take him to his room with the help of others, investigators determined.",
      "Prosecutors said that the men should have kept Payne away from his hotel room, where a balcony posed a clear danger, until the singer could receive proper medical care. On Wednesday, the court ruled that prosecutors failed to prove how taking Payne to his hotel room \u201cconstituted unlawful, unruly, clumsy, reckless, imprudent or negligent conduct.\"",
      "The court also ordered the other two defendants in the case \u2014 Ezequiel David Pereyra, a former employee at Casa Sur Hotel and Braian Paiz, a waiter who had served Payne at an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant \u2014 to remain in detention on charges that they supplied Payne with narcotics in the days, even hours, leading up to his death.",
      "Because the charge they face carries a sentence of four to 15 years in prison, the court said that preventative detention was justified.",
      "Payne's sudden death drew an outpouring of grief around the world from heartbroken fans of One Direction, among the best-selling boy bands of all time.",

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years ago has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II",
      "When Russian troops rolled into Ukraine three years ago, they brought their parade uniforms with them on the push to Kyiv. President Vladimir Putin expected a quick victory.",
      "What Putin dubbed the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, entire cities have been reduced to smoldering ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West.",
      "Now as senior Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping it out of NATO.",
      "President Donald Trump sharply reversed the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia when he called Putin and said afterward they agreed \u201cto work together very closely\u201d to end the war. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d in negotiations but didn't elaborate.",
      "Trump also expressed understanding of Putin\u2019s key demand on the pivotal issue of Ukraine\u2019s prospective NATO membership that the U.S. and other alliance members previously described as irreversible. \u201dThey\u2019ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cAnd I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, after demanding that NATO abandon membership for Ukraine and pull back the alliance\u2019s troops on NATO\u2019s eastern flank -- actions rejected by the West.",
      "He claimed his move was necessary to safeguard Russia\u2019s security interests and protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies denounced his move as an unprovoked act of aggression. Ukrainians saw it as Moscow's attempt to destroy their national sovereignty and identity.",
      "Russian troops reached the outskirts of Kyiv early in the invasion but pulled back a month later amid heavy losses and Ukraine's attacks on supply lines. More humiliating setbacks came in September and October 2022, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russia to pull back from large parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Kherson region in the south.",
      "Fortunes changed in 2023 when a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south failed to cut Russia's land route to the Crimea Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.",
      "Russia seized the combat initiative last year with offensives along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front, making slow but persistent gains. In the fall, Russian forces captured the most territory since the opening of the war.",
      "Moscow also pummeled Ukrainian infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power generating capacity.",
      "Ukraine struck back in August with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region to try to distract Moscow's forces in the east and gain more leverage in potential peace talks. Ukraine still holds some of those gains, but its limited resources are stretched, making it difficult to defend strongholds in the east.",
      "While Zelenskyy earlier demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied areas as a precondition for talks, he later acknowledged Kyiv can\u2019t immediately reclaim all its territory. He said Ukraine won't abandon its goal of joining NATO \u2014 even though Trump dismissed that as \u201cimpractical\u201d \u2014 and Zelenskyy emphasized needing reliable Western security guarantees and a robust European peacekeeping force to prevent Russian attacks.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin and ensuing Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia shattered the Biden administration's \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d policy. Trump blamed Kyiv for failing to make a deal with Moscow that could have prevented the war, praised Russia's military might and even suggested that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine won\u2019t accept any deal negotiated without Kyiv and insisted that European allies must participate in peace talks. He dismissed a U.S.-proposed draft agreement that would give Washington a large share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as too focused on U.S. interests and had no security guarantees for Kyiv.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach stunned European allies, whose shock deepened when Vice President JD Vance sharply rebuked them at the Munich security conference over free speech and migration.",
      "While the Trump administration said European allies weren't welcome at the peace talks, it encouraged them to provide security guarantees for Kyiv in what former British ambassador Nigel Gould-Davies called a contradictory approach.",
      "Washington \"has signaled that the U.S. alone will negotiate an end to the war but also that Europe alone must pay for and enforce an outcome it has not played a role in deciding,\u201d said Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Putin's key goals remain much the same \u2014 that Ukraine renounce joining NATO and enforce the use of the Russian language to keep the country in Moscow's orbit \u2014 but now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.",
      "He said a peace agreement could be broadly based on a draft negotiated early in the war that obliged Ukraine to declare neutrality, scale down its military and protect Russian language and culture. Those talks collapsed in April 2022 with no deal.",
      "Putin ruled out a truce, arguing it would benefit Kyiv. But some Kremlin-watchers believe he could accept it if Kyiv agrees to hold elections after a ceasefire.",
      "Trump echoed Putin's line that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, needs to face voters, while Kyiv maintains elections are impossible to hold amid a war. Trump escalated that notion Wednesday by posting on social media that Zelenskyy was \u201ca Dictator without Elections.\u201d",
      "Putin could hope an election would weaken Zelenskyy and lead to political instability, said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "\u201cIn his view, most potential outcomes would be advantageous for Moscow \u2014 whether through heightened political infighting, possible protests, or a fragile victory for a new president,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Jack Watling of London's Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine faces \u201ca politically divisive election, economic paralysis due to a lack of foreign direct investment, and coercive threats from Russia to restart the war\u201d after a truce.",
      "It's unclear who would monitor any potential ceasefire.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO should play no role and that any European troops taking part should not be covered by NATO\u2019s charter obliging allies to aid of any member under attack -\u2013 conditions that could dampen European enthusiasm about the mission.",
      "While the U.K. and others signal readiness to deploy troops for such a mission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia that Moscow won't accept troops from any NATO members in a peacekeeping force.",
      "Some reports suggested Chinese or Brazilian troops as part of a monitoring force, but those countries haven\u2019t signaled any intention of participation.",
      "Many believe Putin is no rush to make a peace deal.",
      "\u201cNegotiations appear desirable but by no means necessary for Russia to achieve its goals in its war against Ukraine,\u201d Stanovaya wrote.",
      "\u201cVirtually any outcome will be a good result for Moscow,\u201d she said, pointing at the erosion of Western unity and reduced Western support for Kyiv amid Moscow\u2019s gains.",
      "\u201cPutin has repeatedly made it clear that he believes Russia can achieve its goals in Ukraine without any U.S.-brokered deal,\u201d Stanovaya noted. \u201cAs far as he is concerned, Moscow simply needs to wait until Ukraine falls apart of its own accord, after which the Russian army will crush any remaining resistance among the Ukrainian army.\u201d",

    "summary": "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a &ldquo;new inclusive government&rdquo; in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
    "story": [
      "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a \u201cnew inclusive government\u201d in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions\u201d imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus.",
      "After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its \u201csalvation government\u201d that had ruled in northwestern Syria.",
      "The country\u2019s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions.",
      "In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced.",
      "Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight.",
      "\u201cI think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,\u201d Pedersen said.",
      "The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad\u2019s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities.",
      "Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the impasse.",
      "Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country\u2019s new rulers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel\u2019s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement.",
      "Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel\u2019s security and that their presence would be temporary.",
      "Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and \u201cthere is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,\u201d he said."

      "But Belgium-based International Crisis Group warned in a new report that it could be dangerous to hold elections prematurely given a surge in gang violence.",

      "Council President Leslie Voltaire recently said that he believes Haiti can hold elections on Nov. 15 and runoffs early next year, but in only eight of 10 regions in Haiti that are free of gangs.",
      "International Crisis Group noted that the pace of elections depends on funds allocated by the Haitian government and foreign donors, with only $45 million available so far out of an estimated $90 million to $120 million needed.",
      "The group also warned that multiple challenges to holding elections persist.",
      "\u201cPartisan infighting and corruption allegations have prolonged political dysfunction,\u201d it said. \u201cViolence rages, with gangs perpetrating some of the worst massacres ever as the understaffed, underfunded foreign mission struggles to rein them in.\u201d",

      "\u201cTheir situation continues to be of major concern to us,\u201d said Mia Amor Mottley, Barbados\u2019 prime minister and Caricom chairperson. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to be sufficient just to be able to say that Haiti will have an election on Nov. 15. It is not going to be sufficient to just stabilize the security situation of Haiti.\u201d"

      "Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving on Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory's narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng's crackdown on dissent.",
      "The Democratic Party's central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party's members.",
      "Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens.",
      "\u201cWhen we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China's central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019.",
      "Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city\u2019s \u201cFather of Democracy,\u201d Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau.",
      "Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild.",
      "But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city's political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law \u2014 which authorities insist is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city\u2019s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced.",
      "Last year, some of the party\u2019s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city\u2019s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it.",
      "In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city\u2019s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that \u201cpatriots\u201d administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils.",
      "Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said.",
      "When the former British colony was returned to China's rule in 1997, the governing principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories.",
      "But Lo said his party's interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Beijing government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices.",
      "\u201cThe path to democracy is always difficult,\u201d Lo said. \u201cI have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.\u201d"

Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.",

Now, these companies are also eyeing the region\u2019s offshore wind farm prospects.",
      "\u201cThis cemetery is sacred to us, the Wayuu,\u201d 64-year-old Velasquez said in Spanish, though she is more comfortable speaking in her native Wayuunaiki. Wayuu leaders say what is threatened isn\u2019t the cemetery itself but the spirituality of the territory. \u201cIt is here that the bones of our ancestors rest. That's what matters most to us.\u201d",
      "The region could generate approximately 15 gigawatts of wind energy, according to Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which could power up to an estimated 37.5 million homes annually. It's part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The Wayuu say this isn\u2019t happening.",
      "Construction started on the La Guajira 1 wind farm \u2014 which looms over the cemetery near Cabo de la Vela \u2014 in 2020 after a mix of legal processes, government backing, and controversial negotiations and unsatisfactory prior consultation. It faced significant opposition from the Wayuu and has been producing electricity since 2022, but is not yet hooked up to the interconnected system.",
      "\u201cWayuu spirituality is the fundamental base of our life and existence,\u201d said An\u00edbal Mercado, a \u201cPalabrero,\u201d head of the regional Wayuu council. He wasn't part of the consultations due to his staunch opposition. \u201cIf something disturbs the peacefulness of our dead, they\u2019re affecting spiritual peace and tranquility. And as long as (the turbines) are there, there is going to be direct violation, anxiety and impact.\u201d",

      "A lot of the population also preserve traditional, semi nomadic ways of living on \u201crancherias,\u201d which are thatched-like roofed huts, made from dried cacti and mud, herd cattle and goats, and many are armed. They also have a traditional governance system and laws based on their cultural and spiritual practices.",
      "Critics warn that the government\u2019s push to expedite approvals for other developments could escalate tensions.",
      "\u201cLa Guajira has been very sought after by these companies,\u201d Samuel Lanao, head of Corpoguajira, La Guajira\u2019s environment authority told The Associated Press in Riohacha, the region's capital. \u201cWhen a foreign company enters these territories with the intention of exploiting renewable energies, there is always going to be a clash.\"",
      "Colombia's government has committed to respecting Indigenous rights through legal frameworks like the 1991 Constitution, which recognizes Indigenous autonomy, and international agreements that ensure their right to prior consultation and participation in decisions that affect them. The 2016 Peace Agreement also touched on Indigenous communities\u2019 rights, land restitution, and participation in political processes.",
      "Social issues have begun to spook companies, with 57 planned projects stalled, according to Indepaz, a Bogot\u00e1-based development organization with extensive research on the matter. While some projects are Colombian, the majority involve international companies from Brazil, Europe, U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re worried. There\u2019s been a slowdown in the progress of these energy transition projects precisely because of that conflict,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cI believe that the national government plays an important role in achieving a community-company agreement.\u201d",
      "Colombia\u2019s environment ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its lifespan, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine what this energy transition means to us,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cThis renewable energy sector comes to supply the income that the coal exploitation gives us today in La Guajira.\u201d",
      "Developing wind projects in Guajira is key to guaranteeing a reliable supply of electricity in Colombia, says Margarita Nieves, founder of Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network and La Guajira native.",
      "Nieves added for La Guajira, it represents an opportunity to have a new industry that will generate employment, position it as a center for the production of goods and services for the wind energy sector, and contribute to meeting the electricity demand of its inhabitants.",
      "But the issue is also causing internal friction within the Wayuu community which stems from differing views on economic benefits, with some supporting development for financial gain.",
      "The AP spoke to several Wayuu families living near wind turbines who do not oppose the companies operating there, as they have received financial assistance and housing.",
      "Others are not convinced.",
      "\u201cAn old saying goes that if you\u2019ve never owned a chicken, manure looks like an egg to you,\u201d Mercado, the Palabrero, said when asked about those in the community who accept help from the companies, which is much less than what he'd consider fair compensation.",
      "\u201cThere are many communities that have never had anything. In the midst of so much need, so much crisis, so much hunger, any little penny that they are being offered now seems like a miracle cure and the greatest wealth in the world to them,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies are now carrying out studies for offshore wind farms, which is also enraging the Wayuu, especially traditional fishers, known as Apalanchii.",
      "Lanao, of the environmental authority, says just because the project is in the sea, it does not mean the communities do not have influence.",
      "The Apalanchii use traditional fishing techniques, with nets, hooks and sometimes spearfishing. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a culturally important activity which they say ties them to their ancestors and the land.",
      "\u201cWe are really worried about the offshore wind farms,\u201d said fisherman Aaron Laguna Ipuana, 57, during an early morning fishing trip in Cabo de la Vela with his crew. \u201cThey're going to displace us and the sea is everything to us. It sustains us.\"",
      "Mercado says the government needs to do more to ensure Wayuu people are involved.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that these projects continue and that the government is letting them go ahead, without even coming to say what is going to happen and what is in the interest of the Wayuu people,\" said Mercado.",
      "\u201cThe Wayuu defend their territory with blood and death, if necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "At the cemetery, Velasquez, dressed in a traditional Wayuu robe and headscarf, gently strokes and observes the graves alongside her sister and young niece. In the background, the turbine blades continue to turn.",
      "\u201cThe nobility of a Wayuu is used by companies,\u201d Velazquez says. \u201cMay they do something good for us ... the way we want it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
    "story": [
      "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but 2025 appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Still, shares tumbled nearly 9% before the opening bell Thursday and it pulled other big retailers down with it. The retail sector is the biggest decliner in premarket trading and Target slid 2%.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation. Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "For Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",

More than 800,000 new arrivals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ukraine and Afghanistan were also welcomed with help from financial supporters through a legal tool known as humanitarian parole.",
      "That screeched to a halt after President Donald Trump's inauguration and his administration\u2019s immediate 90-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program \u2014 a move that stranded thousands of vetted refugees, cut nonprofits' staffing and left sponsors uneasy about the future of fledgling programs they felt had enriched their own lives.",
      "Rivly Breus is among those feeling anxious. Working from a pastel peach house in South Florida, the crisis counselor has backed the resettlement of more than 30 people from Haiti, Ukraine and Cuba.

      "The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower than its previous estimate. The group\u2019s economists assessed that Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs won\u2019t likely have a major impact on South Korea\u2019s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy more.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is considering buying used Boeing aircraft \u2014 perhaps from an overseas seller \u2014 to use as Air Force One when he's aboard, as he fumes over the U.S. plane-maker's delays in producing two specially modified ones for presidential use.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard one of the two nearly 35-year-old Boeing 747-200 aircraft in current use, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at alternatives, because it\u2019s taking Boeing too long.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe may go and buy a plane,\u201d Trump said, adding that he could then \u201cconvert it.\u201d He later clarified that he was ruling out purchasing aircraft of Airbus, the European company that is the only other global supplier on large wide-body aircraft, but would consider a second-hand Boeing plane. \u201cI would not consider Airbus. I could buy one from another country perhaps or get one from another country.\"",
      "Boeing has the contract to produce updated versions, based on the more modern Boeing 747-8, but delivery has been delayed while the aircraft maker has lost billions of dollars on the deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office.",
      "It's not the planes, rather the heavy modification to make them suitable for the requirements of presidential travel and the top-level security clearances required for those involved, that has added to the cost and delays. Trump already dropped a requirement for the new generation of planes, which will be known as the VC-25B, to be capable of air-to-air refueling, like the pair of existing VC-25As, which were designed during the Cold War.",
      "Other modifications include highly classified communications equipment suitable for the country's commander-in-chief, survivability enhancements for a range of contingencies, and self-contained air-stairs, allowing for their use in austere landing environments.",
      "Delivery initially was set for 2024, but has been pushed to some time in 2027 for the first plane and in 2028 \u2014 Trump\u2019s final year in office \u2014 for the second, according to the U.S. Air Force.",
      "Trump on Saturday toured a newer Boeing 747-800 airplane to check out new hardware and technology features and highlight the aircraft maker\u2019s delay in delivering updated versions of the Air Force One presidential aircraft, the White House said Saturday. Trump visited the 13-year-old private aircraft that had been owned by the Qatari royal family while it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport.",

      "LONDON -- Apple said Friday it will stop offering an advanced data security option for British users after the government reportedly demanded that the company provide backdoor access for any data those users have stored in the cloud.",
      "The iPhone maker said its Advanced Data Protection encryption feature is no longer available for new users in the United Kingdom and will eventually be disabled for existing users.",
      "Advanced Data Protection, which Apple started rolling out at the end of 2022, is an opt-in feature that protects iCloud files, photos, notes and other data with end-to-end encryption when they're stored in the cloud.",
      "British security officials demanded in a secret order that the U.S. tech giant create so-called backdoor access so that they could view fully encrypted material, The Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing anonymous sources.",
      "Apple \u201ccan no longer offer Advanced Data Protection\u201d in the U.K., the company said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,\u201d Apple said, without referring to the government demand.",
      "The Washington Post report said the British government served Apple with what's known as a \u201ctechnical capability notice\" ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers' charter.",
      "The law officially gives British spies the ability to hack into devices and harvest vast amounts of bulk online data, much of it from outside the U.K. It contains provisions to compel companies to remove encryption to allow for electronic eavesdropping, while making it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has issued such demands.",

      "The episode illustrates \u201cone of the fundamental flaws in government efforts to undermine encryption,\" said Mike Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. Faced with having to choose between security and complying with government regulations, companies like Apple tend to remove security features entirely, said Chapple, a former computer scientist at the National Security Agency.",
      "\u201cThe net effect is reduced security for everyone. If other governments follow the UK\u2019s lead, we risk a future where strong encryption is functionally outlawed, which puts all of us at risk not just to government surveillance but also to eavesdropping by other bad actors.\u201d"

      "An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers",
      "WASHINGTON -- An idea first proposed on social media has bubbled up to the White House and received President Donald Trump's enthusiastic endorsement: Take some of the savings from billionaire Elon Musk's drive to cut government spending and return it to taxpayers.",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said late Wednesday on Air Force One, when asked about the proposal.",
      "If Musk's target of $2 trillion in spending cuts is achieved by next year, supporters of the idea say that about one-fifth of those funds could be distributed to taxpaying households in checks of about $5,000.",
      "But before you start planning for a windfall, budget experts say such huge savings \u2014 nearly one-third of the federal government's annual spending \u2014 are highly unlikely. And sending out a round of checks \u2014 similar to the stimulus payments distributed by Trump and then President Joe Biden during the pandemic \u2014 could fuel inflation, economists warn, though White House officials dismiss that concern.",
      "With the annual budget deficit at $1.8 trillion last year and Trump proposing extensive tax cuts, there will also be significant pressure to use all the savings to reduce that deficit, rather than pass on part of it.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposal:",
      "James Fishback, founder of investment firm Azoria Partners which he launched at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, promoted the idea Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter, prompting Musk to respond that he would \u201ccheck with the president.\u201d Fishback said there have also been \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d conversations about the issue with White House officials.",
      "Musk has estimated that his Department of Government Efficiency has cut $55 billion so far \u2014 a tiny fraction of the $6.8 trillion federal budget. But DOGE\u2019s public statements so far haven't verified the presumed savings, and its claims that tens of millions of dead people are fraudulently receiving Social Security have been disproven.",
      "Fishback supports having the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determine how much DOGE saved. If DOGE cuts $500 billion by July 2026, he said, then the checks would be $1,250, rather than $5,000.",
      "\u201cWe uncovered enormous waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Fishback said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we are going to make good and pay restitution and then rewrite the social contract between the taxpayer and the federal government.\u201d",
      "Fishback supports sending out checks, rather than using all the money to reduce the deficit, because it would encourage Americans to seek out wasteful government spending \u201cin their communities, and report it to DOGE.\u201d",
      "OK, let\u2019s slow down. According to the proposal, DOGE must first complete its work, slated to be done by July 2026. Once that happens, one-fifth of any savings could be distributed later that year to the roughly 79 million households that pay income taxes. About 40% of Americans don\u2019t pay such taxes, so they wouldn\u2019t get a check.",
      "Color most economists and budget experts skeptical that its focus on \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d can actually reduce government spending by much. Budget-cutters from both parties have sought to eliminate \u201cwaste\u201d \u2014 which doesn't have much of a political constituency \u2014 for decades, with little success in reducing the deficit.",
      "One of the biggest moves by the Trump administration so far has been to fire tens of thousands of government workers, but such changes aren't likely to produce big savings.",
      "\u201cOnly a small share of total spending goes to federal employees,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe big money is in federal benefits and in federal taxes and those are not in DOGE\u2019s purview.\u201d",
      "In November, John DiIulio Jr., a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an essay for the Brookings Institution that \"eliminating the entire federal civilian workforce would leave in place about 95% of all federal spending and the $34 trillion national debt.\u2019\u2019 DiIulio noted that government contractors and nonprofits that receive government funds now employ three times as many people as the federal government's 2.2 million employees.",
      "Trump and his economists blame Biden's $1,200 stimulus checks, distributed in the spring of 2021, for fueling the worst spike in inflation in four decades. Yet they maintain that sending checks stemming from reduced government spending wouldn't boost inflation.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Thursday that since the money would have been spent by the government anyway, having it spent by consumers would be a wash. Biden and Trump's stimulus checks during the pandemic were deficit-financed, which can be more inflationary.",
      "But Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, and an economist in the Biden White House, said that more government checks are \u201cthe last thing we need economically right now.\u201d",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate is now much lower than in 2021, Tedeschi said, which means that businesses could struggle to hire enough workers to meet the additional demand created by a round of checks. Worker shortages can push up prices.",
      "Yet some Democrats agree with Hassett, but for different reasons.",
      "\"I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be inflationary because I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d be big enough,\u2019\u2019 said Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.",
      "Kamarck, who worked with Vice President Al Gore to cut government waste in the Clinton administration, dismissed the DOGE dividend as \u201cridiculous.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no money there, and certainly not enough money to make a big contribution to taxpayers,\" she said. \u201cThe guy just says things,\" she added, referring to Musk."

      "Argentine President Javier Milei is facing a corruption probe into his promotion of a meme coin, which is a highly speculative form of cryptocurrency that\u2019s seen a recent surge in popularity after President Donald Trump and his wife launched tokens of ...",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentine President Javier Milei is facing a corruption probe into his promotion of a meme coin, which is a highly speculative form of cryptocurrency that\u2019s surged in popularity after President Donald Trump and his wife launched tokens of their own.",
      "The budding scandal in Argentina has been dubbed locally as \u201ccryptogate\u201d and has links to a diverse cast of characters, including a high-profile U.S. influencer, a crypto developer who uses the pseudonym \u201cMeow,\u201d and a 28-year-old American entrepreneur who said he helped launch first lady Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin last month.",
      "Here\u2019s an explainer on what happened and where things stand:",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that are generally just goofs on internet memes, viral moments or celebrities that aren\u2019t trying to make use of a new technology or solve any new problems. They often have silly names, like Dogecoin, or Fartcoin.",
      "Critics \u2013 including many cryptocurrency enthusiasts \u2014 say they are nothing more than digital Ponzi schemes that exist to enrich insiders at the expense of retail investors. Those more supportive say meme coins shouldn\u2019t be so easily dismissed and could be early indicators of ways in which the internet could revolutionize financial and other transactions.",
      "\u201cNew technologies often look like a toy but evolve into something much more powerful over time,\u201d Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a recent social media post.",
      "In short, a disaster.",
      "Milei, the tech-loving, chainsaw-wielding, libertarian president of Argentina, posted on X about the meme coin $LIBRA on Friday, just after it had launched, stating he was \u201cencouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.\u201d",
      "The coin\u2019s price soared almost immediately, pushing the market value for the project beyond $4 billion.",
      "A few hours after launch, early holders of the coin started cashing out of the project and its price collapsed.",
      "The trajectory of $LIBRA\u2019s price had the hallmarks of a \u201crug pull,\u201d a not uncommon phenomenon with meme coins. Rug pulls occur when insiders dump their holdings in newly launched meme coins that are soaring in value, which tanks the price and causes losses to newer investors.",
      "Milei deleted his initial post after the price collapsed and distanced himself from the project. By Monday, dozens of criminal complaints had been filed, a judge in Argentina had been selected to investigate allegations of fraud and Argentina\u2019s main opposition party called for his impeachment.",
      "On Friday, a federal prosecutor formally opened the probe to determine the involvement of Milei and five others in the creation and promotion of $LIBRA, for the possible crimes of bribery, fraud, influence peddling and abuse of authority.",
      "A defiant Milei insisted he had acted in good faith and said that he had asked the Justice Ministry\u2019s Anti-Corruption Office to investigate if he or anyone else had committed wrongdoing.",
      "Hayden Davis, a 28-year-old American crypto developer who said he\u2019s an adviser to Milei and helped launch $LIBRA, has emerged as a central figure. Milei\u2019s office said the government has no connection to Davis.",
      "In an interview with independent crypto journalist Stephen Findeisen, Davis said that meme coins are essentially a rigged game that benefit a small group of people at the expense of retail investors.",
      "\u201cIt is an insiders\u2019 game. This is an unregulated casino,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Davis said the $LIBRA coin was not a rug pull but was supposed to be an experiment to show the power and utility of digital currency that\u2019s consistent with Milei\u2019s desire for Argentina to be a hub for innovation.",
      "Davis also said he was involved in the launch of Melania Trump\u2019s meme coin. Launched just before her husband took office, that meme coin\u2019s price underwent a similar trajectory as $LIBRA \u2014 quickly soaring upon launch and then dropping. The first lady\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Online influencer Dave Portnoy, who founded the Barstool Sports podcast empire and is a vocal gambling enthusiast, said on social media that Davis had told him about $LIBRA\u2019s launch before it went public and asked him to promote it.",
      "Portnoy said there were also discussions about the possibility of him interviewing Milei, much like he\u2019d done with President Donald Trump during his first term. Portnoy said he did not buy any $LIBRA until after Milei\u2019s post on X and lost money on the purchase when the price crashed. Davis said he reimbursed Portnoy\u2019s losses.",
      "\u201cMeow\u201d is the anonymous co-founder of a crypto firm involved in launching meme coins, including $LIBRA, said on social media that they were confident that no one at the firms had been involved in insider trading or financial wrongdoing. Still, Meow said the company had hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation and that one of the company\u2019s leaders had resigned for showing \u201ca lack of judgement.\u201d",
      "Cryptogate represents the first big scandal of Milei\u2019s presidency. Analysts said it risks eroding public confidence in Milei, who rose to prominence as an iconoclastic economist vowing to tame Argentina\u2019s sky-high inflation and eliminate corruption among the political elite.",
      "Questions remain over how this will affect the Milei administration\u2019s perception among foreign investors at a crucial time in which the government is hoping to ease strict currency controls and negotiate a loan with the International Monetary Fund. He is now in Washington meeting with Tesla chief Elon Musk and other high-profile tech leaders in a bid to generate hype for his economic overhaul.",
      "Meme coins don\u2019t appear to be going away anytime soon, but their track record should serve as a cautionary tale for investors and creators alike.",
      "The meme coins promoted by Trump and his wife have seen their prices fall dramatically since the days after their launch and drawn criticism from some Democrats and crypto enthusiasts.",
      "Hailey Welch, better known as Hawk Tuah Girl, saw her popularity plummet after her meme coin collapsed amid allegations of a rug pull. And celebrity Caitlyn Jenner is the defendant in an ongoing class action lawsuit filed by investors who said they were duped into losing money on the $JENNER meme coin. Welch and Jenner have both denied wrongdoing.",
      "The impoverished Central African Republic issued a meme coin earlier this month. After a brief spike, its price has also collapsed.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he saw no appetite for peace from Russia in Ukraine after listening to a speech by Russia's top diplomat at a tense Group of 20 meeting in South Africa on Thursday.",
      "Lammy was speaking to reporters after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed other senior diplomats in a closed-door session at the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg.",
      "\"I have to say when I listened to what the Russians and what Lavrov have just said in the chamber this afternoon, I don\u2019t see an appetite to really get to that peace,\u201d Lammy said.",
      "Lammy said Lavrov left his seat in the meeting room when it was Lammy's turn to speak. No details of Lavrov's speech were released.",
      "The two-day G20 gathering on Thursday and Friday comes days after landmark bilateral talks between the United States and Russia over ending the war in Ukraine. Those talks sidelined Washington\u2019s European allies and Ukraine, who weren\u2019t involved.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has further upended the West\u2019s position by criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and falsely blaming Ukraine for the full-scale invasion by Russia. The war\u2019s third anniversary is next week.",
      "\u201cAt the moment, we\u2019ve had talks effectively about talks,\" Lammy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not got anywhere near a negotiated settlement.\"",
      "In his own speech, which was released by the U.K. Foreign Office, Lammy criticized Russia for what he called \u201cTsarist imperialism.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, mature countries learn from their colonial failures and their wars, and Europeans have had much to learn over the generations and the centuries,\u201d Lammy said, according to the transcript from the U.K. Foreign Office. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid to say that Russia has learned nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was hoping to hear some sympathy for the innocent victims of the aggression. I was hoping to hear some readiness to seek a durable peace. What I heard was the logic of imperialism dressed up as a realpolitik, and I say to you all, we should not be surprised, but neither should we be fooled.\u201d",
      "Lammy referred to Lavrov's speech as \u201cthe Russian gentleman\u2019s tired fabrications.\u201d",
      "Tensions at the meeting were underlined when a photo opportunity for the foreign ministers to pose together for pictures was canceled with no reason given.",
      "The United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union have all pledged continued support for Ukraine and were expected to reinforce that position at the G20 meeting.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led those talks with Lavrov in Saudi Arabia this week, was a high-profile absentee from the meeting. Rubio boycotted amid U.S. tensions with host South Africa over some of its policies, which the Trump administration has labeled anti-American. The U.S. was represented by Dana Brown, its acting ambassador to South Africa.",
      "The G20 is made up of 19 of the world's major economies, the European Union and the African Union. Others attending the meeting in South Africa included EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, who repeated France's condemnation of Russia in an op-ed published by several media outlets.",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry did release details of a bilateral meeting Lavrov held with China's Wang. Afterwards, Lavrov said Russia's relations with China \"have become and remain an increasingly significant factor in stabilizing the international situation and preventing it from sliding into total confrontation,\u201d according to a statement from the ministry.",
      "The G20 is supposed to bring developed and developing countries together to foster global cooperation. But the grouping often struggles to reach any meaningful consensus because of the disparate interests of the U.S., Europe, Russia and China. Cooperation was further undermined by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "South Africa holds the G20's rotating presidency this year and in a speech opening the meeting, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that it was an opportunity for the G20 \u201cto engage in serious dialogue\u201d against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions and war, climate change, pandemics and energy and food insecurity.",
      "\"There is a lack of consensus among major powers, including in the G20, on how to respond to these issues,\u201d Ramaphosa said.",
      "Rubio's decision to boycott and his pledge to also skip the main G20 summit in South Africa in November threatens to further undermine the G20's effectiveness.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said that he won't attend a G20 finance ministers meeting in South Africa next week because of commitments in Washington, which many saw as another indication of Trump's indifference to international collaboration in favor of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",

      "VALLARTA, Mexico -- Aldrich Potgieter had the lead going into the final round of the Mexico Open, minus the cushion he enjoyed after a sloppy finish Saturday that made him settle for a 4-under 67 and a one-shot advantage over Brian Campbell at Vidanta Vallarta.",
      "Potgieter, the 20-year-old power player from South Africa, started with a four-shot lead and held off one challenge early from Stephan Jaeger, who closed within one shot after six holes.",
      "The next challenge came from Campbell, who at times was 50 yards shorter off the tee than Potgieter but made up for it with his putter, including a 60-foot birdie on the par-3 ninth.",
      "Potgieter was leading by three shots with two holes left in the third round when he badly missed his tee shot to the right on the par-3 17th, the ball settling in some bushes. He managed to punch that out into the grass, then hit a beautiful pitch to save bogey.",
      "On the par-5 18th, Potgieter came up well short with a 7-iron for his second shot after another big drive. From a waste area, he went just over the back of the green, chipped to a front pin and had to make a 5-footer for par.",
      "Campbell finished with a birdie for a 64 to get within one shot as both go for their first PGA Tour title and a trip to the Masters.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s playing a different course than we are,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt\u2019s been honestly fun to watch. I know him from last year (on the Korn Ferry Tour), so it\u2019s just been fun. I\u2019m playing my game, he\u2019s playing his game and we\u2019ll see where that stacks up.\u201d",

      "Potgieter was at 20-under 193.",
      "\u201cBesides the last two holes, it was really good,\u201d Potgieter said. \u201cBrian was having a great round so I tried to just stay a little bit ahead of him. All three of us played pretty decent golf. It got a little tough throughout the day with the wind a little bit, some pin placements were a little bit more tough so didn\u2019t make as many putts today, but we\u2019ll save it for tomorrow.\u201d",
      "He would love nothing more than a return to Augusta National, where he played in 2023 as the British Amateur champion. Potgieter earned his PGA Tour card through the Korn Ferry Tour, which featured one win early and a 59 in Colombia.",
      "That firepower \u2014 particularly is length \u2014 is what has kept him in front at Vidanta Vallarta, a course with five par 5s and plenty of room off the tee. He has led the field in driving distance all three days, checking in 329.4 yards for his average Saturday.",
      "He played in the last group with Campbell and Jaeger \u2014 the same trio for the final round \u2014 and Campbell wasn't the least bit bothered by the difference in length. He plotted his way to a bogey-free round that gives him a shot at his first PGA Tour win.",
      "Jaeger, who held off Scottie Scheffler to win the Houston Open last year, drove into the water on the reachable par-4 seventh hole after getting within one shot of Potgieter. He made bogey, a two-shot swing when the South African made birdie, and Jaeger did well to finish within three shots at the end of the round.",
      "\u201cObviously, the bogey on 7 kind of hurt. That\u2019s kind of one that hit a good drive, it\u2019s pretty much automatic birdie so kind of a two shot swing there,\u201d Jaeger said. \u201cOther than that, I gave myself some nice looks, hit a bunch of lips, but I\u2019m in a great spot tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Alex Smalley had a 64 and was five shots behind, with Aaron Rai (68) and Ben Griffin (67) another shot back.",
      "Justin Hastings of the Cayman Islands, the San Diego State senior who won the Latin American Amateur last month to earn a trip to the Masters, had a 65 and was tied for ninth with Patrick Rodgers and Nicolai Hojgaard, who twice chipped in for eagle on the back nine.",
      "\u201cNow that I made the cut, which I think was a big goal this week, it took a lot of stress off and I felt like I played a lot more free today,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cYeah, I think it showed on the scorecard. It was a lot less stressful.\u201d",
      "The stakes Sunday are more than just a trip to the Masters. The winner will gets in The Players Championship and the PGA Championship, along with five of the remaining $20 million signature events. Jaeger is already in from his top-50 finish in the FedEx Cup last year.",

      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins honored Hall of Fame broadcaster Mike Lange during an emotional ceremony before Saturday's game against Washington.",
      "Lange, who died on Wednesday at 76, called Penguin games for 46 years and spent five decades in broadcasting before retiring in 2021.",
      "The Penguins invited Lange's two sons, their families, and some of Lange's former broadcasting partners onto the ice before the opening faceoff. Longtime Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby along with Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang greeted them and then stood alongside them during a lengthy video package that featured some of Lange's iconic sayings, from \u201cIt's a hockey night in Pittsburgh\u201d to \u201che beat him like a rented mule.\"",
      "Fans finished the ceremony by giving Lange a long, loud standing ovation while one of his sons flashed a sign that read \u201cThank you Pittsburgh.\u201d",
      "The team placed a large picture of Lange next to a table filled with a vase of yellow roses and a set of headphones along the lower concourse at PPG Paints Arena. There was another gathering of flowers and another set of headphones inside one of the radio booths on the press level, which was named after Lange in 2019.",
      "The Penguins sported stickers on the back of their black helmets with a microphone and headphones set against a gold background.",
      "Lange spent nearly five decades chronicling the franchise\u2019s rise from also-ran to Stanley Cup champion five times over, his unique delivery and quirky sayings serving as the soundtrack for iconic moments from Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux and longtime running mate Jaromir Jagr to current stars Crosby and Malkin.",
      "The Hockey Hall of Fame inducted Lange in 2001 when he received the Foster Hewitt Award for broadcast excellence.",

      "Soto also homered last year in his first spring training game with the New York Yankees, belting a three-run shot in the fourth inning of that matchup with Toronto.",
      "Soto signed a record $765 million, 15-year contract this offseason, moving across New York from the Yankees to the Mets. He hit second in the order Saturday, between Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso, and drilled a 426-foot homer on a 2-1 pitch from left-hander Colton Gordon. The following inning, Soto drove in another run with a groundball. Those were his only plate appearances.",
      "He raised his career spring training average to .304 with 14 home runs and an OPS of 1.017 in 87 games.",
      "The Mets may have been even more encouraged by the performance of starter Clay Holmes, another player who moved from one New York team to the other. Holmes has started just four of his 311 big league appearances, but he is converting to a starter for the Mets and threw 34 pitches Saturday in three perfect innings.",
      "Holmes struck out three.",

      "Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding posted its fastest revenue growth in over a year, beating analyst expectations as it capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom in China",
      "HONG KONG -- Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding posted its fastest revenue growth in more than a year, beating analyst expectations as it capitalizes on the artificial intelligence boom in China.",
      "Alibaba said Thursday that its revenue for the quarter ended December grew 8% to 280.2 billion yuan ($38.38 billion) compared to the same period last year.",
      "Net income surged to 48.9 billion yuan ($6.71 billion). Alibaba\u2019s New York-traded stock was up over 12% following the earnings results.",
      "In an earnings call, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said that Alibaba plans to \u201caggressively invest\u201d in artificial intelligence and cloud computing infrastructure in the coming three years, with upcoming spending expected to exceed what the firm has already invested over the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results demonstrated substantial progress in our \u2018user first, AI-driven\u2019 strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses,\u201d Wu said.",
      "He said that Alibaba\u2019s artificial intelligence strategy was to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is artificial intelligence that can match or surpass human intelligence and can self-teach.",
      "He added that such an opportunity for industry transformation is something that comes along \u201conce every several decades\u201d and said that AGI was Alibaba\u2019s primary goal.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s plan to go big on artificial intelligence comes as rivalry in the AI space heats up between U.S. and China. Chinese AI firm DeepSeek recently rattled the U.S. AI industry after its AI model appeared to rival those of leading U.S. companies while being trained on cheaper hardware.",
      "The Hangzhou-headquartered firm is one of many technology firms in China who are racing to get ahead in the AI space. In January, it unveiled its latest Qwen AI models that have performed well in benchmark tests, placing Alibaba among the leading companies in China\u2019s AI industry.",
      "Alibaba is working with Apple to incorporate its AI technology into Chinese iPhones, the firm said earlier this month.",
      "Alibaba has already implemented AI technology into its cloud products, with its cloud business unit generating 13% revenue growth compared to the same time last year \u2013 the fastest pace in about two years.",
      "Its international commerce unit, which includes platforms such as AliExpress and Lazada, saw revenue growth of 32% driven by \u201cstrong performance of cross-border businesses.\u201d",
      "Alibaba was one of several prominent Chinese technology companies which suffered the brunt of a regulatory crackdown on the technology industry in 2020, when authorities scuppered the initial public offering of its financial affiliate Ant Group.",
      "The company was later fined a record $2.8 billion for violating anti-monopoly laws. Jack Ma, one of Alibaba\u2019s cofounders, disappeared from public view and the company\u2019s stock price slumped for several years.",
      "But Beijing appears to have shifted gears towards the technology industry as it pursues technology supremacy and self-sufficiency amid deteriorating U.S.-China relations.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held a private symposium, meeting with prominent entrepreneurs including Ma.",
      "The meeting, coupled with DeepSeek\u2019s AI advancements, were among the factors that sparked renewed interest in the Chinese technology industry, sending technology stocks soaring in recent weeks.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s stock price is up more than 60% this year. Its U.S.-listed shares rose 8.5% in morning trading, to $136.58."

    "summary": "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
    "story": [
      "A bill to ban the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king",
      "LINCOLN, Neb. -- The prospect of banning the sale of so-called lab-grown meat might seem like a no-brainer in Nebraska, where beef is king, but some of the proposal's staunchest opposition has come from ranchers and farming groups who say they can compete without the government\u2019s help.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen \u2014 one of the largest pork producers in the country \u2014 is behind the push to ban cultivated meat, saying he wants to protect ranchers and meat producers. The Republican governor signed an executive order last August to keep state agencies and contractors from procuring lab-created meat, even though it could be years before such products are on store shelves.",
      "A number of ranchers and meat industry groups are pushing back on the governor's plan.",
      "Dan Morgan is a fourth-generation cattle rancher from central Nebraska who supplies high-end beef to all 50 states and six countries. He welcomes companies seeking to produce lab-grown meat to \u201cjump into the pool\u201d and try to compete with his Waygu beef. Stifling competition in a free market should be anathema in a Republican-dominated state like Nebraska, he said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,\u201d he said, adding that the government should be limited to regulating the new product's labels and inspecting its facilities to ensure food safety.",
      "\u201cAfter that, it's up to the consumer to make the decision about what they buy and eat.\u201d",
      "Nebraska is among about a dozen states that have introduced measures to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of lab-grown products, according to . Two states \u2014 Florida and Alabama \u2014 have already enacted such bans.",
      "The target of the bills is \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d or \u201ccell-cultured\u201d meat, which is grown from the cells of animals in bioreactor steel tanks. The cells are bathed for weeks in nutrients, prompting them to grow and divide, turning them into skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissues.",
      "The push to ban cultivated meat comes well before the innovation could be considered an industry. While more than two dozen companies are working to develop such meat products, only two \u2014 Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California \u2014 have been approved by the federal government to sell cultivated chicken in the U.S. Even then, none of the companies are close to mass producing and selling the products on store shelves.",
      "In recent weeks, supporters of the Nebraska bill have shifted their arguments from industry protection to questions of safety surrounding cell-cultured meat. That includes its sponsor, state Sen. Barry DeKay, a Nebraska rancher, and Sherry Vinton, the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Both testified in support of the bill at a committee hearing earlier this week, calling cultured meat \u201csynthetic food\u201d and voicing concern about possible health implications from eating it.",
      "But it's been no secret that the push for a ban is rooted in shielding Nebraska's traditional meat industry. Nebraska tops all other states for beef production and beef exports, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.",
      "Pillen named the ban among his top priorities during his State of the State address last month.",
      "\u201cThe backers of these products are cut from the same cloth as the anti-farmer activists who want to put our agriculture producers out of business, and we need to recognize them as such,\u201d he said.",
      "The Association for Meat, Poultry and Seafood Innovation, the lobbying group for the emerging cultured meat industry, disputes Pillen's insistence that it's a threat to the traditional meat industry, noting studies that show global demand for meat-based protein will double by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really a complementary component here,\u201d said Suzi Gerber, executive director of the association. \u201cSo it\u2019s a little bit mystifying to me why any individual stakeholder would see this as a threat.\u201d",
      "Several farm organizations, including Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Cattlemen and the Nebraska Pork Producers, agree they're not worried about competition from the emerging industry. Those groups prefer a sister bill that would only require they be clearly labeled as lab-grown products to separate them from traditional meat. More than a dozen states have also issued similar labeling bills, and some \u2014 like Colorado \u2014 have seen ban efforts abandoned in favor of labeling measures.",
      "Paul Sherman is an attorney with the Institute for Justice, which is representing Upside Foods in its lawsuit challenging the Florida ban. He said it's no surprise most of the proposed bans are being pushed by those with connections to traditional agriculture.",
      "\u201cI think it certainly shows that the purpose of these laws isn\u2019t about protecting public health and safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting traditional agriculture from economic competition. And that is not a legitimate use of government power.\u201d"

    "title": "Utah Republicans push to let patients supply their own blood as vaccine concerns linger",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:14:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

    "story": [
      "A new and massive study finds that climate change is melting the world\u2019s mountain glaciers faster than ever",
      "Climate change is accelerating the melting of the world's mountain glaciers, according to a massive new study that found them shrinking more than twice as fast as in the early 2000s.",
      "The world's glaciers lost ice at the rate of about 255 billion tons (231 billion metric tons) annual from 2000 to 2011, but that quickened to about 346 billion tons (314 billion metric tons) annually over about the next decade, according to the study in this week\u2019s journal Nature.",
      "And the last few years, the melt has accelerated even more, hitting a record 604 billion tons (548 billion metric tons) lost in 2023, the last year analyzed.",
      "The study drew on an international effort that included 233 estimates of changes in glacier weight. In all, the world's glaciers have lost more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) since 2000, according to the study.",
      "\u201cThe thing that people should be aware of and perhaps worried about is that yes, the glaciers are indeed retreating and disappearing as we said they would. The rate of that loss seems to be accelerating,\u201d said William Colgan, a glaciologist for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and one of about 60 authors of the study.",
      "Glaciers in Alaska are melting at the fastest rate of any of the 19 regions studied, losing about 67 billion tons (61 billion metric tons) of ice a year, producing the biggest net ice loss, the study found.",
      "In the past 24 years, Central Europe\u2019s glaciers have lost the highest percentage of ice of any region, now 39% smaller than they were in 2000, the paper said. Colgan said he worries most about the Alps because \u201celevated summer temperatures have been hammering the Alps. \u201d",
      "Fifteen years ago, scientists were worried most about the Andes and the Patagonia glaciers, but the Alps have shrunk so fast they could eventually disappear, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cGlaciers are apolitical and unbiased sentinels of climate change, and their decline paints a clear picture of accelerated warming,\u201d said Gwenn Flowers, a professor of Earth Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who also wasn't part of the study, said glaciers shrank and grew in the past for local, well-understood reasons that were not climate change. What's happening now is different and clear, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s due to greenhouse gas increases caused directly by coal, oil, and natural gas burning. ... No amount of rhetoric, tweeting, or proclamation will change that.\u201d",
      "Scambos, Flowers and other outside scientists called the assessment sobering and accurate but not surprising.",
      "Colgan said that many places \u2014 such as those in the U.S. West \u2014 are seeing extra water now from fast-melting glaciers and benefiting from that boost, but that will soon disappear as the glaciers melt beyond a point of no return.",
      "Melting glaciers contribute more to sea level rise than ice loss in either Greenland or Antarctica. Only the expansion of water as it warms plays a bigger role in sea level rise, the paper said.",
      "The overall glacier loss rate is similar, if maybe slightly less, than that found by earlier and less comprehensive studies. But this new work will probably trigger new predictions that will be even gloomier in the future because of better information and worsening warming, Colgan said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re losing 5.5% of the global ice volume in just over 20 years, clearly that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cThat's going to catch up with you.\u201d",
      "The more than 600 billion tons of glacier loss in 2023 \u201csounds incredible now, but it might sound pretty normal in 10 years from now,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cMountain glaciers as a whole can flip into collective ice loss pretty darn quick.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is investigating delays and cost overruns in California\u2019s high-speed rail project",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration is once again targeting California's controversial high-speed rail project, with federal transportation officials on Thursday announcing an investigation and possible withdrawal of about $4 billion in federal funding.",
      "Voters first approved $10 billion in bond money in 2008 for a project designed to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. It was slated to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020. But the project has been beset by funding challenges, cost overruns and delays.",
      "Now, state officials are focused on a 171-mile (275-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033. The entire San Francisco to Los Angeles line will now cost an estimated $106 billion to finish and officials hope to complete it in the next 20 years if there is money.",
      "\u201cI am directing my staff to review and determine whether the (California High-Speed Rail Authority) has followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding. If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference in Los Angeles.",
      "President Donald Trump canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail project in 2019, during his first term. The Biden administration later restored the funding and, in December 2023, allocated $3.3 billion more.",
      "Losing that money would be a major blow to the project. The rail authority's most recent business plan counts on receiving up to $8 billion in federal money to help close a funding gap.",
      "Ian Choudri, CEO of the California\u2019s High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees planning and funding for the project, said he welcomes the investigation.",
      "\u201cWith multiple independent federal and state audits completed, every dollar is accounted for, and we stand by the progress and impact of this project,\u201d Choudri said.",
      "He said the project has created nearly 15,000 jobs and that more than 50 major structures have been completed so far.",
      "Several Republican Congress members have taken aim at the project over its costs. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents 3rd Congressional District that stretches alongside much of the state\u2019s border with Nevada and includes Sacramento\u2019s northeastern suburbs, called the California high-speed rail \u201cthe worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "\"There is no plausible scenario where the cost to federal or state taxpayers can be justified. It is past time to stop throwing good money after bad, and we must formally end this project,\u201d said Kiley, who introduced a bill earlier this year to make the project ineligible for further federal funding.",
      "Kiley joined Duffy in Los Angeles' Union Station for the announcement of the probe. Those present were interrupted at times by booing by about 30 demonstrators. The protesters also chanted \u201cbuild the rail!\u201d and held up signs that read \u201cCA has no king\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t delay our train.\u201d",
      "Eli Lipmen, executive director of Move LA, an organization that advocates for efficient public transit systems, said the high-speed train project remains popular among many Californians.",
      "\u201cThey said they\u2019re going to start an investigation, but come on, this is a sham investigation,\u201d Lipmen, who was at Union Station during the announcement, told KABC-TV.",
      "Greg Regan and Shari Semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the Transportation Trades Department coalition that includes all the country's rail unions, said the project is the most ambitious and innovative transportation project in the country and urged Trump to become \u201ca Builder-in-Chief by bringing high-speed rail to America.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuilding ambitious projects requires bold leadership and a commitment to getting the job done. Just last year, President Trump complained that the United States does not have bullet trains similar to Japan. We agree with him that it is past time for our country to have these kinds of modern, efficient, high-capacity transportation systems,\" they said in a statement.",

      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",
      "The delays in making the iPhone\u2019s AI \u2014 dubbed \u201cApple Intelligence\u2019\" \u2014 more widely available through free software updates dinged the Cupertino, California, company during the past holiday when sales of the device dipped slightly from their 2023 levels.",
      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",

      "Chinese tech giant Huawei has held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Huawei on Tuesday held a global launch for the industry\u2019s first tri-foldable phone, which analysts said marked a symbolic victory for the Chinese tech giant amid U.S. technology curbs. But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",
      "\u201cRight now, Huawei kind of stands alone as an innovator\" with the trifold design, said Bryan Ma, vice president of device research with the market intelligence firm International Data Corporation.",
      "Huawei reached the position despite \u201cnot getting access to chips, to Google services. All these things basically have been huge roadblocks in front of Huawei,\u201d Ma said, adding that the \u201cresurgence we're seeing from them over the past year has been quite a bit of a victory.\"",
      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",
      "IDC's Ma said Huawei dominated the foldable phone market in China with 49% market share last year. In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "Why did humans start speaking",
      "Why did humans start speaking? Scientists suggest genetics played a big role \u2013 and they say the evolution of this singular ability was key to our survival.",
      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d she said.",

      "Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at the University of Thessaloniki, currently serves as the representative of two emergency committees that include scientists and officials from government, the military, and emergency services.",
      "He said Santorini, a volcanic island shaped by catastrophic eruptions, did not face danger from its dormant volcano, but noted that magma was affecting the tremors.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The Agriculture Department is scrambling to rehire several workers who were involved in the government's response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years.",
      "The workers were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on the recommendations of billionaire Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency, which is working to carry out Trump\u2019s promise to streamline and reshape the federal government.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon said the administration should be more careful in how it carries out the cuts.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump is fulfilling his promise to shed light on waste, fraud, and abuse in government, DOGE needs to measure twice and cut once. Downsizing decisions must be narrowly tailored to preserve critical missions,\u201d said Bacon, who represents a swing district in Nebraska.",
      "The bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus since the outbreak began in 2022. Most of the birds killed were egg-laying chickens, so that has driven egg prices up to a record high of $4.95 per dozen on average. The federal government has spent nearly $2 billion on the response, including nearly $1.2 billion in payments to farmers to compensate them for their lost birds.",
      "A USDA spokesperson said the department \u201ccontinues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\u201d and several key jobs like veterinarians, animal health technicians and other emergency response personnel involved in the effort were protected from the cuts. But some employees of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were eliminated.",
      "\u201cAlthough several APHIS positions supporting HPAI were notified of their terminations over the weekend, we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters,\u201d the department spokesperson said.",
      "Politico and NBC News reported that the jobs that were eliminated were part of an office that helps oversee the national network of labs USDA relies on to confirm cases of bird flu and other animal diseases. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "As U.S. tech titans ascend to prominent roles under President Donald Trump, the AP\u2019s findings raise questions about Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the future of automated warfare. Microsoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",

Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account.

Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas.

      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington.

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 08:00:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn\u2019t have success as the ocean conditions weren\u2019t allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\u201d Graham said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Mexico says it\u2019s awaiting a new response from Google to its request that the tech company fully restore the name Gulf of Mexico to its Google Maps service before filing a lawsuit",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico said Monday it's awaiting a new response from Google to its request that the tech company fully restore the name Gulf of Mexico to its Google Maps service before filing a lawsuit.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum shared a letter addressed to her government from Cris Turner, Google\u2019s vice president of government affairs and public policy. It says that Google will not change the policy it outlined after U.S. President Donald Trump declared the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",
      "Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line with Trump amid threats of tariffs and Mexico and other Latin American countries have braced themselves for promised mass deportations, the brunt of which has still not been felt.",
      "Along with the legal threat to Google, the Mexican president also announced Monday that Mexico and the U.S. would hold high-level meetings this week on trade and security in an effort to maintain a \u201clong-term plan of collaboration\" between the two countries.",
      "It's the latest round of talks between the two countries in which Mexico hopes to hold off a larger geopolitical crisis.",
      "The renaming of the water body has fueled strife within the U.S. as well.",
      "Last week, the White House barred Associated Press reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency\u2019s policy on the name. The AP is using Gulf of Mexico to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world but also acknowledging Trump\u2019s renaming of it as well.",

      "The firings at the Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias (CARD) affected roughly a tenth of the nearly 100 employees at the center, but in interviews with ABC News, workers there described a carefully woven web of collaboration that they say could be threatened by the layoffs of just a handful of employees, warning that it could jeopardize progress in answering key questions about dementia.",
      "Most shocking to CARD workers was the termination of lead researcher Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, who was announced internally as the organization's next acting director and was expected to bring significant advancements to the research field.",

The president campaigned on that process campaigned on that promise. Americans elected him on that promise, and he's actually delivering on it. And this is something that Democrats promised they would do for decades. President Trump is just the first president to get it done.\"",

      "\"We need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20 so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\" Kennedy said in November, speaking at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona.",
      "The firings at the Alzheimer's research center comes amid a flurry of other changes to the government's health agencies, including around 700 terminations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at least 90 more at the Food and Drug Administration of people who worked on nutrition, food safety and regulating infant formula, according to multiple officials at the agencies. There have also been cuts to other parts of HHS, including the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.",

      "\"I was three weeks shy of my probationary employment with the FAA, and I received an email late Friday night into Saturday morning, outlining my termination effective immediately,\" one of the FAA employees who was laid off told ABC News. \"It was a shock given the fact how critical my position was with public safety, with air travel.\"",

      "McCormick was interrupted multiple times as he tried to defend Trump and Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government and the thousands of firings across the United States.",
      "\"By and large, the president has great purview over where this money goes,\" McCormick said at one point, before the crowd started to shout him down. \"You can go and yell whenever you want, but I can't understand 10 people, let alone 100 people, at once.\"",

      "\"I'm a lifelong Republican,\" one constituent named Joel said, according to Alaska Public Radio. \"But I am in the majority, I think, with a lot of Americans, a lot of Alaskans, that are really concerned that we have an executive branch that is more than willing to push or remove the guardrails that are on the executive branch, and what we need from Congress and from the courts is to play that checks and balances role.\"",
      "\"Look, the Congress has certain roles and responsibilities. The executive does as well,\" said Begich, who noted he is a member of the \"DOGE caucus.\"",
      "\"And if the Congress or the executive branch steps outside of its constitutionally defined boundaries, the courts step in and realign and say, 'Hey, you're out of bounds,'\" he added. \"To the extent that the executive branch may or may not have exceeded that authority, there will be an opportunity in the courts for that to be challenged, and I would expect many of these challenges to be brought to the Supreme Court.\"",
      "Another constituent pressed Begich on this, asking in a post on the livestream, \"When are you going to express your authority to hold the president accountable to the Constitution?\"",
      "In the wake of the pandemic, many lawmakers haven't returned to holding traditional in-person town halls, preferring to reach a larger audience virtually while having more control over situations that melt down.",

      "\"They like the job that we're doing. They like the job that Elon is doing.

    "title": "Trump threatened 'all hell' if Hamas didn't free all its hostages. What happened?",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 08:59:35 -0500",
    "summary": "He hasn't repeated his ultimatum ahead of Saturday's planned release.",
    "story": [
      "He hasn't repeated his ultimatum ahead of Saturday's planned release.",
      "With Hamas saying it will release more hostages this weekend, President Donald Trump has yet to weigh in, as he did last week ahead of the planned Saturday hostage release threatening \"all hell is going to break out\" if all hostages weren't freed by his deadline.",
      "Last week, Trump demanded that if Hamas didn't release \"all of the hostages\" by noon last Saturday, Feb. 15, Israel's ceasefire with Hamas might end, although he wasn't clear whether he was suggesting the U.S. or Israel would act in response.",
      "His deadline came and went, and Hamas released the three hostages that were scheduled to be released on Feb. 15, including one American, according to the original ceasefire agreement, in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",
      "Experts told ABC News that Trump's comments made little or no difference in Saturday's outcome.",
      "\"Trump's threat wasn't much of an ultimatum, since Hamas was not about to release all of the hostages on Saturday under any scenario,\" said Guy Ziv, associate professor at American University's School of International Service.",
      "On the heels of this exchange, Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages early Thursday morning, though the Israel Defense Forces later said one of bodies does not belong to a hostage.",
      "What was the context?",
      "\"As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock, I think it's an appropriate time. I would say, cancel it and all bets are off, and let hell break out,\" Trump said last week. \"I'm speaking for myself. Israel can override it. But from myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock, and if they're not, they're not here, all hell is going to break out.\"",
      "The president's threats came after Hamas unexpectedly announced last week that it was delaying the next hostage release, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that violated the ceasefire deal. He later demanded all nine living Israeli hostages, who were supposed to be released during Phase 1 of the ceasefire deal, be released in the next few days, an Israeli official told ABC News last week.",
      "When asked last week about Trump's deadline and what he meant with his threat, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff did not go into detail but told \"CBS Mornings,\" \"I would take President Trump at his word. He generally means what he says ... so, I don't think it's a tactic.\"",
      "These exchanges also came a week after the announcement of Trump\u2019s Gaza plan, in which the president expressed his desire to \u201ctake over\u201d the Gaza Strip, relocate Palestinians, and redevelop the land. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres had responded to this plan, saying \"it is essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "The deadline passes",
      "Following the release of the hostages last Saturday, Trump turned to his social media platform to say it was up to Israel on how to move forward.",
      "\"Israel will now have to decide what they will do about the 12:00 O'CLOCK, TODAY, DEADLINE imposed on the release of ALL HOSTAGES,\" he wrote on Saturday. \"The United States will back the decision they make!\"",
      "Early Sunday morning, after a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu emphasized his \"cooperation and coordination\" with Trump.",
      "\"We have a common strategy,\" he said, \"including when the gates of hell will be open, as they surely will, if all our hostages are not released until the last one of them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump told reporters, \"I told Bibi, you do whatever you want because, you know my statement was they got to come back. Now, the reason I made that statement was because they said they weren't gonna deliver -- they were not going to deliver the people that they said they were going to deliver, that they agreed to deliver.\"",
      "\"When I made the statement, they delivered everybody, plus an American,\" Trump touted, appearing to take credit. In reality, the three hostages released Saturday were part of the ongoing ceasefire deal, including the release of American Sagui Dekel Chen on Feb. 15.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz repeated the president\u2019s sentiment during a press briefing Thursday.",
      "\u201cAnd when President Trump sent a very clear message across the Middle East, but particularly to Hamas, that there would be all hell to pay, we suddenly saw a breakthrough,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "But Trump's claims should not be considered the final word, says one expert.",
      "\"World leaders have learned to heavily discount the words of Donald Trump,\" Brian Katulis, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told ABC News. Katulis noted additional examples of the president's past comments that he says are filled with \"hot air,\" including Trump's assertion that he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day.",
      "Threatening 'hell' for months",
      "In fact, Trump has been threatening Hamas with \"hell\" for months.",
      "In early December, Trump wrote on his social media platform that \"there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East\" if hostages were not released prior to his Inauguration day, and that \"those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.\"",
      "\"If they're not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East,\" Trump repeated in January when asked about the status of the hostage deal.",
      "\"All hell will break out,\" he continued. \"I don't have to say any more, but that's what it is.\"",
      "Trump's language has been echoed by aides and supporters.",
      "Appearing on Fox News in December, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller warned, \"I would take him literally at his word. They will have hell to pay.\"",
      "Though he declined to go into specifics, Miller was confident that the president was \"very serious on this one.\"",
      "One day before Trump's inauguration, House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"there will be hell to pay for Hamas if they violate these terms.\"",
      "Experts remain skeptical of Trump's threats, despite their repetition throughout the past few months.",
      "\"The real hell that's broken loose is the hell of confusion that comes from Trump's erratic public statements here. It serves really no purpose,\" Katulis said, arguing that \"the real threat doesn't come from Trump's mouth, it comes from the weapons and bombs that Israel has.\"",
      "\"Some have likened Trump's coercive diplomacy to what [President Richard] Nixon called his 'Madman Theory,'\" Ziv said. \"Trump wants other leaders to believe that he's willing to do anything, that nothing can restrain him from achieving his objectives.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The budget resolution from Republicans was on the agenda in the Senate, but the late-night debate encompassed so much more.",
      "Democrats used the overnight session that ended early Friday morning as a platform for their outrage over what President Donald Trump has wrought during his first month in office, and their warnings of what is still to come.",
      "From the billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency slicing through the federal workforce to Trump\u2019s attacks on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the GOP plan to extend tax breaks including for the wealthy and cut safety net programs, far more than the $340 billion budget framework on border security and deportations came under scrutiny.",
      "Out of power in Washington, D.C., the Democrats instead brought to the Senate floor pages of amendments, keeping the chamber long into Thursday night and early Friday morning.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t send us here to make their lives worse. But that\u2019s exactly what Trump and Musk are doing,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., launching the debate.",
      "\u201cThey are looking at our most pressing problems \u2014 and making them so much worse. And this budget proposal will only add fuel to the fire.\"",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, test-drove a new term \u2014 \u201cTrumpflation\u201d \u2014 and asked what in the president\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful, bill\u201d would help Americans.",
      "\u201cTake this plan and put it in the \u2018woodchipper,\u2019\u201d Merkley said, repurposing Musk\u2019s quip about chopping up the federal government. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2018beautiful\u2019 about destroying programs families depend on.\"",
      "As the \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d dragged into the wee hours Democrats proposed amendments to bar tax breaks for billionaires and millionaires, reverse DOGE firings of public workers and program cuts to government services, preserve Medicaid, help Ukraine and on and on.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado offered an amendment to reinstate the fired federal employees at the Forest Service, National Park Service and other public lands agencies.",

      "But none of them were being approved.",
      "Still, Democrats preferred talking about almost anything but Trump's plans for deporting immigrants and beefing up border security, the main provisions of the $340 billion budget framework, which also includes funding for the Pentagon and Coast Guard.",
      "Those immigration-related issues divide the Democrats, who struggled during the fall election to counter Trump's deportation plans and still have not formed a ready response.",
      "Republicans happily pointed out the disconnect as they marched their budget framework to passage. It was approved, 52-48, on a mostly party-line vote, a key step in the budget process. One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, opposed it, as did all Democrats.",
      "The package now must sync up with one from the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is working up Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d with some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Nearing daybreak, when Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., offered an amendment to prevent \u201cunvetted and unaccountable\u201d DOGE workers to access Americans' private information in government databases, Republicans brought it down on a voice vote, with a thundering no.",
      "After the various prohibitions on billionaire tax breaks didn't pass, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tried to block breaks for those earning $10 million. It was turned back. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona suggested the cap be set at $100 million. It failed. Sen. Angus King of Maine tried $500 million. Nope.",
      "GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana assessed the whole evening as comparable to \u201cprofessional wresting\u201d and chided Democrats for drifting off topic. He said the bill was about border security not the tax cuts, which would be addressed later.",
      "At the start of the evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a former chairman of the Budget committee, spent some time discussing his own ideas, including his plan to expand Social Security benefits and extend Medicare health care coverage to provide seniors with access to dental, vision and hearing aid benefits.",
      "The Vermont senator said it's unacceptable that millions of seniors can't afford eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures.",
      "\u201cThat should not be happening in the United States of America in the year 2025,\" Sanders said.",
      "Then he zeroed in on Trump's remarkable suggestion it was Ukraine that started the war, rather than Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d an incredulous Sanders asked, urging fellow senators to speak out. \u201cThat is, as I hope every member of the Senate knows, an absolute lie.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says \u201cnobody has ever seen anything\u201d like his administration\u2019s sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government",
      "OXON HILL, Md. -- President Donald Trump said Saturday that \u201cnobody's ever seen anything\" like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government, congratulating himself for \u201cdominating\u201d Washington and sending bureaucrats \u201cpacking.\u201d",
      "Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside the nation's capital, Trump promised, \u201cWe\u2019re going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.\u201d",
      "The president argues that voters gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and extending tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration.",
      "Trump clicked easily back into campaign mode during his hour-plus speech, predicting that the GOP will continue to win and defy history, which has shown that a president\u2019s party typically struggles during midterm elections. He insisted of Republicans, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been at this level, maybe ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody's ever seen anything like this,\" Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf \u2014 which he said gives him confidence for the fifth hole.",
      "Trump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire suggested Saturday that more might be coming.",
      "\u201cConsistent with President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,\u201d Musk posted on X, which he owns. \u201cFailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d",
      "Later, an \u201cHR\u201d email was sent to federal workers across numerous agencies titled \u201cWhat did you do last week\u201d and asking that recipients \u201creply with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\u201d It cautioned against sending classified information, and gave a deadline of Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.",
      "Trump also said during the speech that he'd carry out harsher immigration policies. But those efforts have so far largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one entity with a workforce that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials.",
      "\u201cThe agency\u2019s name has been removed from its former building,\u201d he said.",
      "The president also repeated his previous promises to scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox.",
      "\u201cWould anybody like to join us?\u201d he asked to cheers from the crowd at the suggestion that administration forces might converge on the complex. \u201cWe want to see if the gold is still there.\u201d",
      "But Trump also devoted large chunks of his address to reliving last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 his Election Day opponent \u2014 gleefully proclaiming, \u201cI haven\u2019t said that name in a while.\u201d",
      "He went on to use an expletive to describe Biden\u2019s handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language.",
      "Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying \u201cI happen to like\u201d him, while saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.\u201d",
      "On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and another atendee, Argentine President Javier Milei.",
      "Trump called Duda \u201ca fantastic man and a great friend of mine\u201d and said \u201cyou must be doing something right, hanging out with Trump.\" He noted that Milei was \u201ca MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.\"",
      "Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine.",
      "Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. Trump is meeting on Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Trump also has begun a public tiff with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a \u201cdictator\u201d while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war \u2014 though on Friday Trump acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor.",
      "Trump told the CPAC crowd, \u201cI\u2019m dealing with President Zelenskyy. I\u2019m dealing with President Putin\u201d and added of fighting in Ukraine, \"It affects Europe. It doesn\u2019t really affect us.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy has said Trump is living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\u201d",
      "For much of the time since Russia invaded in February 2022, the United States, under Biden, pledged that Ukraine would play in any major effort to end the fighting, vowing \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201d Trump's administration has dispensed with that notion, as the Republican president has accelerated his push to find an endgame to the war.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal,\u201d Trump said Saturday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt subsequently told reporters that Trump and his team were focused on negotiations to end the war and \u201cthe President is very confident we can get it done this week,\u201d though such a tight timeline seems difficult.",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds.",
      "The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",
      "Later, Trump hosted a formal dinner at the White House for governors from around the country who were in Washington for a meeting of the National Governors Association. Trump said Republicans and Democrats can always call him and joked that he might address Democratic concerns first.",
      "\u201cLet us all recommit ourselves to strengthening America and making it something even more special than it has been,\" Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be one united nation, and maybe together, this is going to be easier if we start uniting.\"",
      "The president, who wore a tuxedo and bow tie, was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, who had her own tuxedo but no tie. Trump told those gathered that his wife helped organize the event.",
      "\u201cShe worked very hard on making sure everything was beautiful,\u201d he said to applause.",
      "Trump also said he'd give a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom after the meal to anyone who wished to see it.",
      "\u201cI think maybe it's like the most important room in the whole country,\" he said. \u201cThe most important bedroom definitely.\u201d",

      "New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday.",
      "Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.",
      "The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.",
      "Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI.",
      "ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.",
      "The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.",
      "The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was \u201ctargeting gun owners.\u201d Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the \u201chighest honor\u201d of her career.",
      "Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.",
      "In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms \u201cto assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.\u201d",
      "Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a \u201cknown gun rights extremist.\u201d Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director \u201ca major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide.\"",
      "The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to be the top U.S. military officer, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, endeared himself to the commander in chief through his military call sign, \u201cRazin,\u201d during a meeting in Iraq years ago. Officials who have served with Caine described him Saturday as measured and apolitical.",
      "Trump said Friday night that Caine was his pick as the next Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, making the announcement in the same social media post in which he fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who had held that job for 16 months after a career as a history-making fighter pilot.",
      "Brown's ouster \u2014 followed soon by that of other military leaders \u2014 came as Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are pushing out officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The new Republican administration says it is focused on a lethal fighting force.",
      "Caine retired in December. It was not immediately clear what it would take to recall him to active-duty service so he could go through Senate confirmation.",
      "Caine does not meet the position's prerequisites, such as being a combatant commander or service chief, as laid out in a 1986 law that does allow a president to waive those requirements.",
      "\u201cI know he\u2019s nontraditional, but that\u2019s kind of what this administration looks for,\u201d said Chris Miller, who served as Trump\u2019s last acting secretary of defense in his first term.",
      "Caine \"definitely knows how the Pentagon works,\u201d Miller told The Associated Press. Caine has experience, too, in the National Guard and has worked in the private sector.",
      "\u201cHe's spent time as a citizen-soldier. The guy's been out, done other things. He brings a perspective that is not traditional for a chairman, which I think will be a breath of fresh air,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Caine dates to his first administration. They met during a trip to Iraq, as Trump recounted during a 2019 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, where he spoke again on Saturday.",
      "Trump said he asked Caine why it would take two more years to end the fight against the Islamic State group. Caine told him it could be as little as a week, if he did it his way.",
      "\u201c'We\u2019re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria,'\" Trump said Caine told him. \u2018\"But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over \u2014 from the base that you\u2019re right on, right now, sir. They won\u2019t know what the hell hit them.\u2019\"",
      "A question after Brown\u2019s firing was whether Trump was seeking a loyalist as chairman of the Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump praised Caine \u2014 and condemned the current military leadership \u2014 at an unrelated appearance in Miami this past week.",
      "\u201cGeneral \u2018Razin\u2019 Caine was \u2014 he\u2019s some general. He\u2019s a real general, not a television general,\u201d Trump said Wednesday, two days before his Truth Social post.",
      "\u201cWe have the greatest military in the world, but we don\u2019t have the greatest top, top leadership. That\u2019s why Afghanistan was such a horrible situation and so embarrassing and so many other things,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut when we want to, with proper leadership, there\u2019s nobody even close to us.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously suggested that Caine is a political supporter. In a CPAC speech last year, Trump recalled meeting Caine in 2018 in Iraq when he was visiting troops.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll kill for you sir,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThen he puts on a \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 hat.\u201d",
      "But Caine has been steadfastly apolitical, a military officer who had served with him and remains close to him said Saturday.",
      "\u201cGen. Caine doesn\u2019t have a MAGA hat. He\u2019s never put one on,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to talk to the media on the record and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Miller, the former acting defense secretary, served at the Pentagon when Caine led the military\u2019s Special Access Program Central Office, which oversees what classified information on weapons programs is shared with foreign governments.",
      "That position \u201cis one of the most difficult places to work in the whole department because of all of the congressional interest. You have to be really, really adept to handle all of the constituencies,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Caine, like Brown, flew F-16 fighter jets. Last month, Caine completed an assignment for the CIA, and during an in-depth Jan. 27 episode of \u201cThe Afterburn Podcast\u201d spoke at length about his life and career.",
      "\u201cI grew up as the son of a fighter pilot. This was our family business,\u201d he said. Both he and his father, who started his military career flying F-4 Phantoms, ultimately flew the F-16.",
      "In the podcast, Caine had a message for young people looking to serve, or those already flying: \u201cCherish it,\u201d Caine said.",
      "\u201cAnd remember that while flying airplanes in the military at least is epically cool, it's about something deeper,\" he said. \"It's about serving our country. It's about being willing to protect and defend this nation.\u201d",

      "Yosemite is home to giant sequoia trees and a haven for myriad wildlife species. El Capitan, a 3,000-foot (914-meter) wall of sheer granite and possibly the world\u2019s most fabled rock face, attracts climbers from around the world. Such majestic qualities also are what attracted people to work at the beloved park that is a destination for families from California and throughout the country.",
      "The Trump administration last week fired about 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees who maintain and clean parks, educate visitors and perform other functions as part of its broad-based effort to downsize government.",

      "Coastal Carolina University President Michael Benson has been extended an offer to become West Virginia University\u2019s next president, where he would be tasked with reversing decade-long declining enrollment at the state\u2019s flagship university.",
      "Coastal Carolina made the announcement in a message to its campus community on Friday night, a day after West Virginia University announced that its Board of Governors had approved its next president but would not disclose a name until after a contract was signed.",
      "Officials at either school haven't said whether Benson accepted the offer, although Coastal Carolina said its board has called a committee to initiate a search for Benson's replacement.",
      "\u201cWhile we will certainly miss President Benson, I believe that his work, along with the work of the board and the University faculty and staff, has positioned us for tremendous opportunities in the days ahead,\u201d Coastal Carolina board Chairman H. Delan Stevens said.",
      "Benson would replace E. Gordon Gee, the Morgantown school\u2019s longest-serving president who announced during a budget crisis in August 2023 that he would retire when his contract expires in June 2025.",
      "Benson, who turns 60 next Friday, has been Coastal Carolina\u2019s president for four years in Conway, South Carolina. He previously served as president at Eastern Kentucky University, Southern Utah University and Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, where at 36 he became the youngest college president in the history of the Utah System of Higher Education. A history professor, Benson has taught at each institution where he\u2019s served as president.",
      "Known as a deft fundraiser, Benson helped Snow became the first junior college athletic program in the country to be sponsored by Nike, and Benson raised more money in five years than the school had in its previous 115-year history, according to the Deseret News. In 2022, Coastal Carolina received its largest-ever gift, $10 million from Conway Medical Center.",
      "Benson also has prioritized civic engagement with a long history of serving on committees and boards, including the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Ten years ago at Eastern Kentucky, a student who was frustrated that school had not been called off after a snowstorm joked on the social platform X that he wouldn\u2019t attend class until Benson shoveled his driveway. Benson showed up less than a hour later, cleared the driveway and shared a meal with the student and his family.",
      "Benson has degrees from Brigham Young University, Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins and the University of Oxford in England. Benson played varsity basketball at Oxford, where he and current U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey were teammates.",
      "Like Gee, Benson was born in Utah and is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Gee, 81, is in his second stint at West Virginia that began in 2014.",
      "When Gee announced his retirement, the university addressed a $45 million budget shortfall by raising tuition, dropping about 8% of its majors and cutting about 5% of faculty positions.

      "Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei is urging conservatives to keep supporting measures to shrink the size of government",
      "OXON HILL, Md. -- Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei on Saturday urged an enthusiastic crowd of U.S. conservatives to keep supporting measures to shrink the size of their government, saying his methods are similar to those undertaken by President Donald Trump and close ally Elon Musk.",
      "Milei is the man behind the chainsaw waved effusively onstage by Musk, in perhaps the most memorable single moment at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, held in suburban Maryland.",
      "In a Saturday speech in Spanish, Milei expressed support for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, saying it is out of line with the president\u2019s agenda and claiming it was wasteful.",
      "\u201cThe only rational path is to shrink the size of the state as much as possible,\u201d Milei said. \u201cReducing the size of the State is in itself an act of justice.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his remarks at the gathering, praised Milei. \u201cWe're very proud of you,\u201d he said.",
      "Milei quoted in his speech an influential libertarian intellectual from Pennsylvania, Albert J. Nock, who wrote in his 1935 book \u201cOur Enemy, the State\u201d about the struggle between state power and social power.",
      "\u201cOur method is similar to that of our dear friend Elon Musk,\u201d Milei said. \u201cTo go office by office, keep in place what is working and get rid of the rest. That\u2019s why I gave him a chainsaw.\u201d",
      "The Argentine leader used a different chainsaw as a prop during his 2023 campaign to symbolize his proposals to shred the bloated state. The red chainsaw gifted to Musk was engraved with Milei\u2019s slogan \u201cViva la libertad, carajo,\u201d which is Spanish for \u201cLong live liberty, damn it.\u201d",
      "When Musk first began toying with the idea of forming a taskforce to downsize the federal workforce during an interview with Trump on X last August, they both talked about the Argentine leader. Musk praised his extreme austerity measures that had laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers and cut pensions to reverse spending that caused the country to default on its debts.",
      "Milei also attended CPAC last year and met with Trump backstage, exchanging a close hug. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election, but before he took office. Milei was also invited to the inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "In a video message later Saturday, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni defended the central role of Europe and its crucial relationship with the United States.",
      "\u201cI know you can perceive Europe as distant and lost, but I can tell you it\u2019s not,\u201d said Meloni, who is seen as a key Trump ally in Europe.",
      "She reaffirmed her support for Kyiv, saying Ukrainians are bravely fighting against \u201ca brutal aggression\u201d from Moscow.",
      "Trump sent top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials on Tuesday that did not include Ukrainian or European officials. Trump has falsely suggested that Ukraine started war, though on Friday he acknowledged that Moscow had attacked its neighbor. Russia launched its invasion in Febrary 2022.",
      "Before his address, Trump met with Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, praising Poland's commitment to increase defense spending and acknowledging the countries' close alliance, according to the White House.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered the release of a Hawaii man who was imprisoned for 30 years for a murder he says he didn\u2019t commit",
      "HONOLULU -- A judge on Friday ordered the release of a Hawaii man who was imprisoned for 30 years for a murder he has long said he didn't commit.",
      "New evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the results of another trial against Gordon Cordeiro, Judge Kirstin Hamman ruled Friday in vacating his convictions and life sentence.",
      "There were gasps and cries in the courtroom when Hamman said, \u201cAnd the judgement and sentence is vacated and the defendant is ordered to be released from custody,\u201d before a Zoom feed broadcasting the hearing suddenly turned off.",
      "In 1994, a man was murdered on Maui during a drug deal robbery. Cordeiro would eventually be found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "The Hawaii Innocence Project took up his case and during a hearing earlier this week argued Cordeiro must be released on the grounds of new evidence proving his innocence, ineffectiveness of his previous attorney and prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin didn't immediately return a phone message seeking comment after the judge ordered Cordeiro's release.",
      "Kenneth Lawson, co-director of the Hawaii Innocence Project, said he was waiting for Cordeiro, now 51, to be processed and released from custody after the hearing.",
      "\u201cIt was very, very emotional. He cried, we all cried,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHe believed that he was going to be exonerated ... but having gone through two trials you lose faith in the justice system. To finally hear a judge say \u2018I\u2019m vacating your convictions,\u2019 that\u2019s when it hit him.\u201d",
      "According to court documents filed by Cordeiro\u2019s attorneys, he was wrongfully convicted for the shooting death of Timothy Blaisdell partly because police relied upon four jailhouse informants. They say those informants were motivated by promises of reduced sentences and concocted a fabricated murder-for-hire plot. The plot, they say, claimed Cordeiro tried to arrange the killing of the man who tried to pin the death on Cordeiro due to a previous dispute.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately for Cordeiro, the State\u2019s use of incentivized jailhouse informants and their fabricated evidence and testimony about the murder-for-hire plots, was enough to convince a jury of his guilt in his second trial,\u201d the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court filing.",
      "The first trial against Cordeiro ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him.",
      "Cordeiro had several alibi for the day Blaisdell was killed, his attorneys said: The then 22-year-old was at home with his parents and sisters, spending the day building a shelving unit in his family's open-air garage and installing a stereo in his sister's car. He was nowhere near the area known as \u201cSkid Row\u201d in upcountry Maui where Blaisdell was killed.",
      "Blaisdell had gone to Skid Row with a man named Michael Freitas, where Blaisdell planned to buy a pound of marijuana with $800 in cash, according to court documents. Blaisdell's body was found at the bottom of a ravine there.",
      "Freitas kept changing his story, Cordeiro's attorneys said, and shifted the blame onto Cordeiro, a friend he falsely believed had \u201csnitched\u201d on him in an unrelated drug case.",
      "After Cordeiro's conviction, new testing on physical evidence from the scene excluded Cordeiro as the source of DNA on Blaisdell's body and other crime scene evidence, and found there was a DNA profile of an unidentified person on the inside pockets of Blaisdell's jeans, the Hawaii Innocence Project said.",
      "Cordeiro's attorneys believe Freitas set up Blaisdell to get robbed and was involved in his killing. Freitas died in 2020, Lawson said.",
      "The judge agreed that the new DNA evidence and new information about gunshot residue would change the results of a later trial.",
      "\u201cThe police botched this case from the beginning and turned the No. 1 suspect into the state's star witness, resulting in a 30-plus-year nightmare and miscarriage of justice for Gordon and his family,\u201d Lawson said."

Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part.\"",

      "\u201cAt 94, it won\u2019t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a \u201creport\u201d is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners.

      "\"But I\u2019ve also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as the ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single winning decision can make a breathtaking difference over time. (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a managerial decision and my luck in finding Charlie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal advisor and steadfast friend.)",

So, too, with personal skills. Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities throughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will continue to do so.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family\u2019s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times.\u201d",

      "\"Our country\u2019s progress over its mere 235 years of existence could not have been imagined by even the most optimistic colonists in 1789, when the Constitution was adopted and the country's energies were unleashed.",
      "\"True, our country in its infancy sometimes borrowed abroad to supplement our own savings. But, concurrently, we needed many Americans to consistently save and then needed those savers or other Americans to wisely deploy the capital thus made available. If America had consumed all that it produced, the country would have been spinning its wheels.",
      "\"The American process has not always been pretty \u2013 our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance \u2013 which remains in full force today \u2013 and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.",

      "\"Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities \u2013 mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned.",
      "\u201cPaper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country\u2019s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.\u201d"

      "The Virginia legislature has ended its 45-day session by addressing a slew of budget amendments ranging from tax cuts to child care",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- The Virginia legislature ended its 45-day session Saturday with a slew of budget amendments ranging from tax cuts to child care, but some lawmakers said they would likely return to the Capitol later this year to address a mounting threat: massive federal government layoffs planned by the Trump administration.",
      "A federal judge paved the way this week for the layoffs to go forward, leaving officials in the state, which according to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments is home to roughly 315,000 federal workers, to begin assessing the impact of the job cuts.",
      "So far only a couple hundred federal employees have filed unemployment insurance claims with the Virginia Employment Commission since the beginning of the month, authorities said Saturday during the first meeting of a newly formed bipartisan committee studying the impact of the cuts.

      "\u201cThis affects real families who have been put into a situation that they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be put in,\u201d said Democratic Del. David Bulova, who chairs the new committee. He added: \u201cThese are kitchen-table issues.\u201d",

      "Before adjourning the legislative session, the House of Delegates voted on a resolution expanding a previously established special session, which is still active. Democrats said the maneuver would allow lawmakers to reconvene later this year. Senate Democrats did not pass the same resolution but pledged to do so in the coming weeks.",
      "Lawmakers also passed legislation amending the two-year budget, including dedicating funds to give each taxpayer a $200 rebate along with bonuses for state employees and teachers. The rebates are expected to arrive in mid-October, weeks before an election in which the top statewide offices are on the ballot.",
      "There was no budget amendment addressing what would happen if the federal match rate changes for Medicaid, as Congress weighs billions of dollars in the program. Virginia is one of nine states with a trigger law for swiftly ending Medicaid expansion if federal funding falls.",
      "The Virginia Senate's budget plan originally required an oversight subcommittee to meet before disenrolling Virginians, should such a scenario play out. But that item did not make its way to the joint General Assembly budget passed Saturday.",
      "The bill also ignored Youngkin\u2019s topline amendments, including language on making a permanent, refundable car tax credit of up to $150 for people earning under $50,000 a year and up to $300 for joint filers making less than $100,000. Also nixed was his proposal to cut taxes on tips.",
      "Now the budget amendments, along with hundreds of other bills, head to Youngkin\u2019s desk for the governor to sign, veto or seek amendments. Lawmakers will reconvene in April to consider proposed changes.",
      "Youngkin said in a statement that he would review the legislation over the next 30 days and there would be \u201cmuch to address at the reconvene session.\u201d",
      "Many of the bills from the Democratic-led legislature are second attempts at measures Youngkin vetoed last spring, including eliminating a tax exemption for the Daughters of the Confederacy.",
      "Lawmakers also passed legislation tackling maternal health disparities among people of color, such as covering postpartum doula visits for those with Medicaid.",

      "\u201cConsistent with President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,\u201d Musk posted on X, which he owns. \u201cFailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d",
      "Shortly afterward, federal employees \u2014 including some judges, court staff and federal prison officials \u2014 received a three-line email with this instruction: \u201cPlease reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\"",
      "The deadline to reply was listed as Monday at 11:59 p.m., although the email did not include Musk's social media threat about those who fail to respond.",
      "The latest unusual directive from Musk's team injects a new sense of chaos across beleaguered multiple agencies, including the National Weather Service, the State Department and the federal court system, as senior officials worked to verify the message's authenticity Saturday night and in some cases, instructed their employees not to respond.",
      "Thousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce \u2014 either by being fired or offered a buyout \u2014 during the first month of Trump\u2019s administration as the White House and Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency fire both new and career workers, tell agency leaders to plan for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d and freeze trillions of dollars in federal grant funds.",
      "There is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but The Associated Press has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside of Washington. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.",
      "Labor union leaders quickly condemned the ultimatum and threatened legal action.",
      "AFGE President Everett Kelley called the new order an example of Trump and Musk's \u201cutter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" Kelley said. \u201cAFGE will challenge any unlawful terminations of our members and federal employees across the country.\u201d",
      "Musk on Friday celebrated his new role at a gathering of conservatives by waving a giant chainsaw in the air. He called it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy\u201d and said, \u201cWaste is pretty much everywhere\u201d in the federal government.",
      "McLaurine Pinover, a spokesperson at the Office of Personnel Management, confirmed Musk's directive and said that individual agencies would \"determine any next steps.\u201d",
      "What happens if an employee is on leave or vacation? Again, she said individual agencies would determine how to proceed.",
      "In a message to employees on Saturday night, federal court officials instructed recipients not to respond.",
      "\u201cWe understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email ... directing the recipient to reply with 5 accomplishments from the prior week. Please be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken,\" officials wrote.",
      "Judges around the country got emails from Musk's team in late January, apparently by mistake, U.S. District Judge Randolph Daniel Moss said earlier this month. Moss said he\u2019d also gotten a message and ignored it.",
      "The National Weather Service leadership acknowledged some confusion in a message to its employees late Saturday as well.",
      "\u201cWithin the last few hours, some of us \u2014 potentially all of us -- received an email message titled \u2018What did you do last week?\u2019 Until such time as we can verify that the message that was received at or around 4:46pm ET is authentic, please do not respond.\u201d",
      "National Weather Service leadership continued: \"Thank you all for your continued support and dedication ensuring public safety and the national security of our country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has largely blocked sweeping executive orders from President Donald Trump that sought to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday largely blocked sweeping executive orders from President Donald Trump that seek to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from terminating or changing federal contracts they consider equity-related.",
      "Abelson found that the orders likely carry constitutional violations, including against free-speech rights.",
      "Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don\u2019t promote DEI.",
      "The White House didn\u2019t immediately return a message seeking comment Friday evening.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups \u2014 sued the Trump administration earlier this month, arguing the executive orders are unconstitutional and a blatant overreach of presidential authority. They also allege the directives have a chilling effect on free speech.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is an overcorrection and pulling back on DEI statements,\u201d attorney Aleshadye Getachew said during a nearly three-hour hearing Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws. Attorneys for the government said the administration should be able to align federal spending with the president\u2019s priorities.",
      "\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the obligation to subsidize plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of speech,\u201d said Justice Department attorney Pardis Gheibi.",
      "Abelson, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses, organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cThe harm arises from the issuance of it as a public, vague, threatening executive order,\u201d he said during the hearing.",
      "Abelson\u2019s ruling does allow for the attorney general to investigate and prepare a report on DEI practices in accordance with one of the orders, but it blocks enforcement.",
      "In his written opinion, Abelson found reason to believe the orders are unconstitutionally vague, leaving federal contractors and grant recipients with \u201cno reasonable way to know what, if anything, they can do to bring their grants into compliance.\u201d",
      "He described a hypothetical scenario where an elementary school received Department of Education funding for technology access and a teacher used a computer to teach about Jim Crow laws. Or if a road construction grant covered the cost of filling potholes in a low-income neighborhood instead of a wealthy neighborhood, \u201cdoes that render it \u2018equity-related\u2019?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "Efforts to increase diversity have been under attack for years by Republicans who contend the measures threaten merit-based hiring, promotion and educational opportunities for white people. However, supporters say the programs help institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse populations while addressing the lasting impacts of systemic racism.",
      "Their purpose was to foster equitable environments in businesses and schools, especially for historically marginalized communities. Although researchers say DEI initiatives date back to the 1960s, more were launched and expanded in 2020 during increased calls for racial justice.",
      "Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued in their complaint that Trump\u2019s efforts to abruptly end such programs will cause widespread harm, not least because of the vague language in his executive orders.",
      "\u201cOrdinary citizens bear the brunt,\u201d they wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs and their members receive federal funds to support educators, academics, students, workers, and communities across the country. As federal agencies make arbitrary decisions about whether grants are \u2018equity-related,\u2019 Plaintiffs are left in limbo.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs include the city of Baltimore, which receives federal funds for public safety, housing, the environment, infrastructure and more, according to the complaint.",
      "Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, has championed efforts to increase opportunities for the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents, including people of color. Scott became the subject of racist attacks online last year as some commenters labeled him a \u201cDEI mayor,\u201d and he recently coined the phrase \u201cDefinitely Earned It\u201d to highlight the accomplishments of Black figures throughout history.",
      "In addition to the mayor and the Baltimore City Council, the plaintiffs include the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, the American Association of University Professors and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which represents restaurant workers across the country.",
      "Their attorneys claim the groups are already suffering the effects of the executive orders as Trump encroaches on the powers of Congress and seeks to suppress views he doesn\u2019t agree with.",
      "\u201cBut the President simply does not wield that power,\u201d they wrote in the complaint. \u201cAnd contrary to his suggestions otherwise, his power is not limitless.\u201d"

      "The Jefferson County Coroner\u2019s Office issued a statement late Friday identifying the victims from earlier in the day as ranging in age from 18 to 33 years old. Officers who responded around noon Friday found one man dead at the scene and two wounded women, who later died after being taken to a hospital, according to Louisville Metro Police Department.",

Jalen Eddings told WHAS-TV that he had gone to the office but went back to his car to wait out the long line when the shooting unfolded nearby.

      "Numerous police responded to the shooting at a state Driver Licensing Office on the southern outskirts of Louisville. Police evidence markers were set on the ground around an area about 20 feet (about six meters) from the entrance to the building Friday afternoon.",
      "Police Maj. Donald Boeckman said Friday that the shooter left in a vehicle. Boeckman did not have a description of the vehicle and said investigators were still reviewing surveillance video.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Ceiba Phillips, 11, couldn't believe what he saw when he returned to his Southern California neighborhood a month after a wildfire reduced it to rubble.",
      "The ruins of his best friend\u2019s house and his beloved school. His house survived, but the backhouse where his grandparents lived and packed him lunch every morning was reduced to ashes and a silver pool of melted aluminum. His favorite cozy diner, Fox's, was decimated.",
      "Seeing it in person \u2014 after seeing it through photos \u2014 brought shock and tears.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not even a word created for it,\u201d Ceiba said. \u201cIt's sad, it's heavy, somewhat angry. Why did this have to happen?\u201d",
      "The Eaton fire that tore through Altadena on Jan. 7 left parents and children alike to deal with the trauma of one of the most destructive fires in California history. As people return to their neighborhoods, many kids are navigating the grief of losing everything that was familiar. Their parents, meanwhile, are learning how to help them cope.",
      "Children thrive on routine, and reestablishing one as quickly as possible is key to helping kids cope, said Lori Peek, a sociology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the impact of natural disasters. It\u2019s essential for kids to stay connected with their friends, and for parents to have honest conversations with them about the difficulty of what they are facing.",
      "\u201cBeing honest about our own emotions and opening up, but then being very inviting for children to share what they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re grieving, what they\u2019re experiencing, that can be one way to start those really important conversations,\u201d Peek said.",
      "It's this kind of space that Chiara Angelicola, who works in early childhood education, was trying to create when she organized a Kids Town Hall event for families affected by the fires. Children had the opportunity to share how they felt and participate in art and somatic therapy exercises, which focus on how trauma can affect the body. Ceiba's 4-year-old sister, Quoia, went with their mother, Alyson Granaderos, along with more than 100 other kids and parents.",
      "\u201cA lot of these kids had a lot to say ... and some of it even made the adults uncomfortable,\u201d Angelicola said. \u201cI think that exercise in learning how to be uncomfortable experiencing certain feelings is very necessary for children because we\u2019re modeling for them that feelings won\u2019t hurt us.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of therapists and non-profits also have offered their mental health services for free to victims of the fires.",
      "Ceiba's home was one of about six on his street that wasn't destroyed, but it sustained so much smoke damage it's not livable right now. On a recent day, the family carefully entered wearing respirator masks and protective equipment.",
      "Ceiba looked out his bedroom window and said he didn't care that his house had survived. \u201cI'd rather have all of Altadena,\u201d he said.",
      "Ceiba remembers every detail of his last normal day.",
      "School let out early due to intense Santa Ana winds that fueled the fires. He and his sister went to Ceiba\u2019s best friend\u2019s house. They played on a trampoline, drew comics, and chucked LEGO figurines off the balcony.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably been to his house more than 2,000 times,\u201d Ceiba said.",
      "That evening, the family received a text message from Ceiba\u2019s grandma asking if they saw the fire that had broken out nearby. They ran to their window and saw the whole mountainside ablaze.",
      "\u201cI was on the floor like praying, please protect my house and my family. And you know, mom\u2019s like, \u2018Come on, you got to get up, pack your stuff,\u2019\u201d Ceiba said.",
      "The 11-year-old sprang into action, dumping his clothes and quarters into his bag and packing for his younger sister.",
      "They sheltered in their dad\u2019s office in neighboring Pasadena. Ceiba could barely sleep. By the morning, much of his neighborhood was gone.",
      "Ceiba's days have taken on a rhythm again, even at his new school in Pasadena.",
      "When he greeted his mom on a recent afternoon, he shared a fun fact he'd learned that day: In 1846, a future president, Abraham Lincoln, had almost joined the ill-fated Donner Party as it set out from Springfield, Illinois, on its infamous journey out West, only to get trapped in California's Sierra Nevada.",
      "Ceiba has decided to play the saxophone in band class, and his state project will be on Michigan, where his mom is from. Granaderos said her son already seems to be adapting.",
      "But his conversations with friends now veer into unusual topics for 11-year-olds.",
      "\u201cThe insurance isn\u2019t covering us and how\u2019s your house? How\u2019s this person\u2019s house?\u201d Ceiba said, sharing what he and his friends discuss.",
      "He wonders what will become of his community. He's optimistic though.",
      "\u201cI know Altadena and I know that it\u2019s going to stick together,\u201d Ceiba said.",
      "Ceiba had clamored right away to go back home after the fire, but Granaderos was hesitant. After the dust settled, she knew that allowing her kids to see and experience what happened was part of the healing process.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re facing this realization of certain conversations you have to start to have with your kid, right?\u201d Granaderos said. \u201cThere\u2019s beauty in the world, and there\u2019s also a lot of sadness and destruction.\u201d",
      "Quoia burst into tears when the family drove past what was left of The Bunny Museum in Pasadena dedicated to rabbits. She loved seeing the giant inflatable bunnies that loomed over the street corner nearly every day. Ceiba cried along with her.",
      "\u201cI just couldn\u2019t really take it,\u201d he said.",

      "A Hawaii man released after spending 30 years in prison for a murder he has always denied committing has spent his first day of freedom visiting his mother's gravesite and marveling at how much the world is different",
      "HONOLULU -- One of the first places Gordon Cordeiro visited when a judge ordered him released after spending 30 years in prison for a killing he always maintained he had nothing to do with was his mother\u2019s Hawaii gravesite.",
      "In a videoconference interview with The Associated Press on Saturday, Cordeiro reflected on his first day of freedom after new DNA evidence led to the overturning of his conviction in the 1994 shooting of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui.",
      "Paulette Cordeiro died in September 1994, and her son was arrested the following month.",
      "\u201cThanks for looking over me,\u201d the son recalled saying at her grave, hours after walking out of the Maui Community Correctional Center. \u201cKeeping me safe.\u201d",
      "A photo provided by his sister showed Cordeiro kneeling at their mother\u2019s grave, with a lei he was given upon release draped over the headstone. Inscribed on it were the words, \u201cYou were the wind beneath our wings.\u201d",
      "Cordeiro said he thought constantly about his mother \u2014 who died at age 49 from ALS, often called Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease \u2014 during his years behind bars. He and his sisters had taken turns caring for her, and he said he was with her and building shelving units for the family when Blaisdell was fatally shot during a drug deal robbery.",
      "After a steak dinner and the gravesite visit, he celebrated with family at his father\u2019s house and then found himself unable to sleep much. The following day he went to other relatives\u2019 graves and planned to go to Costco, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels normal,\u201d he said.",
      "But the Maui he once knew has changed a lot, Cordeiro said, noting that the historic town of Lahaina was destroyed by a wildfire in 2023.",
      "Another thing that has taken some getting used to: \u201cEverybody is looking at their phones.\u201d",
      "Cordeiro had just a pager before he went to prison, he said. He now has a smartphone, but \u201cI\u2019m not staring at it yet. It keeps beeping and messages coming in, and it\u2019s different.\u201d",
      "There were gasps and cries in the courtroom Friday when Judge Kirstin Hamman announced that his sentence was vacated and he was to be released from custody. She ruled that new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial.",
      "Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin says he plans to appeal and seek to have bail imposed on Cordeiro's release.",
      "Cordeiro\u2019s first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him. But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "After Cordeiro\u2019s conviction, new testing on physical evidence from the scene excluded him as the source of DNA on Blaisdell\u2019s body and other crime scene evidence, the Hawaii Innocence Project said, and a DNA profile of an unidentified person was found on the inside pockets of Blaisdell\u2019s jeans.",
      "The judge agreed.",
      "\u201cThank God for new DNA,\u201d Cordeiro said Saturday. \u201cTechnology is awesome.\u201d",
      "The Zoom interview with the AP was the first time he used the platform and an iPad outside of prison.",
      "Someone who knows what Cordeiro is going through reached out to him Friday to offer support in adjusting: Ian Schweitzer, who was freed in 2023 after more than 20 years for a 1991 killing and rape on the Big Island that he says he did not commit. The two met in prison at one point, according to Cordeiro.",
      "\u201cWe followed each other\u2019s cases as we were going along,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both living in the same prison, so we both kept up with each other as the process was going.\u201d",
      "For now, Cordeiro said, his immediate plans include fixing cars, helping with his dad's house and \u201cmaybe giving back to the community a little bit.\u201d"

      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",

      "Billing plans",
      "When Ofgem asked for the public's views on standing charges it received an unprecedented response of 30,000 submissions.",

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Chinese president Xi Jinping and some of the country's foremost business leaders this week has fuelled excitement and speculation, after Alibaba founder Jack Ma was pictured at the event.",
      "The charismatic and colourful Mr Ma, who was one of China's most prominent businessmen, had withdrawn from public life after criticising China's financial sector in 2020.",
      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",
      "The response has been overwhelmingly positive - tech stocks, including those of Alibaba, rallied soon after the event.",
      "On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported financial results that beat expectations, with shares ending the trading day in New York more than 8% higher. The company's shares are up 60% since the beginning of the year.",
      "So what are analysts reading into Mr Ma's appearance at the event alongside other high-profile guests - including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng?",
      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",
      "Analysts began looking for clues about the significance of the meeting as soon as Chinese state media started releasing pictures of the event.",
      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "UK inflation jumped sharply in the year to January, driven by rising food prices, air fares and an increase in private school fees.",
      "The higher-than-expected jump to 3% from 2.5% in December, means prices rose at the fastest pace for 10 months.",
      "Food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals were all more expensive than a year ago and comes as many households prepare for higher energy and water bills later this year.",
      "Following the latest figures, the government warned that the road back to low inflation would be \"bumpy\", but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats argued Labour's tax rises and spending plans had caused the latest spike.",
      "Rising food prices last month mean, on average, the cost of buying groceries is 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago.",
      "While many staples have edged up in price, some items such as olive oil and lamb have increased markedly, by 17% and 16% respectively.",

      "Water and council tax bills are also slated to rise in two months' time, which will push up the cost of living for households.",
      "The government has raised the minimum wage for all age groups from April. Benefits and the state pension will also increase.",

      "But with the rate remaining above the Bank's 2% target, some economists suggest further cuts could be made at a slower pace.",
      "Professor Jonathan Haskel, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told the BBC that policymakers could \"take no signal\" from the inflation spike and carry on cutting rates gradually or view it as a \"harbinger of more to come\" and change course.",

      "\"We are in a different world than we were a few years ago under the previous government, where inflation was routinely double digits,\"  he said.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",

      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",

      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",

    "summary": "Cornwall Insight predicts that the energy regulator will hike gas and electricity prices by 5%.",
    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to rise by 5% from April, adding \u00a385 a year to household bills, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight.",
      "The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay \u00a31,823 a year.",
      "The figures emerged as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband wrote an urgent letter to Ofgem, the regulator which sets the price cap, asking it to move quickly to protect consumers.",
      "The predicted higher prices will take effect at the same time as increases to water and council tax bills in April.",
      "However, minimum wage levels will also go up while benefits and the state pension will increase.",
      "Cornwall forecasts that the price cap will rise from its current level of \u00a31,738 per year for a typical household.",
      "Higher household bills are likely to add pressure to the government who are already facing criticism for removing the winter fuel allowance from elderly people not claiming the pension credit or other means-tested financial support.",
      "Ofgem will announce the official new energy price cap level on 25 February, which will affect homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "The predicted rise will come as the days get lighter and warmer, when energy use tends to fall.",
      "Cornwall say the hike is due to a combination of colder weather and a fall in gas storage levels across Europe, which has led to a sharp rise in wholesale prices.",
      "Bills are about 50% higher than pre-Covid levels, but remain below the peak reached in 2022 when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused energy prices to spike.",

      "Rising bills",
      "The price cap affects 26 million households on default, variable tariffs and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so household bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "The regulator illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "In January, there was a 1.2% rise - which worked out as \u00a31.75 extra a month compared with the previous cap.",
      "A period of high prices means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.8bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "A rise in the energy cap would mean a third successive increase in energy bills at a time of year when the weather starts to get warmer and households would usually hope to see a reprieve in costs.",
      "National Energy Action (NEA), a charity aimed at helping people struggling with energy bills, said it will feel like an \"interminable winter\" for many.",
      "\"There is no getting used to this new normal for the people we try to help,\" said NEA's chief executive Adam Scorer.",

      "He suggested setting up a national retrofit advice service to \"enable people to feel confident to install measures, such as insulation and draught proofing\".",
      "In his letter to the regulator, Miliband asked the Ofgem chief executive to set out faster means it can pursue to ease the pressure of the \"rollercoaster\" of global gas markets.",

    "summary": "As Drake drops a new album after his Not Like Us diss track humiliation - what's his strategy?",
    "story": [
      "\"Gimme a hug, Gimme a hug!,\" pleads Drake on one track from his new album, $ome $exy $ongs 4 U.",
      "After the month and year he's had, perhaps it's no surprise.",
      "As rap battle humiliations go, the rapper's defeat by hip-hop's lyrical supremo Kendrick Lamar has become a cultural phenomenon, and even seen Drake sue Universal Music Group.",
      "Lamar's diss track, Not Like Us, a viral hit since last summer, accuses the Canadian star of inappropriate relationships with underage girls - claims Drake denies.",
      "First the track swept up at the Grammys, with Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 dancing along. Then came Lamar's Super Bowl half-time show, with a record 133.5 million people estimated to have tuned in to watch the whole stadium sing the lyrics accusing Drake of being a paedophile.",
      "And on Friday the single finally topped the UK charts nine months after release, matching its stateside success.",
      "But rather than lay low, Drake, the dominant chart-topper of the past 15 years, is coming out fighting with an \"intriguing\" strategy after being put in a \"cultural chokehold\", says crisis PR expert Mark Borkowski.",
      "As Lamar grins through the bright lights of his victory lap, Drake's chosen to sidestep the beef - bar one embittered freestyle denouncing fake friends - and instead focused on repositioning himself.",
      "Currently on tour in Australia, he's been loosening up, gently leaning into the softer image he's spent recent years trying to toughen, even performing an intimate karaoke bar set of early sultry hits.",
      "Then on Valentine's Day, almost a week after the Super Bowl, he returned with $ome $exy $ongs 4 U, a full-length collaboration with PartyNextDoor that harks back to his R&B-tinged rise.",
      "Full of trap-soul beats teasing romantic escapades, Borkowski calls it a \"calculated retreat into the familiar, comfortable territory\" of the more sensitive \"certified lover boy\" persona that dominated Drake's initial breakthrough albums like Thank Me Later and 2011's Take Care.",
      "In the 2010s, Drake was the most-listened to Spotify artist, racking up more than 28 billion streams, with his most popular song, One Dance, played 1.7 billion times alone.",
      "Even if Not Like Us saw the crown slip, he remained the fourth most-streamed artist on the platform last year.",
      "\"His reputation might be in tatters within certain circles, but commercially, he remains bulletproof,\" says Borkowski.",
      "Commercial chameleon",
      "It helps that Drake harnessed mass appeal by sampling a myriad of genres in his pomp of pop-rap dominance.",
      "His catalogue -  boasting 45 UK top 10 singles, (including six number ones), and over 300 hits in the US Hot 100 - inhaled fumes of grime, dancehall and afrobeat.",
      "The camouflage from his status as a commercial chameleon means that \"despite the clear L and Not Like Us becoming a defining moment in rap history, Drake keeps moving\", says Borkowski.",
      "On $ome $exy $ongs 4 U's track Gimme A Hug, Drake seems to wave the white flag in his Kendrick battle saying:  \"[Expletive] a rap beef, I'm tryna get the party lit.\"",
      "It's worked, too, at least commercially. According to Billboard, Apple Music confirmed $ome $exy $ongs 4 U's release broke first-day R&B streaming records on the platform.",
      "In Friday's official UK charts, the album came in at number three.",
      "Three of its songs also made up the top 40 - including Gimme A Hug.",
      "Critical reception, meanwhile, has been mixed. Vulture described it as \"yearning pre-beef star finding his footing\", with a sound \"conscientiously re-establishing\" his earlier aesthetic.",
      "Rolling Stone's Jeff Ihaza, in a three-and-a-half-star review, spoke of a \"return to form from an artist whose back was truly against the wall\".",
      "Pitchfork's Alphonse Pierre, however, was scathing, lambasting \"a desperate album from one of rap's most notorious narcissists\".",
      "Regardless, Borkowski is clear on the strategy - Gimme A Hug, like the album, isn't a response track, it's an abdication from the fight. A recognition that Drake can still win, just on a different rap turf.",
      "Nostalgia trip",
      "So, where is Drake headed if he's conceding the rap battlefield? The answer is the nostalgia play.",
      "Weeks before the release of this new album, Drake opened his Australian tour by coming out on stage in a vest with smoking bullet holes. He closed the show by declaring: \"My name is Drake, I started in 2008, I came all the way from Toronto, Canada. The year is now 2025, and\u00a0Drizzy Drake is very much still alive.\"",
      "For music and culture journalist Manu Ekanayake, the new album revisiting his early 2010s era, when he \"sounded confident in what he was trying to do\", mirrors this.",
      "But, he warns, \"after three recent albums of being the least convincing tough guy in town, can he really go back to being the singing party boy?\".",
      "He's certainly going to try. Days after the album drop, Drake announced an unprecedented three-night takeover of London's Wireless Festival this summer, with each night's set focusing on a different part of his career.",
      "Organisers confirmed the dates sold out in record time. For Borkowski, this is a \"masterclass in reframing\".",
      "\"Drake is curating his own legacy, reminding people of his longevity, and shifting the conversation away from defeat and back to dominance.\"",
      "Ekanayake is less sure of the long-term potential: \"Now at 38, it all sounds very different from when he was in the first flush of success in his 20s.",
      "\"What seemed before like a young artist giving hip-hop a new approach for a new generation, now sounds like it's the end of something.\"",
      "But, ultimately, Borkowski goes back to the bottom line. \"His fans aren't music purists, they're Drake fans - here for the lifestyle, the vibes, and the brand. And as long as he delivers that, nothing truly sticks.\"",
      "The true power move? Securing Live Nation for his rebrand, says Borkowski.",
      "\"It's about staying relevant, ensuring the hits don't stop and keeping the machine running. In today's music industry, perception is currency, and despite the setbacks, Drake is still cashing in.\"",
      "Good thing too, as Lamar's Not Like Us shows no signs of slowing down on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The Compton star's already made US history by becoming the first rapper to have three albums in the Billboard top 10 - with his latest release GNX also number one.",
      "The battle may be over, but the chart war has just begun."

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 15:37:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Daniel Craig's replacement will be Amazon's biggest decision after gaining control of the franchise.",
    "story": [
      "\"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\"",
      "That was the question posed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos this week to his 6.8 million followers on X.",
      "It is Bezos who will now have the final say on the next 007. He asked for suggestions alongside a screenshot of the BBC News story about his company gaining creative control of the famous spy film franchise.",
      "The choice of Daniel Craig's replacement will now be Amazon MGM Studios' biggest decision.",
      "So let's take a look at what direction the company could take, and who is in the frame.",
      "If the replies to Bezos's call out are anything to go by, Henry Cavill is the (online) people's choice.",
      "The former Superman actor, who has said he \"would love to play Bond\", was widely regarded to have been the runner-up years ago when Craig landed the part for the first of his five 007 films, 2006's Casino Royale.",
      "The movie's director Martin Campbell told the Express last year that Cavill's audition was \"tremendous\" and that \"if Daniel didn't exist, Henry would have made an excellent Bond\".",
      "There was just one problem. \"He just looked a little young at that time back then,\" added Campbell.",
      "Longstanding Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who announced on Thursday they were stepping down, have previously shot down the idea of a younger Bond.",
      "\"Remember, Bond's already a veteran,\" Wilson said in 2022. \"He's had some experience. He's a person who has been through the wars, so to speak. He's probably been in the SAS or something.\"",
      "Amazon may have different ideas - but at 41, Cavill could ironically now be considered too old, especially if he stays for a string of subsequent movies.",
      "The next most frequently mentioned names in the replies to Bezos were Tom Hardy, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Idris Elba.",
      "Taylor-Johnson, 34, known for roles in Kick-Ass and Kraven the Hunter, was at one stage rumoured to have been offered the job, but no announcement ever materialised.",
      "Kraven bombed at the box office last year, though, which could count against him.",
      "The bookmakers had Happy Valley actor James Norton listed as their favourite on Friday.",
      "Speaking on the red carpet at last weekend's Bafta Awards, Norton, 39, described the speculation around him becoming Bond as \"so weird and bemusing\" yet \"fun\".",
      "'Bring it younger'",
      "Mark O'Connell, author of Catching Bullets: Memoirs of a Bond Fan, told the BBC he thinks Amazon - and whoever they choose as the next director - will go for a younger actor than in previous times, and he hopes they buy British again.",
      "\"Tom Hardy would be great, [but] I think he's, dare I say, too old,\" he said of the 47-year-old Mad Max actor.",
      "\"There's a lot of guys that keep getting quoted [and] I'm like, they're too old.",
      "\"I think Amazon's going to bring it younger. I think we're looking at early 30s. Paul Mescal is a good name. Kingsley Ben-Adir, who's one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, I'd keep an eye on him - he's got a sort of [Sean] Connery swagger about him.",
      "\"Harris Dickinson, who's a British actor doing well in Babygirl with Nicole Kidman at the moment, he's very British,\" O'Connell added.",
      "\"I hope they stick with the British DNA and origins of the role. I think they would be foolish to move away from that. But time will tell.\"",
      "Bond has been played by two non-British actors in the past - Australian George Lazenby and Irishman Pierce Brosnan. So don't rule out the likes of fellow Irish stars Mescal, Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, Aidan Turner, or Aussie Jacob Elordi.",
      "Could Amazon break the mould and go for the first American Bond? If so, Austin Butler has been mooted.",
      "Other Brits who have been shaken but not stirred into the mix include Challengers star Josh O'Connor, 34, and Babylon's Stuart Martin, 39, as well as White Lotus actor Theo James, who is 40.",
      "Callum Turner, Richard Madden, Will Poulter and Nicholas Hoult have also been suggested, among others.",
      "'Teasing Bond's masculine ego'",
      "Since Bond - originally the creation of author Ian Fleming - hit the big screen in 1962, first played by Scotsman Sean Connery, his hair and eye colour have changed, not to mention his accent.",
      "But so far, the character's skin colour and gender have remained fixed.",
      "That is apart from when Lashana Lynch briefly took over the 007 title from Craig's Bond in No Time to Die.",
      "\"James Bond can be of any colour, but he is male,\" Broccoli said in 2020.",
      "\"I'm not particularly interested in taking a male character and having a woman play it. I think women are far more interesting than that.\"",
      "She added: \"He should be British, so British can be any [ethnicity].\"",
      "Bridgerton actor Rege-Jean Page has been mooted alongside Ben-Adir as a possible first non-white Bond, as have Lucien Laviscount, Paapa Essiedu, Damson Idris, Riz Ahmed and Aaron Pierre.",
      "If Bezos does break Broccoli's rule and go for a woman, Cynthia Erivo would be a popular choice.",
      "However, Idris Elba, 52, the star of The Wire and Luther, said in 2023 that the racist backlash to the prospect of him being Bond \"made the whole thing disgusting and off-putting\".",
      "It's not just the lead role that the Amazon casting department will have to think about.",
      "\"In terms of what they could do with the women, I would love to see more interesting and nuanced female characters,\" said Monica German\u00e0, author of Bond Girls: Body, Fashion and Gender.",
      "\"There is a growing female fandom, so we want more interesting female characters teasing Bond's masculine ego.\"",
      "Then there are the villains, who are the characters with their \"pulse on the real world\", German\u00e0 said.",
      "\"They represent the anxieties we have about the world. So it'd be interesting what Amazon does with that. Will the next villain be, I don't know, will it be AI? Will it be something to do with climate change? Will it be far-right politics that they tap into?\"",
      "'Rediscover the fun'",
      "Debating the next James Bond is \"a national and international obsession\", BBC Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"I want to have an answer for you. I want to say names like Harris Dickinson or Leo Woodall and say, yes, it's going to be them. But it's all up in the air.\"",
      "Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine and podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live that while he \"admired what Craig has achieved\", he wants the new management \"to rediscover the fun of Bond\".",
      "Bond fan and author Ajay Chowdhury added: \"I think Bond ultimately is fantasy and it's fun and I think that entertainment value could be brought back.\"",
      "Bond bosses have often alternated between serious and lighter-hearted lead actors, he said.",
      "\"They always tend to reboot. You have a serious Bond [like Timothy] Dalton followed by a lighter Bond, Brosnan. Serious, Craig - and I think it's time to do that again.\"",
      "Chowdhury thinks the new Bond will be \"an established British actor\" with what he calls \"the Goldilocks amount of fame\" - not too hot, not too cold.",
      "\"They'll have done TV and theatre across the Atlantic, but they won't be stars,\" he offers.",
      "\"They'll have just the right amount of fame and they'll be young enough to do three or four [films].",

      "\"Like a lot of kids in the 70s, I was in a band,\" he says.",
      "\"As long as you were committed to the idea, it was quite easy to do. You borrowed instruments, you borrowed an amp, recorded yourself live and took a cassette round local pubs to persuade them to listen, and give you a gig.",
      "\"Glasgow was a great city to be in, full of places to play and there were so many great bands around. I remember seeing Simple Minds but we were never that successful and we all went our separate ways.\"",
      "Music was always a passion but it was acting which took precedence as Capaldi moved to London and appeared in a string of films including Local Hero, The Lair of the White Worm, Dangerous Liaisons, and television shows such as The Thick of It and Dr Who, where he famously launched into a guitar solo in his first episode as the Time Lord.",
      "\"I was never a great player, I didn't spend all that time writing and I wasn't the guy who brought a guitar to a party and got everyone to sing songs but I was always keen on it,\" he says.",

      "The album cover for Sweet Illusions - from which the first single, Bin Night, was released last year - features Peter at a bus stop in London, thinking about home.",
      "\"I've come back to music again after 40 years, so it seems apt that it's in Glasgow.\"",
      "\"I'm not doing this to become a pop star. I'm not hoping to change my career. It's just something that I really enjoy. I take it seriously in the sense that I work at it and try and develop it as a craft but I don't expect to be at the Emmys, or to be in the charts.\"",
      "He may not have any say in that. Sweet Illusions is due for release on 28 March and with the first run of 1,200 albums already earmarked, it's likely to score highly in both the UK vinyl and Scottish charts. The Tranent pressing plant is on standby for another order.",

It was like coming home.",

      "Christina Fulton accuses her 34-year-old son, Weston Cage, whom she described as a \"300-pound professional fighter\", of attacking her without provocation.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Fulton, 57, is suing her son for assault and battery and Cage, 61, for negligence, claiming he failed to prevent their son's alleged behaviour.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the \"catastrophic physical, emotional, and economic harm she has endured due to an unprovoked attack by their son, Weston\". Nicolas Cage's lawyers called the lawsuit \"frivolous\".",
      "Weston Cage was arrested in June last year and charged with two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon following accusations that he attacked his mother and another individual.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both charges.",
      "Ms Fulton claims she visited her son on 28 April 2024 after receiving \"urgent messages\" from his friends, according to the civil complaint submitted to the Los Angeles County Superior Court.",
      "Upon arriving, she alleges he attacked her in a \"manic rage\", assaulting her in the car park, lift and lobby of his residence. The lawsuit says she was left with a concussion, multiple contusions, neck and throat injuries, dental trauma, tinnitus, abdominal trauma and PTSD.",
      "Ms Fulton alleges that Nicolas Cage was aware of their son's \"long history of mental and psychological disorder\" and previous alleged acts of \"violent assault and battery\", but continued to enable such behaviour by providing financial support.",
      "The lawsuit adds that Mr Cage bought an apartment for their son next door to his own residence, bailed him out of jail multiple times, and drank alcohol with him despite knowing about his alleged struggles with substance abuse.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Nicolas Cage's lawyer, Brian Wolf, said the lawsuit was \"absurd\".",
      "\"Weston Coppola is a 34 year old man,\" Mr Wolf said. \"Mr Cage does not control Weston's behavior in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother.\"",
      "Weston Cage's lawyer, Michael A Goldstein, said Ms Fulton's decision to file a lawsuit against her own son was not surprising, given what he described as her past history of litigation against family members.",
      "\"It appears to be nothing short of a money grab and call for attention,\" said Mr Goldstein. Ms Fulton correctly advised the responding LAPD officers that her son was in the midst of a mental health crisis at the time of the incident, he added.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, Joseph Farzam, the attorney representing Ms Fulton, agreed that most people are not responsible for their adult children's actions.",
      "But he said the law was very clear that a parent can be responsible for an adult child with any mental disability if they cannot support themselves.",
      "\"This is a unique situation,\" he told the BBC. \"Weston has a history of violence and his father has not stopped him, but enabled him, bailed him and made the situation much worse.\"",
      "Ms Fulton, who was in a relationship with Nicolas Cage from 1988-91, previously sued the actor in 2009 over a financial dispute.",
      "She alleged he owed her $13m (\u00a310m) and had reneged on a promise to buy her a home in Hancock Park, a wealthy LA enclave. That case was settled in 2011 under undisclosed terms.",
      "This is not the first bout of legal trouble for Weston Cage.",
      "In 2011, he and his then-wife, Nikki Williams, were arrested on felony domestic violence charges.",
      "In 2017, he was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence and hit-and-run. He pleaded no contest, was given three years of probation and had to go to a recovery programme and complete community service."

    "summary": "Long-serving masterminds Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson give creative control to Amazon.",
    "story": [
      "The closing credits of 2021's No Time To Die, the most recent film in the 007 series, ended with a familiar message: \"James Bond will return.\"",
      "But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure.",
      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",
      "That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.",
      "\"It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,\" Bond says.",
      "In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.",
      "A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK.",
      "\"I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,\" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",
      "That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.",
      "Strong added: \"When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.\"",
      "The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role.",
      "Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.",
      "How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.",
      "\"It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,\" he says. \"Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.\"",

      "It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars.",
      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",

      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",
      "\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.",
      "Kemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.",
      "If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.",
      "As part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.",
      "From Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

    "story": [
      "An experimental trial of gene therapy has helped four toddlers - born with one of the most severe forms of childhood blindness - gain \"life-changing improvements\" to their sight, according to doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.",
      "The rare genetic condition means the babies' vision deteriorated very rapidly from birth.",
      "Before the therapy, they were registered legally blind and only just able to distinguish between dark and light. After the infusion, all parents reported improvements - with some of their young children now able to begin to draw and write.",
      "Further work is being done to confirm the early study, which appears in the Lancet medical journal.",
      "Gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness has been available on the NHS since 2020.",
      "The new work builds on that success by injecting healthy copies of a defective gene into the back of a child's eye, very early in life, to treat a severe form of the condition.",
      "Jace, from Connecticut in the United States, had the gene therapy in London when he was just two years old.",
      "As a young baby, his parents noticed something wasn't right about his eyesight.",
      "\"Around eight weeks old when babies should start looking at you and smiling, Jace wasn't doing that yet,\" says his mum DJ.",
      "She knew instinctively there was an issue and began to search for the reason, which took 10 months.",
      "After several visits to doctors and many tests, the family were told Jace had the ultra rare condition. It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.",
      "\"It was a shock,\" Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child.",
      "\"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward.\"",
      "The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.",
      "Jace's surgery was quick and \"pretty easy\", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.",
      "These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.",
      "In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.",
      "His son's progress has been \"pretty amazing\", he says.",
      "\"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.",
      "\"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before.\"",
      "This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.",
      "\"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision,\" Brendan says.",
      "No other options",
      "Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people.",
      "\"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development.",
      "\"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected,\" he said.",
      "The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.",
      "Scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye, and Great Ormond Street Hospital specialists led on giving the procedure in the trial.",
      "Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available.",
      "Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects.",
      "They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors.",
      "Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging.",
      "'Hugely impressive'",
      "According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give \"compelling evidence\" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.",
      "Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected.",
      "Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: \"The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives.\"",
      "The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.",
      "The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the \"greatest benefit\" and ultimately transform children's lives.",

      "Oban is home to just 8,000 people and at least eight recent confirmed or suspected victims of drug misuse were buried here. The youngest was 26, the oldest was 48.",
      "The population of the town is about the same as the total number of overdose deaths recorded in Scotland in the past seven years - by far the worst rate in Europe.",
      "The deaths have led to calls for urgent action to tackle addiction in rural Scotland with relatives citing problems accessing vital services.",
      "Scotland's Health Secretary Neil Gray has told BBC News that he accepts more needs to be done to tackle drug misuse in rural areas.",
      "For James' mother, Jayne Donn, the nightmare began before dawn on a freezing night in December 2022 when she was woken by the doorbell.",
      "\"At 10 to five in the morning, when it was snowing and my Christmas tree was up, the police came to my door,\" she says.",
      "The officers had come, as Jayne had long dreaded they would, to tell her that her 29-year-old son was dead of an overdose.",
      "James was another victim of a crisis that has been raging across Scotland for almost a decade, claiming 1,172 lives in 2023.",
      "\"As a little boy he was blonde-haired, blue-eyed, full of mischief,\" Jayne tells me in the living room of the family home.",
      "The young James loved \"fishing, music and his skateboard,\" she says.",
      "\"As a man, there's not so many good memories,\" says Jayne.",
      "\"He was very mixed up. He was very angry. He was very lost.\"",
      "James' father left the family home when he was seven.",
      "He struggled at school with dyslexia and mental health challenges and later began to dabble with cannabis.",
      "He started to get into trouble, first with teachers, then with the police.",
      "As he grew into adulthood, James drifted away from Oban and from his family, losing a job as an apprentice bricklayer because of poor attendance and concentration, and disappearing to England.",
      "Jayne says she knew little about what was happening there. In truth, her son's life was unravelling.",
      "He had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and drug-induced psychosis.",
      "He was struggling with suicidal tendencies, taking more and harder drugs and increasingly turning to crime.",
      "As a result he was in and out of custody for drug offences, breach of the peace, break-ins and theft, at one point serving a two-year prison sentence.",
      "James died in Glasgow on 16 December 2022 - less than two days after he was released from custody following eight months on remand in Barlinnie prison.",
      "James' mother says she doesn't know the details of the last charges he had faced or why he was released - but she believes more could have been done to support her son, as he had overdosed on release from custody on three previous occasions.",
      "A Scottish Prison Service source pointed out that decisions taken at the end of a period of remand are a matter for the courts not the prison.",

      "\"She ended up buying it off the streets because she felt she needed more,\" Tanya remembers.",
      "\"She kept on saying that she needed more help, more support.\"",
      "Then, she says, her sister started taking heroin.",
      "Lisa had a cardiac arrest on 13 September 2022 and died four days later in hospital in Paisley. She was 42 years old.",
      "She had prescription drugs in her system and also Etizolam, a benzodiazepine-type substance commonly known as street Valium because it is often sold illicitly.",
      "Tanya and Jayne take us to the spot where they both mourn, pointing out other nearby graves where recent drug death victims are buried.",
      "They include James's best friend, who lies alongside him and Lisa. He was 30 when he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It's just awful to think there's at least 10 around here that we can think of,\" says Jayne.",
      "There is no official breakdown of how many lives have been claimed by drugs in small communities such as Oban.",
      "We have been able to confirm that at least eight of the deaths occurred within just a year-and-a-half and were related to drugs, or are still under investigation.",
      "This is the reality of Scotland's drug deaths crisis in just one small community and both Tanya and Jayne say the Scottish government must do more to save lives.",
      "\"I personally believe that a lot of addiction is to do with mental health first,\" says Tanya.",
      "\"There's no continuity in support from addiction services or mental health services. There's no link up.\"",
      "Jayne, who is a drugs support worker herself, says she spent years trying to bring James home to Oban where she felt he would have a better chance of recovery and survival.",
      "A particular challenge, she says, was that Argyll and Bute Council offered James housing places in Dunoon and Helensburgh \u2013 both about two hours away \u2013 making it very difficult for his family to support him.",
      "The local authority said it had offered \"appropriate\" services to James.",
      "The council added that it had housing services throughout the area, but could not always satisfy \"individual and sometimes changing criteria\".",
      "Scotland's Health Secretary Neil Gray says that both families have his deepest sympathies and he accepts that rural drug services could be improved.",

      "For Justina Murray, chief executive of the charity Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs, the problems do not lie with strategy or funding but with culture and delivery, especially in NHS addiction services.",
      "\"People want services that are in their own community, they can access when they need them, they're going to be met at the door by a friendly face,\" she says.",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the NHS was \"on the road to recovery\" and there were now around 160,000 fewer patients on waiting lists than when Labour took office in July last year.",
      "NHS England figures showed last week that the number of people on the waiting list dropped for the fourth consecutive month to its lowest since April 2023.",
      "An estimated 6.24 million patients were waiting for 7.46 million treatments to be carried out at the end of December in England - down from 6.28 million patients needing 7.48 million treatments in November.",
      "However, the latest figures show 73% of A&E patients were treated or assessed within four hours in England in January - well short of the 95% target and a key benchmark of A&E performance.",
      "And the numbers of A&E patients enduring long waits went up in January, with nearly 160,000 waiting longer than four hours for a bed to be found after a decision to admit them \u2013 many on chairs or trolleys.",

      "It includes a poll of more than 1,600 people who had used the health service in the previous 12 months.",
      "One in five of those surveyed said they received a letter for an appointment after the date it was supposed to take place.",
      "However, nearly a quarter said they did not know who to contact while waiting for care.",
      "Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Helen Morgan said: \"Until the government gets a grip of social care, hospitals will remain overwhelmed, backlogged and it is the patients who will pay the price.\"",
      "She added: \"Too many people have been tragically let down and left waiting in limbo.\"",
      "Streeting has previously defended the government's timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028."

      "Her son Matthew, now 23, was born with a range of conditions, including autism, ADHD, epilepsy and several learning disabilities.",
      "At the age of 18 months, he was diagnosed with foetal valproate syndrome, indicating the medication his mother took was the cause of his problems. Mrs Cox has been campaigning for compensation ever since.",

    "summary": "New legislation being introduced to Parliament next week seeks to criminalise the practices.",
    "story": [
      "Child criminal exploitation and \"cuckooing\" are set to become specific criminal offences as part of new legislation being introduced to Parliament next week.",
      "The Crime and Policing Bill will also include measures that could see restriction orders put on people thought to be at risk of exploiting children for criminal means.",
      "Cuckooing is when the home of a vulnerable person is taken over by criminals who use it as a base for illegal activities, such as drug dealing.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said exploitation like this was \"sickening\", adding that legislation would ensure victims were \"properly protected and prevent these often hidden crimes from occurring in the first place\".",
      "\"It is vital we do everything in our power to eradicate it from our streets,\" she said.",
      "Under current CPS guidelines, prosecutors dealing with a suspected case of cuckooing may look to other offences such as assault, harassment and modern day slavery in order to bring charges - but these might not cover all examples.",
      "The previous Conservative government had announced plans to criminalise cuckooing in its Criminal Justice Bill last year, but this legislation made no further progress when Parliament was dissolved for the snap general election.",
      "Gennine Bird, a former heroin and cocaine user, told the BBC last year that cuckooing can involve a lot of intimidation by drug dealers, and that they will give drugs to the vulnerable person in order to stay in the property.",
      "\"A lot of people get beaten up, people get raped, women get sent out to do prostitution to pay off debts because, you know, they'll say give you the drugs, give you the drugs and then 'oh, you owe me money, you've got to pay that, and you don't have any money'. So they like, go out and sell your body,\" she said.",
      "Dr Laura Bainbridge, an associate professor of criminal justice at Leeds University who specialises in cuckooing, welcomed the legislation saying the criminal and civil orders currently used to charge cuckooers are not consistent across England and Wales, and the harm caused to individuals is not reflected in sentences.",
      "But she told the Today programme that there were some grey areas and that determining victims and perpetrators in a cuckooing situation can be \"very difficult to untangle\" and \"no two instances of cuckooing are identical.",
      "\"It may be the case that a vulnerable victim truly believes that say the drug dealer  is their friend and refuses to eject them from their property - thus moving them towards the offender domain - or it may be the case that the perpetrator has been forced to cuckoo a property, by say county lines gang to pay off the drugs debt, and this moves them towards the victim domain,\" she said.",
      "She added that she hopes the new law will ensure that victims are protected and not prosecuted, and that a multi-agency rather than an enforcement approach will be used.",
      "The child criminal exploitation (CCE) offence in Labour's bill is designed to target people who groom children into criminal activity, including county lines drug dealing or organised robbery, the Home Office says.",
      "Around 14,500 children were identified as being at risk of CCE in 2023-24, though the government says that is likely to be an underestimated figure.",
      "The cuckooing offence will carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison, while the standalone child criminal exploitation offence will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.",
      "The legislation will also see the introduction of CCE prevention orders, which will mean that courts can put restrictions on people who they believe pose a risk of exploiting a child for criminal purposes.",
      "Breaking these orders will also be a criminal offence, carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the UK's Children's Commissioner, has said the measures will provide \"clarity that exploited children are victims\".",
      "\"Many children targeted by adult criminals themselves face punishment instead of support,\" she said.",
      "\"Like too many child victims, they are often ignored and overlooked. Their voices and experiences must be listened to, if we are to create a child-centric justice system that puts safeguarding at its heart.\"",

      "Nineteen councils can sell assets to cover services",
      "How much is council tax going up?",
      "Councils in England will have \u00a369.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year.",
      "But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years.",
      "On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective \u00a31.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic.",
      "Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions.",
      "They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year.",
      "Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton.",
      "Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022.",
      "'Short-term measure'",
      "The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs.",
      "Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online.",
      "They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment.",
      "The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in \"partnership - not punishment\".",
      "The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending.",
      "Funding changes",
      "London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a \"short-term measure\" that \"leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about\".",
      "The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing.",
      "Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing.",
      "They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally.",
      "They have promised the new formula will take into account the \"impact of rurality\" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Conservative-run councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being unfairly funded."

    "summary": "When Sir Keir Starmer touches down in Washington next week, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line.",
    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday, he will be treading a fine diplomatic line.",
      "He will want to maintain his support for President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine's government. But he will also want to gain the ear of President Donald Trump over the talks he has begun with Russia to end the war.",
      "All this while keeping out of the venomous verbal crossfire between Washington and Kyiv.",
      "That will be no easy task.",
      "Transatlantic relations are in pieces. The US president has upended America's longstanding support for Ukraine and sidelined Europe in the process.",
      "US defence secretary Pete Hegseth says European security is no longer a US priority. Vice-President JD Vance attacks the very nature of European democracy.",
      "It is into this cauldron of ideological enmity that Sir Keir will seek a hearing when he meets the president and his team at the White House.",
      "So what can and should the prime minister do?",
      "Diplomats say he has one advantage over European allies, namely his permanence. Trump, they say, knows Sir Keir is one of the few European leaders who will stay in power throughout his presidency. Trump, it is said, likes the fact the prime minister has a healthy parliamentary majority.",
      "\"I get along with him well,\" Trump told the BBC a few weeks ago. \"I like him a lot. He's liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he's a very good person and I think he's done a very good job thus far.\"",
      "But warm words and familiarity do not pay for lunch inside the Washington beltway.",
      "What could Sir Keir offer the famously transactional president? He has already made a downpayment by offering to deploy British boots on the ground in Ukraine as part of a post-war reassurance force.",
      "This angered some European leaders who thought it premature and divisive. It also risked Europe getting excluded from discussions about more fundamental issues such as Ukraine's territory and sovereignty. But the troops offer may gain Sir Keir some diplomatic brownie points in the West Wing.",
      "The other thing Sir Keir could offer Trump is the strongest possible language he can muster promising to increase UK defence spending. Starmer is not expected to announce when he will meet his target of spending 2.5% of national income on defence. But he may talk up both the UK's commitment and his calls for other European allies to do likewise.",
      "Sir Alex Younger, former chief of MI6, told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"We need to demonstrate that we are prepared to play a role, take control of our own environment, recognise that we have got to develop our power and that has got to happen quickly.\"",
      "But diplomats say the main argument Starmer must make is to convince Trump that a fast deal on Russian terms would be against his own interests. Namely that the terms of any ceasefire - its fairness, its permanence, its safeguards - were as important as any short term cessation of hostilities. In other words, that there is no point in having a triumphant ceasefire agreement which does not survive for long, risking Trump's reputation.",
      "\"If I were Starmer, I would say to Trump that this is your chance for your place in history, the man who brought peace and ended this war,\" Lord Darroch, the former UK ambassador to the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But it has to be a fair deal. If it's a bad deal, you are not going to get that praise, you are going to get a load of criticism and that will be your record in the history books.\"",
      "Key to that would be urging Trump to put pressure on Vladmir Putin by threatening to seize frozen Russian assets, increase support for Ukraine and tighten up sanctions.",
      "Huge risks",
      "But the risks of the prime minister's trip are huge. The famously thin-skinned president could take offence at Sir Keir's outright contradiction of his claim that Zelensky is a dictator. He could be irritated by Sir Keir's insistence that any European reassurance force deployed to Ukraine must have a US \"backstop\", expected in the form of aircover.",
      "The diplomatic pitfalls of cross words and cancelled press conferences will be troubling the minds of British officials as they prepare for the trip. They will be acutely aware President Emmanuel Macron of France will be in Washington before them on Monday, competing for Mr Trump's ear.",
      "Sir Keir likes to say that in these troubled times, the UK can once again become a bridge between Europe and the US. France may be keen for that role too.",
      "Another potential point of tension will be trade. Team Trump is promising to impose tariffs on UK goods entering the US that match VAT levied on American goods entering the UK. One argument the UK could make is that hitting British and European trade will make it harder for them to spend more on defence. But officials say that would be a hard argument to make to a president who thinks Europe is ripping off the US both economically and militarily.",
      "The greatest risk, however, is that no manner of charm, politics or diplomacy may touch the sides of this new administration, that there is simply no transactional offer that can bridge the vast ideological divide that now exists between Europe and the US. That may be the cold hard lesson the British delegation learns in Washington.",
      "\"We are living in a US presidency which is based on great power diplomacy,\" one official said. \"If we can work within that, fine. If not, God help us.\"",

    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",

    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",

      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Dr Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed and has \"flushed\" weak sand out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Dr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added unrecorded underground sand mines may be present in the area, and it is possible that a leaking pipe may have triggered the collapse of these underground mines and allowed sediment to be flushed out from beneath the road.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Dr Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

      "Barely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.",
      "And now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.",
      "In response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.",
      "'If US is not doing it, why should we?'",
      "\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.",

      "\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.",
      "\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\"",
      "Nithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.",

      "At the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".",

      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",
      "\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.",
      "\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"",
      "Global energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels."

      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",

      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",

      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",

      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",

Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",

      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",

      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",
      "The regulator accused the apps of \"a lack of robust interventions\" for checking the ages of their users.",
      "The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",

      "In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -  took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a TikTok spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",
      "A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies.",
      "'84% use social media'",
      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",

      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",

      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",

      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",

      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",

      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",

    "story": [
      "After a series of high-profile disasters, some social media users suggested that air travel accidents were becoming more frequent.",
      "Videos of hair-raising near misses began to trend online and the US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy sought to calm fears in an interview with the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He told viewers that the recent spate of air disasters in America were \"very unique\".",
      "Duffy's intervention came after several serious incidents, including a mid-air collision in January between a commercial airliner and a military helicopter in Washington DC, in which 67 people died.",
      "Footage of a plane flipping over after landing in poor weather in Toronto, Canada, has also been widely shared online, further fuelling alarm.",
      "And while polling on the subject is limited, one recent Associated Press survey suggested these startling images of accidents have had some impact on some US consumers' confidence in flying.",
      "But BBC Verify has analysed data in the US and worldwide and found that over the past two decades there has been a general downward trend in air accidents.",
      "For the US, figures on air accidents have been compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) up to the end of January this year.",
      "This NTSB data shows a general fall in air accidents in the US from 2005 to 2024 despite a significant increase in the overall number of flights over this period. It also shows that the figure for January 2025 (52), was lower than it was in January last year (58) and January 2023 (70).",
      "Data from International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN body which monitors global air incidents, shows that the number of worldwide accidents per million plane departures has also seen a clear downward trend between 2005 and 2023.",
      "The ICAO definition of an aircraft accident is very broad and not only includes those in which passengers or crew are seriously injured or die, but also incidents where an aircraft is damaged and needs repairs, or goes missing.",
      "Data on the number of deaths in air accidents globally also shows that there has been a decrease over the same period, albeit with spikes in some years reflecting major air disasters.",
      "In 2014, two such events contributed to a significant spike.",
      "In March, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared as it travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. In July, another Malaysian Airlines plane, MH17, was shot down by a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine, killing almost 300.",
      "Data sets such as this are inclined to see sudden, large fluctuations, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge, told BBC Verify.",
      "\"If you count fatalities rather than accidents it's bound to be extremely volatile and sensitive to a single large accident,\" he said.",
      "\"Random events do not occur evenly - they tend to cluster. So unfortunately we can expect aircraft accidents to be appear to be connected, even when they are not.\"",
      "Regarding the series of high-profile accidents over the past few months, Ismo Aaltonen, formerly Finland's chief air disaster investigator, told BBC Verify they are not an indication of a decline in aircraft safety.",
      "\"It's very unlucky that we had this period of many different kind of accidents, but people should not draw any conclusions based on this because they are such different cases,\" he said.",
      "He noted that some incidents over the past few months were unforeseeable, citing an Azerbaijan Airlines flight which crashed in Kazakhstan in December after being targeted by a Russian anti-aircraft missile.",
      "Marco Chan, a former pilot and senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University, told BBC Verify that the rise in awareness of air disasters is being further fuelled because \"accidents are getting increasing exposure from social media platforms\".",
      "One video circulating on TikTok - which has been pulled from a Superman film - shows the hero preventing a jet from smashing into a stadium. Accompanying the clip is the caption: \"Pete Buttigieg every single day the last four years, judging by current events.\" The viral clip suggests that aviation disasters have grown since the ex-US transportation secretary left office in January.",
      "A string of incidents in recent years involving the Boeing 737 Max aircraft has also attracted significant attention in the media and on social media, especially after a door blew out mid-flight in January 2024.",
      "Concerns over that and several other incidents saw some customers boycott planes manufactured by Boeing and a collapse in the company's share price.",
      "Experts told BBC Verify that incidents such as these and major crashes are thoroughly investigated by authorities. New details and data from accidents are fed into pilot training simulators so that they can prepare for similar scenarios in the future.",
      "\"If you look at simulators today, how advanced they are, they are like real aircraft,\" said Ismo Aaltonen. \"It's completely different to when I started flying more than 40 years ago.\"",
      "Regulators can also impose penalties for safety violations which include fines, license suspensions and operational restrictions. Airlines can also be banned from countries and blocs if they don't adhere to safety standards.",
      "Despite the recent spate of incidents, air travel remains by far the safest form of travel.",
      "Of all transport-related deaths in 2022 in the US, over 95% occurred on the road, according to the latest available figures from the US Department of Transportation. Fewer than 1% were related to air travel.",
      "And if you look at the figures in terms of fatalities per distance travelled, the comparative safety of air travel is even clearer.",
      "In 2022, there were just 0.001 passenger deaths per 100,000,000 miles onboard airlines, compared with 0.54 in passenger vehicles, according to the most recent figures from the National Safety Council, a US-based non-profit organisation.",
      "\"Be careful how you make your trip to the airport\" said Mr Aaltonen. \"That's the most dangerous part of the trip compared to the actual flight.\"",

      "She has appealed to younger voters on social media, and is far ahead in the race on TikTok, with 870,000 followers. She has also been buoyed by support from both billionaire Elon Musk and US Vice-President JD Vance, who has been accused of meddling in the German campaign.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 01:16:14 GMT",
    "summary": "What is it like to be an ethnic Tutsi in DR Congo - the people for whom the M23 rebels say they are fighting?",
    "story": [
      "The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region's two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.",
      "Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted.",
      "Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese.",
      "For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians.",
      "Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo's vast mineral wealth.",
      "It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name.",
      "That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province.",
      "This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians.",
      "At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo.",
      "The perception that Congolese Tutsis are \"foreign\" can have deadly consequences.",
      "Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu's Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities.",
      "He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle's son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on this allegation.",
      "Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he \"wished the world knew\" his community was experiencing what he called a \"silent genocide\".",
      "Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu.",
      "\"I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (\u00a3120) to save myself from being imprisoned,\" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23's cause.",
      "Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa.",
      "Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life.",
      "Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority.",
      "Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo.",
      "As DR Congo's Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities \"alternately empowered and the undermined\" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn't Say Its Name.",

      "In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960.",
      "But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were \"derived of their nationality and left stateless\", a UN report noted.",
      "In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996.",
      "It also states that \"many\" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats.",
      "Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community.",
      "But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites \"hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence\", the experts said.",
      "There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 \"in an apparent case of ethnic hatred\".",
      "Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment.",
      "Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns.",
      "He told the BBC he had seen \"pretty terrifying\" social media posts over the past few weeks - \"a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they're Rwandan\".",
      "Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23's current uprising, Mr Stearns says \"many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels\".",
      "The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi said he had \"had enough\" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo.",
      "However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: \"We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community\".",
      "However, Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he \"strongly\" believes his ethnic group are discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she \"looked like a Rwandan spy\".",
      "This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries.",

      "\"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.\"  press conference, Aug 2024",
      "What he's done:",
      "This is perhaps his biggest challenge, given how often inflation topped the list of voters' priorities during the election campaign. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to \"marshal the vast powers\" of his Cabinet to rapidly bring down costs and prices, but it's unclear how. One way, he says, is by increasing drilling to reduce energy costs.",
      "A steep price rise in January, the biggest monthly increase for 16 months, has complicated Trump's task. He blamed Joe Biden, who left office on 20 January, and Democratic spending. \"I had nothing to do with it,\" said Trump.",
      "At other times, however, he has admitted it's hard for US presidents to control prices. But economists warn some of his policies could fuel inflation and polling suggests voters would like to see him doing more.",
      "Mass deportations",
      "What he's said:",
      "\"On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.\" 4 Nov 2024",
      "What he's done:",
      "Immigration has perhaps been Trump's main focus since taking power, with more than a dozen executive orders aimed at overhauling the system. His plan to deport foreign nationals in the country illegally, starting with those convicted of crimes, seems to have widespread public support.",
      "But it is uncertain whether he will meet his promise to deport so many. A few raids have made headlines but the number of people being removed does not seem to be record-breaking, according to the daily figures.",
      "In his first month in office, the US deported 37,660 people - less than the monthly average of 57,000 removals and returns in the last full year of Joe Biden's administration, data obtained by Reuters shows.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told the agency that Biden-era deportation numbers were higher because illegal immigration was higher. Nationwide border encounters decreased 66% in January compared to 2024, according to the White House.",

      "What he's said:",
      "\"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes.\" Time Magazine, Dec 2024",
      "What he's done:",
      "True to his word, hours after taking the presidential oath, Trump issued pardons and commutations that paved the way for the release of more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the US Capitol riot. A police officer who was punched that day told the BBC the pardons were a \"slap in the face\".",
      "Ending Ukraine War",

      "What he's done:",
      "Trump has initiated the first talks between the US and Russia since the start of the war, but Ukraine has vowed to reject any deal hatched without it, and there's been an angry exchange between leaders. President Volodymyr Zelensky fears the US president delivering on his campaign promise to end the war but on Moscow's terms and with no security guarantees. There is also anxiety in European capitals that they are being sidelined, and that Trump may dismantle some of the sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for the invasion.",
      "Ending birthright citizenship",
      "What he's said:",
      "Trump told NBC in December he \"absolutely\" planned to end birthright citizenship on day one: \"If somebody sets a foot of just a foot\u2026 on our land, congratulations. You are now a citizen of the United States of America. Yes, we're going to end that.\"",
      "What he's done:",
      "In one of the first acts of his second presidency, Trump ordered an end to an automatic right to American citizenship currently received by nearly anybody born on US soil. Birthright citizenship is not the norm around the world, and Trump's move targets those who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas.",
      "Opponents say the plan interferes with a right that was established by an amendment to the US Constitution nearly 160 years ago. And the issue could be heading for the Supreme Court \u2013 the highest in America \u2013 after an appeals court ruled against Trump, upholding a legal block on his plan.",

      "What he's said:",

      "What he's done:",
      "Trump announced on 21 January that he would levy blanket tariffs on his neighbours on 1 February, linking them to the flow of drugs and migrants into the US. The president has long seen tariffs, which are a tax on imports, as a way to protect domestic industry and increase revenue. Canada and Mexico said they would enact retaliatory taxes on US imports. But Trump delayed starting the tariffs for one month, after promises by both countries to increase border enforcement. There had also been volatility in the markets and warnings from economic experts that these actions could cause prices to rise.",

    "title": "From Baywatch to toxic waste - LA's iconic beaches unrecognisable after fires",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 01:58:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Under orders from President Trump, the EPA is trying to fast track the clean-up of toxic debris from LA's fires.",
    "story": [
      "With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic \"Baywatch\".",
      "But now the iconic beach is surrounded by the ruins of burned homes and palm trees, its parking lot a sorting ground for hazardous waste from the wildfires. The beach babes have been replaced by Environmental Protection Agency crews in hazmat suits sifting through melted electric car batteries and other hazardous waste before it's trucked away to landfills.",
      "The Palisades and Eaton fires generated a staggering amount of debris, estimated to be 4.5 million tonnes. In comparison, the devastating Maui fires of 2023 generated about 400,000 tonnes, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "Those fires took three months of clean-up by the EPA, which is in charge of removing hazardous waste. But now the agency is hoping to finish their job in LA in just a month - by 25 February - after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the EPA \"expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris\".",
      "The decision to sort through the hazardous waste along the coast has prompted protests and as the clean-up of fire debris moves at unprecedented speeds, many are asking if and when the ocean water will be safe for swimming and surfing.",
      "\"In this very vulnerable place, they're sorting this very hazardous, hazardous stuff,\" said actor and environmentalist Bonnie Wright. \"To me, this feels like 10 steps backwards, because you're literally putting this waste even closer to the beach than it already is in the burn sites.\"",
      "Ms Wright, who played Ginny Weasly in the Harry Potter films, wrote a book on sustainability and devotes most of her time now to environmental causes. While their battle to move sorting sites away from the coast ultimately failed, she said activists were successful in urging the EPA to move burned electric vehicle batteries to the Will Rogers site down the road and away from the sensitive Topanga Creek watershed.",
      "The EPA said the burned vehicle batteries are an especially dangerous challenge but that the agency has the expertise to deal with them. To sift waste, they need a large space with roads big enough for truck traffic - which is why the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the beach, is more attractive than inside the windy, mountainous roads of the Palisades.",
      "When lithium ion batteries are damaged - especially by the high heat and flames of a wildfire - they have the potential for reigniting and exploding days, weeks, or even months after they've been impacted, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's incident commander for the LA fires.",
      "\"We have to treat them like unexploded ordinance, or, as the military calls it UXO,\" he said.",
      "Although some have questioned the speed with which the EPA has moved to clean up the toxic debris, he said there is no time to waste.",
      "\"We have to do this very quickly,\" he said, noting that they started sorting waste even as the fires were still raging.",
      "\"If we are delayed, the risk of impacting the ocean, it goes up again.\"",

      "Trump tours LA fire destruction amid worries about disaster aid",
      "Fighting LA's fires from the sky",
      "Mr Calanog was also in charge of the EPA response to the Maui fires, which may hold clues for how to measure what is safe and reasonable when it comes to testing water and soil samples.",
      "Many are concerned about the impacts of heavy metals and chemicals in the air and water after the fires. In Maui, it's been nearly 18 months since the fires and a small part of the coast around Lahaina is still closed to the public. The Army Corps of Engineers - which removes heavy debris after the EPA removes hazardous waste - just finished their last haul from Lahaina on 20 February.",
      "But most of Maui has remained open to locals and tourists and the Hawaii Department of Health announced eight months after the fires that the coastal waters around Lahaina were safe for ocean recreation.",
      "The scale of the clean-up from the Los Angeles fires, however, is unprecedented and the largest in US history.",
      "LA County closed beaches along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch for weeks following the fires in January. Then torrential rain - while helping douse any smouldering embers - caused mudslides in the burn area and runoff of toxic ash and chemicals into the ocean, prompting further closures.",
      "Now most beaches are reopened but a water advisory remains in effect along the coast from Santa Monica to Malibu until further notice advising \"beach goers may recreate on the sand but continue to be advised to stay away from visible fire debris and to stay out of the ocean water during any posted ocean advisory\".",
      "Only the most dedicated and local surfers could access the beaches in the burn area anyway - there's no parking or stopping for about 9 miles along Pacific Coast Highway, which is clogged with trucks and workers cleaning up debris.",
      "Though some will risk most anything to catch a good wave.",
      "While touring the EPA sorting site, Annelisa Moe said she saw two surfers in the water at a popular surf break on Topanga Beach while she watched workers across the street in full PPE handling burned EV car batteries.",
      "\"The water looked like chocolate milk with like brown foam on it,\" recalled Ms Moe, who is the associate director of Science & Policy, Water Quality at Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to making coastal watersheds healthy.",
      "\"It was one of those days, in between storms, like beautiful, sunny, 75 degree weather type of days,\" she said. \"And so it felt a little bit odd to be there amidst the destruction while we have this perfect beach day.\"",
      "Jenny Newman of the Los Angeles regional water quality control board told an LA County Public Health virtual town hall on 18 February that the initial water quality tests they conducted on 22-27 January \"came back better than we expected.\"  But the water board cautioned that people should follow county advisories to stay out of the water near the burn site.",
      "Dozens of scientists and volunteers from Heal The Bay and a myriad of private and public sector agencies have also been testing water and soil samples to see what levels of forever chemicals and heavy metals are present in the ocean, but toxic analysis can take 4-6 weeks and there's very little data available.",
      "At the Surfrider Foundation, volunteers test the ocean water all year long. But their small lab is testing for fecal bacteria - not arsenic. Now it's too dangerous to expose volunteers in the burn areas, so the staff have partnered with Heal the Bay and the University of Southern California to process their water samples.",
      "\"All our community members are ocean lovers. We have the same questions they have,\" said Eugenia Ermacora of the Surfrider Foundation. \"It's a concern, and everybody is asking, When can we go back? When is it safe? And I wish I had an answer.\"",
      "Chad White, a surfer who grew up in the Palisades and who protested against the EPA sorting site along the Pacific Coast Highway, said there's no way he would surf there now - it would be too painful to look at the coast and be reminded of what has been lost. And there's too much metal and other debris in the surf.",
      "\"It's taken my desire to surf down to zero, not just because of the water quality, but just because of what's happening,\" he said over coffee in Topanga Canyon. He rode his first wave in 1977 at Will Rogers State Beach and taught his son to surf at age four and his wife at age 60.",
      "\"It's earth-shattering to someone like me,\" he said of the destruction along the coast. \"That beach means something to me too, and I'm one person. There are tens of, maybe hundreds or thousands of us that utilize the beach every day.\"",
      "Many of Mr White's friends lost their homes and he said people are traumatised to see what the landscape and coast around them looks like now.",
      "\"Every movie that you see, every film that makes anybody from any other part of the world want to come to California is based on their seeing that Pacific Coast Highway and those beautiful homes in Malibu, across along the beach. They're all gone,\" he said. \"Now it's a toxic waste dump.\"",

      "The moments preceding his death are subject to a criminal investigation.",
      "Paul was cycling home from work. The cycle path is separated from the road by a slightly raised curb.",
      "According to witnesses and CCTV, the driver of the SUV began driving in the bike lane. Prosecutors say the driver ran over Paul's foot. Paul banged his fist on the bonnet.",
      "The motorist reversed at first, but then allegedly drove towards the 27-year-old. An autopsy confirmed \"the marks of the vehicle crossing his body\".",

      "At a hearing attended by news agency AFP, he broke into tears and said \"I'm sorry for what happened. I never meant to run him over.\"",
      "Paris has seen a surge in cycling as part of a broader transformation spearheaded by Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Over the last decade, the city has invested \u20ac400m (\u00a3331m) in cycling infrastructure, creating more than 1,000 kilometres of bike lanes.",
      "According to a recent study, cycling now makes up more than 11% of trips within Paris, compared to just 4% by car. Walking is still the most popular way of getting around - accounting for 53% of journeys, followed by public transport (30%).",
      "But despite the investment, cycling in Paris still feels precarious.",
      "Bike lanes are patchy, lack uniformity and often don't have designated traffic lights. The rules surrounding right of way aren't always clear and are often flouted, making it difficult for cyclists to safely navigate.",
      "Paul Varry's death was extreme, but it resonated and has become a symbol of the daily struggle for space on the streets of Paris.",
      "His mother, Nathalie Tison, remembers her son as a carefree spirit who embraced the freedom of cycling. \"He was a very happy and very bubbly person, he had a lovely sense of humour and was always very gentle with the people around him. It's such an injustice because he didn't deserve at all what happened.\"",
      "She told me she had always been concerned about the dangers of her son riding in Paris, where she detected a sense of entitlement among some drivers.",
      "\"Drivers can be super aggressive - nothing can get in their way,\" she said. \"For some, the car is an extension of their virility and if anyone touches their car\u2026 it's taken as a personal attack.",

      "\"He's a splendid speaker and a profound thinker,\" says Klaus-Peter Willsch, a CDU member of the Bundestag who has known him for more than 30 years.",
      "\"A fighter,\" says Willsch, evidenced by the fact that Merz made three attempts to lead his party.",
      "His first two failures, in 2018 and January 2021, could also be read as a sign of his struggle to woo the grassroots.",

      "It would be more than a decade before he returned to parliament, where he has since sought to rip up Merkel's more centrist doctrine on CDU conservatism.",
      "A marked moment of political severance came at the end of last month, when Friedrich Merz pushed through a non-binding motion on tougher immigration rules, by relying on votes from the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD).",
      "He insisted there had been no direct collaboration with the AfD, but his move led to mass protests and has twice been condemned by none other than Merkel herself.",
      "These are rare public interventions by the woman who ruled Germany for 16 years.",
      "Detractors say it was an unforgivable election gambit that will only benefit the AfD, but supporters insist Merz is, in fact, seeking to lure people cleverly from the far right.",
      "He has risked alienating more moderate parts of the electorate before, voting in the 1990s against a bill that included the criminalisation of marital rape.",
      "He later explained that he considered marital rape to already be a crime, and it was other issues in the bill that he objected to.",

      "The party says it would immediately deport all immigrants who commit a crime, and anyone who arrives here illegally.",
      "That stance was applauded by numerous AfD supporters I spoke to at rallies in the lead-up to Sunday's election - including young women who told me they no longer felt safe on the streets.",
      "It's also worth noting that in May, a German court found that \"at least a significant part of the AfD\" believed that anyone with a migrant heritage was not \"properly German\" - even if they held German citizenship.",

      "His reappearance at Monday's event has sparked a wave of discussion, with experts and analysts wondering what it means for him, China's tech sector and the economy in general.",

      "Is Jack Ma 'rehabilitated'?",

      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

    "story": [
      "As the year 2000 ushered in the new millennium, boy bands and pop stars dominated the music charts, and the International Space Station welcomed its first crew, while back on Earth, reality TV was forever changed by an inaugural group of castaways on the CBS show \"Survivor\" \u2014 all when more than 70% of Americans didn't own a cellphone and only half of U.S. households had a computer.",
      "Phil Salvador, library director for the Video Game History Foundation, reflected on this era of rapid technological growth.",
      "\"If you were playing especially computer games back then, you were probably playing on the family computer,\" Salvador  said.",
      "It was a time when gaming hardware was evolving, and titles like Halo and first-person shooters were on the rise. But one game development company, Maxis, was trying something different: simulation games, designed to replicate real-life activities.",
      "At the helm was legendary game designer Will Wright, who had a personal reason for exploring the genre.",
      "\"Will Wright actually lost his home in the Oakland Hills Fire in 1991, and he had to start rebuilding his life, and that became the inspiration for his idea of Dollhouse,\" Salvador said.",
      "Initially a virtual construction game, Dollhouse failed to draw much interest. But when Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997, EA recognized the quirky potential of the game.",
      "Salvador noted that EA realized that people liked telling stories and interacting with the simulated people more than the game's original objective: to construct homes. It was around this time when EA changed the concept from Dollhouse to The Sims.",
      "The Sims spent nearly a decade in development, ultimately creating a digital space where players could control virtual beings, environments and life choices. When the game debuted in February 2000, it was unlike anything seen before.",
      "\"It is a game where you're helping people do chores around the house and use the toilet and things like that, and it's not the most immediately compelling game idea, but once people started seeing it hands-on, I think they realized there was something special happening there,\" Salvador said.",
      "Despite the competition from PlayStation 2 and Xbox, The Sims quickly became a cultural phenomenon. By 2002, it had become the best-selling PC game in history.",
      "\"It is \u2026 humbling to look back on all of the people that we've impacted,\" said Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, Technology and Central Development. \"Multiple generations of people grew up with The Sims.\"",
      "The franchise has redefined what it means to be a gamer, with women making up around 60% of the most recent game's player base. With over 500 million players, The Sims remains the largest brand in life-simulation games.",
      "Miele credits the game's successful longevity to it being an open canvas for creators to express themselves no matter their age.",
      "\"A player, whether you're 12 or 82, you can always be connected at the culture that you love through The Sims,\" Miele  said.",
      "The Sims continues to resonate with culture-makers too. This year, Grammy award winner Doja Cat joined The Sims' celebratory 25-hour livestream, as did Chappell Roan, the newly crowned best new artist who expressed interest in being Simmified, aiming to join the likes of the Black Eyed Peas and Glass Animals' Dave Bayley, who have recorded their songs in Simlish, the fictional language created for the game.",
      "\"Simlish was a brilliant, brilliant concept for The Sims, I have to say,\" said Rachel Franklin, EA's senior vice president and group general manager of lifestyle entertainment. \"What it does is it allows the player to be able to say, 'Hmm, I think they're saying this,' and allowing for choice and creativity and meaning that's directly connected to the player.\"",
      "Under Franklin's direction, The Sims 4 has become the most widely played title in the franchise, offering players unparalleled control over the customization of their Sims and their environments.",
      "\"We get stories all the time about how people, for example, they want to be an architect, and so they go and they play with building in The Sims, and that translates into, 'Hey, I was able to get my dream job as an architect because of all of that time I spent playing,'\" Franklin  said.",
      "\"There's also a lot of people that experiment with their own lives in The Sims, where some people will build a family, find what makes them happy through this cause and effect with these little people,\" she said. \"It's a safe space, and it's an optimistic universe. It's a place where, in the end, it all works out.\"",
      "As The Sims celebrates its 25th anniversary, its legacy is undeniable.",
      "\"In terms of importance, it is very close to the top of the list,\" said Salvador. \"When you think about games that really broke ground for what video games could be, you see, you know, Doom, which is the game, one of the first games that was a first-person shooter that really clicked on. You see something like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, obviously. The Sims deserves to be in that same conversation.\"",
      "And as to why the game is still relevant, Salvador said, \"Everybody brings a little of themselves into the game. Everyone gets something a little bit different out of it, far more than what the developers ever intended. How many games can say that?\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:51:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "summary": "Blake Lively alleged she was not the only woman concerned about Justin Baldoni's \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior.\"",
    "story": [
      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "A jury found rapper A$AP Rocky not guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm Tuesday following a nearly month-long trial in Los Angeles.",
      "Screams were heard inside the courtroom upon the reading of the verdict as Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug his longtime partner, Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if convicted of all charges.",
      "At the start of the trial last month, he rejected a plea deal which carried a sentence of 180 days in jail.",
      "\"We said from day one, he was innocent. He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,\" Joe Tacopina, his defense attorney, told reporters outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown LA, where photographers swarmed Rocky and Rihanna following the verdict. \"We're honored to have represented this amazing family.\"",
      "Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged Rocky shot twice in the direction of his former friend, Terell Ephron, near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. Ephron, another former member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob who previously went by A$AP Relli, has said he was left with bullet-graze wounds above his knuckles. He testified that Rocky had allegedly threatened to kill him the same night.",
      "The defense accused Ephron of fabricating evidence, committing perjury and attempting to extort Rocky, saying the rapper had a prop gun that only fired blanks which he carried around for security.",
      "Rocky pleaded not guilty to both counts and maintained his innocence through statements by his attorneys.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman released a statement on behalf of the prosecution after Tuesday's verdict.",
      "\"While today's verdict is not the outcome we sought, we respect the jury's decision and the integrity of our justice system,\" Hochman said in the statement. \"Our office remains committed to seeking accountability for those who break the law, no matter their status or influence. Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.\"",
      "As closing arguments got underway late last week, Rihanna appeared inside the downtown LA courtroom with the couple's 2-year-old and 1-year-old sons with her for the first time, the\u00a0Associated Press reported.",
      "A$AP Rocky stands trial in Los Angeles",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

    "summary": "Banksy's \"Crude Oil (Vettriano),\" valued at $6 million, hits Sotheby's auction block March 4. Some proceeds will go to Los Angeles wildfire victims.",
    "story": [
      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \"Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.\"",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",
      "The painting is on display at Sotheby's in New York until Thursday and in London Feb. 26-March 4.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.",
      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",
      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",

      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",

      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:38:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Tax accountants urge Americans to file early this year to avoid delays in getting your 2025 tax refund.",
    "story": [
      "Tax filing season is upon us, and some people are worried it may take longer to get their refunds as President Trump says he intends to make\u00a0significant cuts\u00a0to the IRS during its busy period.",
      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

      "Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% on Friday, marking their worst one-day declines since December 18, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2%.",
      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",
      "\"Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\"",
      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",
      "Consumers say they are broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from last month's forecast of 3.3% inflation, the University of Michigan survey found. That fits with preliminary data the survey suggested earlier, though a divide is evident underneath the surface.",
      "Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.",
      "A third economic report, meanwhile, said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates have been hurting the housing market.",
      "Walmart, Akamai",
      "Other corporate reports have added to the sense of unease on Wall Street, including Walmart's most recent earnings report. The retailing giant on Thursday provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart shares slipped 2.5% on Friday, following a 6.5% decline on the prior day.",
      "\"With policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\" noted Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

      "The call to action \u2014 or rather inaction \u2014 is asking that American consumers refrain from making any purchases at major retailers on Friday, February 28. The protest comes as people continue to endure\u00a0rising prices on everything from food and gas to housing and utilities, epitomized by the soaring cost of eggs which in January\u00a0averaged $4.95 a dozen.",
      "Behind the boycott is a group called The People's Union USA, a self-described grassroots organization founded by John Schwarz, a 57-year-old dad originally from Queens, New York, who has been promoting the consumer blackout for weeks on social media. The People's Union says it has no political affiliation, but focuses on \"fairness, economic justice and real systemic change.\"",

However, official messaging from The People's Union suggests a boycott of all major retailers, with the goal of enacting broader economic change.",
      "\"For our entire lives, they have told us we have no choice ... that we have to accept these insane prices, the corporate greed, the billionaire tax breaks, all while we struggle to just to get by,\" Schwarz said in a video posted to his Instagram account. \"February 28, the 24-hour economic blackout: no Amazon, no Walmart, no fast food, no gas, not a single unnecessary dollar spent ... for one day, we are going to finally turn the tables.\"",

      "Why February 28?",
      "Schwarz explains on Instagram that he originally picked the Feb. 28 date to provide \"time to get amped up, to push this out there and really spread the word.\"",
      "What is the 24-hour economic blackout?",
      "According to an email circulating for the 24-hour Economic Blackout, The People's Union is urging consumers to halt all purchases, both online and in stores, from starting at 12 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 28 through 11:59 p.m. that same day.",
      "The idea is to halt spending at big corporations, Schwarz said.",

      "Will the Feb. 28 blackout make an impact?",
      "Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, contributing almost 70% of GDP, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But some critics say that halting spending for a single day isn't likely to make much impact on major retailers.",

      "But, he added, the economic blackout could become bigger, snowballing into more events across the U.S. The People's Union is planning additional blackouts aimed at specific retailers, such as an event from March 7-14 to halt spending at Amazon.",
      "Schwarz expresses optimism in his videos that the economic blackout could make an impact. \"If a million people on the 28th do not spend a dime, you might not think out of 360 million people in this country that's a lot, but a million people all on one day not spending their money, that is a hit,\" he said.",

Along with protecting gold reserves, Fort Knox is currently also used as the Army's human resources command center, and it hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",
      "\"We're going to open up the the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,\" Trump said in a speech to Republican governors Thursday evening.",

      "The Army post is about 35 miles south of Louisville and encompasses 109,000 acres in three Kentucky counties \u2014 Bullitt, Hardin, and Mead.",
      "Camp Knox was established during World War I and became an artillery training center, according to the Army post's website. It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known since then as Fort Knox. The first gold arrived at Fort Knox in 1937 with the 1st Cavalry Regiment called on to guard the shipment.",
      "With the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the Army created the Armored Force at Fort Knox, and thousands of soldiers were ordered there and introduced to the tank. For nearly 80 years, the post was known as the \"Home of Cavalry and Armor.\"",
      "In 2005, the Army decided to move the Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence was established at Fort Knox. In 2013, ROTC Cadet Summer Training was consolidated at Fort Knox. The post hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.",
      "According to the U.S. Mint, current gold holdings at the US Bullion Depository at Fort Knox are 147.3 million ounces. About half of the Treasury's stored gold is kept at Fort Knox.",
      "Heavily guarded vaults seen by few",
      "Has the gold ever been removed? The Mint says only very small quantities have been removed to test the purity of the gold during regularly scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold's book value is $42.22 per ounce.",
      "The depository is very secure. The actual structure and content of the facility is known by only a few, and no one person knows all the procedures to open the vault.",
      "What is known publicly is that the facility was built in 1936 using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel. The facility is heavily guarded and has broken its strict policy of not allowing visitors only three times.",
      "In 1974, the US Mint opened the vaults to a group of journalists and a congressional delegation so they could see the gold reserves. The Treasury secretary allowed the visit after persistent rumors that the gold had been removed. Until then, the only person other than authorized personnel to access the vaults was President Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "Since then, the vaults have been opened one other time: In 2017, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin visited with Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and congressional representatives. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he would happily arrange an inspection for any senator who is interested in seeing the vaults.",
      "The gold depository at Fort Knox has a reputation for being impenetrable, which has gained it a place in popular culture. As early as 1952, a Looney Tunes cartoon featured Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam digging for gold in Fort Knox. Fort Knox has also been featured in the plot of movies such as the 1964 James Bond spy thriller \"Goldfinger\" and the 1981 comedy \"Stripes,\" which was partially filmed at the post.",

    "summary": "Amazon MGM Studios and longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights.",
    "story": [
      "In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry,\u00a0Amazon MGM\u00a0announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",
      "Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.",
      "\"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Amazon bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $6.1 billion, a purchase that was significantly motivated by the acquisition of one of the movies' most beloved and long-running franchises. Since the Daniel Craig era of 007\u00a0concluded with 2021's \"No Time to Die,\"\u00a0Broccoli and Wilson have reportedly clashed with Amazon MGM over the direction of Bond.",
      "The announcement Thursday means that for the first time in more than half a century of Bond, a Broccoli won't be greenlighting the next 007 film, or picking who inherits his tux. Amazon MGM also anticipates expanding the franchise beyond movies.",
      "\"We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theaters around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We are honored to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.\"",
      "Bond had been a family business since Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli secured the rights to adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels and kicked off a run of 25 Bond films produced by Eon Productions, beginning with 1962's \"Dr. No.\" Those movies have accrued $7.6 billion in the box office.",
      "In 1995, the elder Broccoli handed over control of Eon to his daughter, Broccoli, and stepson, Wilson. In recent years, the 64-year-old Broccoli has largely taken the lead as Wilson, 83, has aged into retirement.",
      "\"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli,\" Broccoli said in a statement. \"I have had the honor of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of 'No Time to Die' and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.\"",
      "Broccoli and Wilson's previous standoff with Amazon MGM had essentially frozen development on the next Bond movie. No script, director or star has yet been announced for the next installment, an unusually long break for a franchise that has typically spaced films two or three years apart. Broccoli also produced the\u00a02022 film \"Till\"\u00a0and the musical \"Buena Vista Social Club,\" opening next month on Broadway.",
      "A key point for the producers in the Amazon acquisition of MGM was a commitment to theatrically release James Bond films. That Bond's future is now in the hands of an e-commerce giant with one of the leading streaming services will immediately prompt doubts from some fans about Bond's new corporate overloads. Other billion-dollar movie franchises, such as the Disney-owned \"Star Wars\" and Marvel brands, have struggled with over-saturation in recent years.",
      "Even Joe Russo, co-director of four Marvel Cinematic Universe films including \"Avengers: Endgame,\" pleaded to Amazon MGM: \"DON'T cinematic universe James Bond.\"",
      "\"It is one of our last, great theatrical events,\" Russo said on X. \"Don't dilute that with a plethora of streaming spin-offs.\"",
      "In an interview last fall ahead of receiving an honorary Oscar alongside her brother, Broccoli told The Associated Press that, in an era of upheaval in the movie industry, boldness was necessary.",
      "\"People are playing it very safe,\" Broccoli said. \"I think in times of crisis like this, you've got to be brave.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 08:34:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 05:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA is already limited in policing claims of health benefits by makers of supplements and herbal remedies \u2014 a $70 billion industry. Get ready for even less regulation.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, before being named the senior U.S. health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration would liberate Americans from the FDA's \"aggressive suppression\" of vitamins, dietary supplements, and other substances \u2014 ending the federal agency's \"war on public health,\" as he put it.",
      "In fact, the FDA can't even require that supplements be effective before they are sold. When Congress, at the agency's urging, last considered legislation to require makers of vitamins, herbal remedies, and other pills and potions to show proof of their safety and worth before marketing the products, it got more negative mail, phone calls, and telegrams than at any time since the Vietnam War, by some accounts. The backlash resulted in a 1994 law that enabled the dietary supplement industry to put its products on the market without testing and to tout unproven benefits, as long as the touting doesn't include claims to treat or cure a disease. Annual industry revenues have grown from $4 billion to $70 billion since.",
      "With Kennedy now in the driver's seat, the industry will likely expect more: It aims to make bolder health claims for its products and even get the government, private insurers, and flexible spending accounts to pay for supplements, essentially putting them on an equal footing with FDA-approved pharmaceuticals.",
      "On Feb. 13, the day he swore in Kennedy as secretary of Health and Human Services, President Donald Trump issued a \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda targeting alleged corruption in health regulatory agencies and instructing them to \"ensure the availability of expanded treatment options and the flexibility for health insurance coverage to provide benefits that support beneficial lifestyle changes and disease prevention.\"",
      "Kennedy has said exercise, dietary supplements, and nutrition, rather than pharmaceutical products, are key to good health. Supplement makers want consumers to be able to use programs like health savings accounts, Medicare, and even benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to pay for such items as vitamins, fish oil, protein powders, and probiotics.",
      "\"Essentially they're seeking a government subsidy,\" said Pieter Cohen, a Harvard University physician who studies supplements.",
      "As the Senate Finance Committee questioned Kennedy during his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing, supporters in the Alliance for Natural Health lunched on quinoa salad in a U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and crowed that the moment had finally arrived for their health freedom movement, which has combined libertarian capitalism and mistrust of the medical establishment to champion unregulated compounds since the 19th century.",
      "\"The greatest opportunity of our lifetimes is before us,\" said Jonathan Emord, the group's general counsel, who has brought many successful lawsuits against the FDA's restrictions on unproven health claims. \"RFK has dedicated his whole life to opposing the undue influence\" of the pharmaceutical industry and \"assuring that our interests triumph,\" Emord said.",
      "In speeches and in a pamphlet called \"The MAHA Mandate,\" Emord and alliance founder Robert Verkerk said Kennedy would free companies to make greater claims for their products' alleged benefits. Emord said his group was preparing to sue the FDA to prevent it from restricting non-pharmaceutical production of substances like biopeptides \u2014 complex molecules related to drugs like Ozempic.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not respond to a request for comment on the agency's plans vis-\u00e0-vis dietary supplements.",
      "While the basic law governing the FDA establishes that a substance alleged to have treatment or curative effects is by definition a \"drug,\" and therefore comes under the agency's requirements for high standards of scientific evidence, the new administration could reallocate money away from enforcement, said Mitch Zeller, former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "As a Senate aide early in his career, Zeller investigated a tainted L-tryptophan supplement that killed at least 30 people and sickened thousands in the U.S. in 1989. The scandal led the FDA to seek heavier regulation of supplements, but a powerful backlash resulted in the relatively weak supplements law of 1994.",
      "Even that law's enforcement could be undercut with a stroke of the pen that would keep FDA inspectors out of the field, Zeller said.",
      "Sweeping changes couldn't come too soon for Nathan Jones, founder and CEO of Xlear, a company that makes products containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener. The Federal Trade Commission sued Xlear in 2021 for making what it called false claims that its nasal spray could prevent and treat COVID.",
      "Jones points to a handful of studies evaluating whether xylitol prevents cavities and infections, saying the FDA would require overly expensive studies to get xylitol approved as a drug. Meanwhile, he said, dentists have been bought out by \"Big Toothpaste.\"",
      "One can hardly find any products \"without fluoride for oral health,\" he said. \"Crest and Colgate don't want it to happen,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's desire to rid water supplies of fluoride because of its alleged impact on children's IQ is welcome news, he said, and not only because it could highlight the value of his products. Jones stresses, as do many health freedom advocates, that clean air and water and unadulterated food do more to prevent and cure disease than vaccines and drugs. For example, he and other advocates claim, wrongly, that the United States eliminated the crippling disease polio through better sanitation, not vaccination.",
      "The Alliance for Natural Health hopes that in lieu of strict FDA standards, Kennedy will enable companies to make expanded marketing claims based on evidence from non-FDA sources, Verkerk said, such as the National Institutes of Health's nutritional information site, which describes the pros and cons of different supplements.",
      "Kennedy has also called for relaxing the strictures on psychedelic drugs, which interest some veterans as potential remedies for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder. VETS, a San Diego-based organization, has paid for 1,000 veterans to get treatment with the powerful hallucinogen ibogaine at clinics in Mexico and other countries, said the group's co-founder, Amber Capone.",
      "She got involved after her husband, a retired Navy SEAL, pulled out of a suicidal spiral after spending a week at an ibogaine clinic near Tijuana, Mexico, in 2017. She wants NIH, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund research on the illegal substance \u2014 which can cause cardiac complications and is listed as a Schedule I drug, on par with heroin and LSD \u2014 so it can be made legally available when appropriate.",
      "Coincidentally, the push for less onerous standards on supplements and psychedelics would come while Kennedy is demanding \"gold-standard science\" to review preservatives and other food additives that he has said could play a role in the country's high rate of chronic diseases.",
      "\"Put aside the fact that there's precious little evidence to support\" that idea, said Stuart Pape, a former FDA food center attorney. \"There's been no indication they want the same rigor for supplements and nutraceuticals.\"",
      "Although most of these products don't have major safety concerns, \"we have no idea which products work, so in the best case people are throwing away a ton of money,\" Zeller said. \"The worst-case scenario is they are relying on unproven products to treat underlying conditions, and time is going by when they could have been using more effective FDA-authorized products for diseases.\"",
      "Supplement makers aren't entirely unified. Groups such as the Consumer Healthcare Products Association and the Council for Responsible Nutrition have advocated for the FDA to crack down on products that are unsafe or falsely represented. The Alliance for Natural Health and the Natural Products Association, meanwhile, largely want the government to get out of the way.",
      "\"The time has come to embrace a radical shift \u2014 from reactive disease management to proactive health cultivation, from top-down public health diktats to personalized, individual-centric care,\" Emord and Verkerk state in their \"MAHA Mandate.\"",

More than half of these employees \u2014 over 3,500 \u2014 are expected to be from just one division at the IRS, according to text of an email obtained by CBS News and shared by an IRS employee.",
      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "According to an email sent to IRS managers in one division Thursday morning, probationary employees terminated were supposed to receive these emails by 12 p.m. ET. Managers were not copied on these emails, but CBS News obtained a copy of the termination memo.",
      "The guidance said all separation actions will be final Thursday. Terminated employees are to be paid for a full day Thursday, and the guidance says \"administrative leave will cover the balance of the day after they depart.\" Federal probationary employees who have worked for under a year are not entitled to severance.",

      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",

We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30.

      "Finalized in December, the rule requires that airlines offer annual training for workers who interact with disabled passengers, and that those with disabilities get prompt assistance during their travels. If a wheelchair is checked but is delayed, missing or damaged, the rule requires that passengers be told options including the right to file a claim or receive a loaner device.",
      "\"For wheelchair and scooter users, like myself, our mobility equipment is our freedom and independence, which is why an estimated 1 in 10 disabled people do not fly because of fear of damage to their equipment,\" Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, said in a statement at the time.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\" Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:39:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had claimed that DOGE found evidence of 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits.",
    "story": [
      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",
      "Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" said Lee Dudek, the new acting Social Security Administration commissioner who was placed in the role by President Trump, in the Feb. 19\u00a0statement.",
      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\"",
      "DOGE at the Social Security Administration",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, reiterated the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the statement acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",

      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Trump's nominee to run the Labor Department, appeared before a Senate committee for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, where she has faced questions about her support for a pro-union bill when she was in Congress and other labor issues.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer addressed her support for the bill in her opening statement, saying she recognized the legislation was \"imperfect\" and would implement President Trump's labor policies if confirmed as secretary.",
      "\"If confirmed, my job will be to implement President Trump's policy vision. And my guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principal \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",
      "In January, Paul predicted that Chavez-DeRemer could lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But so far, he's been the only GOP senator to publicly pull his support.",
      "\"I'm the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right-to-work but would preempt state law on right-to-work \u2014 I think it's not a good thing,\" Paul told NBC News last month. \"And it'd be sort of hard for me, since it's a big issue for me, to support her.\"",
      "Paul questioned Chavez-DeRemer about right-to-work policies during the hearing, asking whether she is still supportive of the PRO Act, which he said would have overturned right-to-work laws in half the country. When Chavez-DeRemer said she \"fully\" supports states that \"want to protect their right to work,\" Paul doubled down, asking if she no longer supports the aspects of the PRO Act that would have overturned state right-to-work laws. She said she did not.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer will need at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer could pick up support from Democrats for her pro-union stances, but many are fuming over the president's ongoing overhaul of the executive branch and firings of federal workers. Democrats expressed appreciation for Chavez-DeRemer's record during the hearing, but none emerged as clear backers of her nomination.",
      "So far, Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed with minimal GOP defections. Three Republicans voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republicans have otherwise united behind Mr. Trump's picks, with the exception of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against three nominees as of last week.",

But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",

They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",

      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades.

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Department of Government Efficiency representatives went to the Pentagon Friday for meetings with defense officials, marking the start of another project to cut costs in the federal government.",
      "\"Great kickoff with @DeptofDefense,\" the X account for DOGE said Friday. \"Looking forward to working together to safely save taxpayer dollars and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Two defense officials confirmed DOGE personnel's visit, but the Defense Department declined to comment on who specifically attended those meetings.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him in Europe that he was looking forward to working with DOGE.",
      "\"We welcome DOGE to the Pentagon, and I hope to welcome Elon to the Pentagon very soon and his team, working in collaboration with us,\" Hegseth said last week. \"There are waste, redundancies and headcounts in headquarters that need to be addressed.\"",
      "The Defense Department has an annual budget of over $800 billion and more than 3 million personnel, including civilian employees and military service members. The nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation notes that defense spending represents nearly half of all discretionary spending in the U.S. \u2014 47% in 2024 \u2014 and the U.S. spends more than the next nine countries combined on defense.",
      "\"Where we can find billions of dollars \u2014 and he's right to say billions \u2014 inside the Defense Department, every dollar we save there is a dollar that goes to warfighters, and that's good for the American people,\" Hegseth said, adding that climate programs might be an area to consider for cuts.",
      "He did not elaborate on what other areas of the department's budget were likely to be targeted.",
      "The Trump administration has been asked whether there is any oversight of DOGE's cost-cutting effort, since it was created by Elon Musk, whose companies are estimated to have contracts with the federal government totalling billions of dollars through SpaceX, Starlink and Tesla. Reuters noted that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell has estimated that the company had $22 billion in U.S. contracts, $15 billion from NASA. An exact accounting of Musk's defense contracts can't be established, however, because a number of the contracts are classified.",
      "In a lawsuit filed by several Democratic state attorneys general against Mr. Trump and Musk that challenges Musk's appointment and his access to data in several departments, the White House said Musk is not the administrator of DOGE and is not employed by DOGE. Joshua Fisher, the White House director of the Office of Administration, in a filing with the court defined Musk's role as special adviser to the president, similar to the role of Anita Dunn in the Biden administration.",
      "In the lawsuit, the state attorneys general are arguing that Mr. Trump \"delegated virtually unchecked authority to Mr. Musk without proper legal authorization from Congress.\"",
      "The Trump administration has presented Musk as the leader of the cost-cutting effort on several occasions. In the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump asked Musk to detail what \"your team\" has found.",
      "\"Elon is a great patriot,\" Hegseth said during the briefing with reporters in Europe, adding that DOGE and the Defense Department would work in coordination.",
      "\"We're not going to do things that are to the detriment of American operational or tactical capabilities,\" Hegseth said.",

      "Since Mr. Trump tapped Musk\u00a0to head\u00a0DOGE, Musk's team\u00a0has gone about\u00a0slashing thousands of federal positions across numerous agencies. DOGE has also stoked controversy\u00a0by seeking access\u00a0to sensitive government data.",

      "The corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams will continue, for now.",
      "A judge on Friday appointed outside attorney Paul Clement to argue before the court over the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice's request to drop the federal charges.",
      "Clement is a former U.S. solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court. Clement, of Clement and Murphy PLLC, is considered a political conservative, and was appointed by the judge as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court.",
      "The court has ordered that legal briefs be submitted by March 7 and, if needed, oral arguments in the case will take place at 2 p.m. March 14.",
      "The decision came after\u00a0Judge Dale Ho held a Wednesday hearing\u00a0for prosecutors, Adams and his attorneys to discuss the requested dismissal. Prosecutors said the case interfered with Adams' 2025 mayoral campaign and his ability to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The hearing did not include anyone presenting opposition to dropping the case.",
      "\"Normally, courts are aided in their decision-making through our system of adversarial testing, which can be particularly helpful in cases presenting unusual fact patterns or in cases of great public importance,\" Judge Ho wrote.",
      "\"The Court notes that it has considered the parties' views with respect to the appointment of amicus and concludes that an appointment is appropriate here to assist the court's decision making,\" Judge Ho wrote. \"That is particularly so in light of the public importance of this case, which calls for careful deliberation.\"",
      "The judge also noted that in light of the concerns raised by parties in court Wednesday about Adams' responsibilities and the burden of the court, the mayor doesn't have to appear at future proceedings related to this.",
      "Meanwhile, Adams' trial, which had been set for April 21, has been taken off the calendar indefinitely.",
      "\"The Court reiterates that it understands the importance of prompt resolution of the pending motion and will endeavor to rule expeditiously after briefing (and, if necessary, oral argument) is complete,\" Judge Ho wrote.",
      "Justice Department's rationale for dropping the case",
      "Adams was\u00a0indicted\u00a0last September on five counts of bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations, including allegations he accepted illegal campaign donations from Turkish businessmen in exchange for political favors.\u00a0Adams vehemently denied the charges\u00a0and suggested they were brought as payback for his criticism of the\u00a0Biden administration's handling of the border and the migrant crisis.",
      "In requesting prosecutors drop the charges, the Department of Justice said the case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\" in New York City.",
      "The DOJ request, however, noted that it \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based.\"",
      "DOJ request leads to numerous resignations",
      "The request to drop the case led to\u00a0a flurry of resignations, including Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney of the Southern District of New York. In her resignation letter, Sassoon said the Justice Department's request to drop charges \"raises serious concerns,\" left her \"baffled,\" and she thought amounted to an \"improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal in the case.\"",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "\"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us,\" Adams' attorney \u00a0Alex Spiro told CBS News.",
      "Adams faced blowback from within his own administration after Sassoon leveled that accusation.\u00a0Four deputy mayors resigned\u00a0after word came down that the DOJ would seek to drop charges.",
      "That prompted\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul to call a meeting with various key leaders\u00a0to discuss whether Adams should remain in office or whether she should\u00a0use her power to remove him\u00a0- something that has never been done in New York's 235-year history.",
      "Hochul ultimately decided to impose what she called \"guardrails\" on Adams. She\u00a0announced three actions aimed at limiting Adams' power\u00a0by letting other city officials go around him to challenge Trump administration actions.",
      "\"While there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers' power by limiting the authority of my office, I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong,\" Adams said in a statement.",
      "What is Adams accused of?",
      "In the historic indictment, federal prosecutors alleged the mayor abused his power for nearly a decade, soliciting illegal campaign donations from wealthy foreign businesspeople and corporations, including at least one Turkish government official.",

Instead, law enforcement agencies could privately search for information on whether a new hire or officer within their ranks had a documented history of abuse, or of violating department policies or law, for example racial bias or excessive use of force.",

      "According to Bains, the Biden administration built the database in direct consultation with policing agencies, civil rights groups, and academics, and specifically included due process protections for individual officers, giving them the ability to challenge the inclusion of any potential mistaken information.",

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would deny Mr. Trump's bid for relief. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "A key issue at this stage in the case is whether the temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, which briefly reinstated Dellinger, could be appealed by the Justice Department. Gorsuch, in a dissenting opinion joined by Alito, wrote that \"there are powerful reasons to look behind the label, acknowledge that this TRO presently acts as a preliminary injunction, and review its lawfulness.\" Preliminary injunctions can be appealed.",
      "He said he would have tossed out the district court's order and sent it back for a second look.",
      "The president's request for emergency relief from the high court marked his first since returning to the White House in late January. But the Supreme Court is soon likely to be fielding numerous requests for it to intervene in cases arising from actions taken by Mr. Trump in his first weeks in office, as dozens of lawsuits have been filed in courts across the country that seek to invalidate the president's policies.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose out of Mr. Trump's decision to remove Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that aims to protect federal employees from retaliation for whistleblowing. The agency also enforces the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by government workers.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But the special counsel received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office on Feb. 7 informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, a federal district judge in Washington ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel for three days to preserve the status quo. Two days later, the judge, Jackson, granted a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from removing Dellinger from his position as special counsel while she considered whether to issue a preliminary injunction.",
      "Jackson limited the order to 14 days \u2014 until Feb. 26 \u2014 and scheduled a hearing for that day to consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction.",
      "The Justice Department appealed the district court's temporary restraining order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to intervene. In a divided 2-1 decision issued Saturday night, the D.C. Circuit said the order is not appealable.",
      "\"The relief requested by the government is a sharp departure from established procedures that balance and protect the interests of litigants, and ensure the orderly consideration of cases before the district court and this court,\" the D.C. Circuit said in an unsigned decision over the dissent of Judge Gregory Katsas, appointed by Mr. Trump.",
      "The court noted that Dellinger's case involves \"weighty constitutional issues,\" and said it would be best to wait until the district court issues a ruling on the preliminary injunction, which can be appealed and will rest on a fuller record to review.",
      "Mr. Trump then asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the case \"involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers that warrants immediate relief.\"",
      "\"Until now, as far as we are aware, no court in American history has wielded an injunction to force the president to retain an agency head whom the president believes should not be entrusted with executive power and to prevent the president from relying on his preferred replacement,\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a filing, in reference to the district court's order.",
      "She argued that the ruling harms the presidency by curtailing his ability to manage the executive branch in the first weeks of his administration and asked the high court to toss out the district court's order. The acting solicitor general also said that prior Supreme Court decisions have made clear that under Article II of the Constitution, the president has the power to remove at-will the single head of an agency, like the special counsel.",
      "But Dellinger's lawyers argued that it is too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene and warned that if it were to grant the Trump administration's request for relief, it would invite \"a rocket docket straight to this court, even as high-stakes emergency litigation proliferates across the country.\"",
      "\"At bottom, there is no merit to the government's effort to declare a five-alarm fire based on a short-lived TRO that preserves the status quo ante as prescribed by a half-century-old statute,\" they wrote in a filing opposing Mr. Trump's request.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the presidency for a second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, all of which have sparked legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump also offered the more than two million federal employees the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30 through a \"deferred resignation\" program, which roughly 75,000 workers accepted.",

    "summary": "President Trump has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of his plan to shrink the size of the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday declined to block the Trump administration from putting thousands of employees with U.S. Agency for International Development on administrative leave and recalling others from overseas, clearing the way for President Trump to resume his efforts to overhaul the agency as part of his plans to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, denied a request for a preliminary injunction sought by two labor unions that represent members of the Foreign Service and civilian employees. Nichols had issued a temporary order earlier this month that prevented the administration from placing thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and evacuating workers from overseas posts, and ordered the Trump administration to reinstate USAID workers who had already been placed on leave.",
      "But in turning down the request for the preliminary injunction, Nichols now allows the Trump administration to resume those efforts.",
      "In a 26-page decision, the judge said that the employment-related injuries asserted by the unions did not warrant the remedy of emergency relief that they had sought. He said the Justice Department had persuaded the court that the risk to USAID employees placed on administrative leave is \"far more minimal than it initially appeared.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have presented no irreparable harm they or their members are imminently likely to suffer from the hypothetical future dissolution of USAID,\" Nichols wrote, adding that those employees who are likely to be put on leave can address their concerns with the applicable government body for employee complaints.",
      "He added that complaints from the unions about the effects on their members stemming from being placed on leave and asked to return to the U.S. are \"archetypal complaints about changed employment conditions and their follow-on effects \u2014 which at this point appear to be largely financial.\"",
      "The judge also noted that federal laws allow domestic USAID employees or their union representative to object to being placed on administrative leave, indicating that the district court likely lacks jurisdiction over the unions' claims.",
      "Nichols found that the Trump administration had made a justifiable case that the actions at issue\u00a0\"are essential to its policy goals.\"",
      "Despite the unions' argument that USAID workers currently overseas had been stranded and locked out of computer systems, at times in dangerous situations, Nichols found that protections in place to keep workers stationed overseas safe were adequate, based on declarations from current USAID leadership.",
      "USAID, which was established in 1961, emerged as an early target for Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department Government Efficiency, or DOGE, as part of their plan to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Shortly after coming into office for his second term, the president ordered a 90-day pause on foreign aid, upending foreign development projects overseas and throwing contractors, nonprofit organizations and international aid groups into uncertainty.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed Congress earlier this month that the administration would begin the process of potentially reorganizing USAID. As part of that effort, more than 2,100 employees were placed on administrative leave, while the agency determined that roughly 611 staff were essential. It also ordered those in overseas posts to return to the U.S.",
      "The agency had planned to place an additional 2,000 USAID workers on administrative leave by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 7, but Nichols issued a temporary restraining order blocking the action and requiring the Trump administration to reinstate those already affected.",
      "USAID employs more than 10,000 people, according to the Congressional Research Service, and roughly 4,800 are direct-hire who are stationed in foreign and domestic posts.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts aimed at USAID have sparked several lawsuits, including another brought by a group of nonprofit organizations and contractors that received funding for foreign aid projects.",
      "While the Trump administration is clear to put over 4,000 USAID employees on administrative leave in the dispute involving the unions, a federal judge in the case brought by the nonprofit groups has prevented the Trump administration from pausing foreign aid, grants and contracts while legal proceedings continue.",
      "In addition to USAID, the Trump administration has been firing federal workers from across the government. Earlier this week, a federal judge allowed Mr. Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce to continue, declining a request to halt the terminations of government employees en masse as part of a separate lawsuit from a group of labor unions.",
      "As of Friday, at least 12,000 federal employees have been fired by the Trump administration, a CBS News analysis found.",

      "Several Republican lawmakers have faced backlash from constituents in recent days over President Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal government, which have been spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, a task force led by Elon Musk.",
      "With the House in recess, many members of Congress have held town halls and attended other events in their districts this week, giving their constituents a chance to confront lawmakers in person to express their discontent about budget cuts and the layoffs of federal workers by DOGE.",
      "Rep. Rich McCormick, a Georgia Republican, clashed with constituents throughout a packed town hall in Roswell on Thursday. One attendee pressed McCormick on why the administration was taking \"such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach\" to the layoffs, noting that the administration has tried to rehire some employees working on bird flu and the nation's nuclear weapons programs after they were fired.",
      "Another, who said she was a descendent of Patrick Henry's sisters, said \"tyranny is rising in the White House\" and Mr. Trump has \"declared himself king.\" She pressed McCormick on what he would do to \"rein in the megalomaniac in the White House.\"",
      "\"When you talk about tyranny, when you talk about presidential power, I remember having the same discussion with Republicans when Biden was elected,\" McCormick responded.",
      "McCormick, who received loud boos for his response, then compared the crowd to the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. That led to another round of boos, with some attendees yelling, \"Shame!\"",
      "Maggie Goldman, who lives in Roswell's district, told CBS News that she helped organize some of the people who attended the town hall, adding that many were not supporters of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I think there were conservatives there,\" Goldman said. \"I think there were Republicans there that were also not happy.

      "The local news outlet also reported that the Washington County Democratic Party had encouraged people to show up to the meeting with Fitzgerald with signs.",
      "Republican Rep. Nick Begich of Alaska held a telephone town hall on Monday, where a constituent told the congressman his top priority should be the \"strength and resilience of our democracy\" and began asking him about checks and balances on the executive branch before the call went silent.",
      "\"I'm a lifelong Republican,\" the man said. \"But I am in the majority, I think, with a lot of Americans, a lot of Alaskans, that are really concerned that we have an executive branch that is more than willing to push or remove the guardrails that are on the executive branch and what we need from Congress and from the courts is to play that checks and balances role, not not to oppose obviously \u2014\"",
      "Begich said that he's received many questions on the topic and expects challenges to the Trump administration's actions to end up at the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If the Congress or the executive branch steps outside of its constitutionally defined boundaries, the courts step in and realign and say, 'Hey, you're out of bounds,'\" Begich said.",
      "At his own town hall in Baker City, Oregon, on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Cliff Bentz told constituents there's a \"serious question\" about the limits of the president's constitutional authority in reducing the federal workforce, the Baker City Herald reported. But Bentz, too, said the courts would ultimately hold the administration accountable.",

      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed Vitello's reassignment, saying he \"is no longer in an Administrative role, but is instead overseeing all field and enforcement operations: finding, arresting, and deporting illegal aliens, which is a major priority of the President and Secretary Noem.\"",

      "In a court filing in Ocala, Florida, a newly appointed top federal prosecutor has recommended a judge dismiss the remaining federal criminal count against Daniel Ball, who was pardoned last month for his role in the Capitol attack. Ball was still facing a weapons charge for illegal possession of a gun and ammunition seized from his home in 2023.",
      "Though President Trump's pardon cleared Ball of federal charges he faced for his role in the riot, Ball was re-arrested days after the pardon because he still faced the felony firearm charge. Prosecutors had previously argued that Ball was unlawfully in possession of the gun because he had a felony history of domestic violence and strangulation.",
      "His supporters argued the gun case should be dropped because the firearm was only discovered as part of the FBI's probe into Ball's Jan. 6 case. Sara Sweeney, who was sworn in Tuesday as the new acting U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, has asked a judge to dismiss Ball's gun case.",
      "In her filing, Sweeney said, \"[T]he United States hereby moves to dismiss the indictment pending against the defendant, Daniel Charles Ball, with prejudice. The United States cites to the Executive Order dated January 20, 2025 , Granting Pardons and Commutation of Sentences for Certain Offenses Relating to the Events at or Near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, as the reason for this dismissal.\"",
      "Sweeney's office filed the motion under 48 hours after she took over as the lead federal prosecutor in Central Florida.",
      "Ball had pleaded not guilty to federal charges involving the gun and his role in the Capitol siege. Federal prosecutors accused Ball of throwing an explosive device in the direction of police during the Jan. 6 attack. The Justice Department alleged, \"Ball worked with other rioters to violently push against fully uniformed police officers attempting to keep individuals out of the Capitol Building. When that attempt was unsuccessful, Ball moved back into the crowd and threw an explosive device into the entranceway.\"",
      "In court filings, prosecutors also made allegations of a separate gun possession crime, writing, \"During a search of Ball's home, agents discovered ammunition for a .223 rifle and ammunition for a .762 rifle as well as a loaded\u2014though unchambered\u2014.22 rifle. During the same search, agents found multiple commercially produced \"m-style\" explosive devices, the same style of device Ball would later tell agents he threw at officers on January 6.\"",
      "On Feb. 7, Ball's defense attorney argued for the dismissal of the gun case, arguing, \"President Trump issued a flurry of first day executive actions including a pardon to all January 6th defendants who had been convicted and ordering their immediate release. In addition, the executive order directed the Department of Justice to dismiss with prejudice all related cases pending January 6th.\" Ball's lawyer italicized and used a bold font to emphasize the phrase \"all related cases.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 12:24:00 -0500",
    "summary": "DOGE touted the sale of a historic Washington, D.C., property that had been boarded up for years \u2014 but the auction happened before President Trump took office.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, has continued to slash through federal agencies, firing workers and canceling contracts. But as it tallies its savings online, there are continuing indications that the group, which President Trump has referred to as Musk's team of \"super geniuses,\" is overstating its achievements.",
      "The latest sign of this is the DOGE claim in a recent post on X that it succeeded in selling off a historic Washington, D.C., property that has been boarded up for years.",
      "The historic Webster School building was actually sold at auction in December for $4 million under the Biden administration. Records show that a company called Webster School LLC with members Katie Dang and Hung Tran were the purchasers. The sale appears to have been finalized on Feb. 5, 2025.",
      "Long owned by the federal government, Webster has more recently stood as a visible reminder of the impact of vacant or underutilized federal buildings in the District, a problem that local leaders and congressional lawmakers have scrutinized with escalating intensity after the pandemic upended in-person office work.",
      "D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the District in Congress, made the sale of the property a priority for years.",
      "\"The Webster School has been vacant since the 1980s and fallen into disrepair,\" Holmes Norton said when announcing a renewed push to sell the building in the summer of 2023. \"During my service in Congress, I have worked to transfer unused or underused federal land in D.C. to D.C. or the private sector to redevelop neighborhoods and to generate tax revenue for D.C.\"",
      "The property in downtown Washington was originally built in 1882 and has served over the years as a school \u2014 for White children during segregation, for assimilating immigrants after World War I, and for pregnant teens, according to the Washington Post. But it has stood vacant for decades.",
      "The federal government's General Services Administration, or GSA, initiated the auction in September 2024, with bidding commencing in November. The process concluded on Dec. 16, 2024, when an undisclosed bidder secured the property for approximately $4.138 million.",
      "The DOGE attempt to take credit for the sale \u2014 and add the savings to its tally of success \u2014 is part of an emerging pattern. As CBS News previously reported, DOGE has erroneously claimed credit for savings including an $8 billion contract that was actually worth $8 million, and $3.8 million of the contract had already been expended.",
      "The old Webster School building is situated close to the U.S. Secret Service headquarters and faced strict security restrictions that complicated efforts to sell or repurpose it.",
      "Recognizing the need to address these challenges, Congress passed a bill in 2024 aimed at easing restrictions on the sale of the property. This paved the way for the GSA to put the Webster School up for auction in late 2024, ultimately leading to its sale in December. This was part of a larger effort by the GSA to dispose of underutilized properties.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:11:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Around 100 were fired from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
    "story": [
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",
      "At the agency's communications team, whose work is aimed at raising awareness about the 988 hotline, a SAMHSA employee said a quarter of their team had been lost over the last month.",
      "\"People on the federal staff who oversee and are working to raise awareness of 988 nationally are the people who are gone,\" the employee, Stacey Palosky, posted on LinkedIn.",
      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",
      "That includes funding for the call centers that make up the 988 hotline, run largely by state and local governments around the country, as well as the nonprofit that administers it.",
      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",
      "The workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.",
      "Over the same time, survey scores of employee satisfaction at SAMHSA dropped to a record low of 27 out of 100, far below the average for federal agencies.",
      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",
      "It is not clear how many total workers were ultimately cut from HHS.",
      "At SAMHSA, officials remaining at the agency said the firings were frustrating, undoing hard-won hires in some cases for needed positions.",
      "One health official warned of a repeat from the \"doom loop\" that plagued the agency during the first Trump administration, where most of the highest performing workers fled SAMHSA for jobs in the private sector, feeding a drop in morale.",
      "Some staff remained because they were committed to public service, the official said. But many others remained because they were stuck in their jobs at SAMHSA, either because of personal circumstances or because they were unable to get hired elsewhere.",
      "\"Last time it took them two or three years to induce the doom loop. This time they have done it in less than a month,\" the official said.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Many of the dozens of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's actions hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Dozens of lawsuits have been filed in the past month challenging executive actions President Trump has taken since the start of his second term in office, and federal courts from coast to coast have started scrutinizing the president's plans.",
      "The challenges are aimed at unwinding many of the president's policies, which they believe are unlawful. They have targeted his plans to\u00a0crack down on illegal immigration,\u00a0shrink the size\u00a0of the federal government and cut\u00a0spending, as well as Mr. Trump's pledge to end what he believes is\u00a0the weaponization of the Justice Department and FBI.",
      "Many of the lawsuits hinge on alleged violations of decades-old federal laws: The Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act and the Impoundment Control Act. The measures prescribe certain procedures and policies that the executive branch must follow when it comes to taking certain actions.",
      "Here is what to know about each of the laws:",
      "Administrative Procedure Act",
      "Lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's actions on gender ideology, immigration, civil service rules, FBI agents, deferred resignations, USAID cuts, foreign aid pauses and federal assistance freezes all have one thing in common: they allege the Trump administration and senior officials have violated the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "Enacted by Congress in 1946, the law, known as the APA, established the process that federal agencies must follow when creating new rules and regulations, and how courts review those actions. The law's requirements do not apply to the president.",
      "\"In the late 1940s, at a time when agencies were doing more and more, and agencies often had their own procedures for doing certain things, Congress wanted to largely standardize the procedures that agencies need to go through when they either make or repeal or reform a regulation or when they take specific action through agency adjudication,\" said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court and the administrative state.",
      "The APA requires agencies to provide the public with notice of a proposed rule and the chance to offer written comment on it. Once the notice-and-comment period is closed, the agency then publishes its final rule in the Federal Register. This must be done at least 30 days before the rule takes effect.",
      "Courts reviewing a challenged agency action typically consider whether an agency's action is \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The standard of review requires an agency to show that it engaged in \"reasoned decisionmaking\" by providing an adequate explanation for its decision, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agency also has to provide \"the essential facts upon which the administrative decision was based.\"",
      "\"To make a rule, an agency under the APA normally has to give reasons for its rule, and arbitrary and capricious review is a consideration of those reasons,\" White said.",
      "Arbitrary and capricious review is deferential to the agency, which will often prevail in cases alleging violations of the APA if their explanation is \"even plausibly reasonable,\" White said.",
      "\"The government usually wins because it's a very deferential standard of review, but every once in a while it loses because it just didn't connect the dots on the policy it was trying to explain,\" he said.",
      "Most of the lawsuits filed against the Trump administration that seek to invalidate its actions allege violations of the APA, and specifically claim the targeted policies are arbitrary and capricious.",
      "In one of the cases that challenges a memo freezing federal assistance, a group of nonprofit organizations argues that the funding pause is arbitrary and capricious \"in multiple respects.\" The suit argues that the directive fails to acknowledge the \"catastrophic practical consequences\" of halting federal assistance and did not articulate why a review of existing grant programs requires they be paused.",
      "But the challengers also allege that OMB does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze federal financial assistance programs government-wide.",
      "The APA has tripped up the last two administrations.",
      "In a decision from June 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump's rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, or DACA, violated the APA. The high court found the rescission was arbitrary and capricious, and said the first Trump administration failed to consider certain issues when it walked back the DACA program, such as the impacts to young people who were enrolled.",
      "Then, in its last term, the Supreme Court blocked a rule from the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden that aimed to address the harmful smog that travels from certain states. The court said a group of states that challenged the rule were likely to prevail on their claim that it was arbitrary and capricious, in part because of the EPA's decisionmaking regarding concerns raised during the notice-and-comment period.",
      "Privacy Act",
      "Enacted in 1974, the Privacy Act was passed during the Watergate scandal and at the advent of new technologies like mainframe computer systems that allowed for the storage of millions of Americans' information.",
      "\"It was Congress' effort to control what government may do with the information it collects about American citizens and to provide, to a limited degree, an ability for American citizens to review and respond to that use through lawsuits and more particularly through congressional oversight,\" Paul Rosenzweig, an expert in homeland security and national security, told CBS News.",
      "The law governs the government's collection and use of Americans' information kept by agencies. It lays out how the government must store that information, who can access it and when the government can use the data or disclose it. The Privacy Act also prohibits agencies from disclosing records pertaining to an individual without their written consent, unless it falls under an exception.",
      "These 12 exceptions allow the government to use personal information in certain circumstances without the individual's approval, such as for law enforcement activity, or when the information cannot be tied with a specific person, such as for statistical research. A \"need-to-know\" exception lets an agency disclose Privacy Act records to its officers and employees who need the record to perform their duties, while another allows disclosure when the information is needed for a \"routine use.\"",
      "The Privacy Act gives Americans the right to sue an agency for an alleged violation of the law. A well-known case was brought by Linda Tripp, who was a central figure in the impeachment scandal involving former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Tripp accused the Defense Department of violating the Privacy Act by disclosing personal information to a newspaper. She filed three lawsuits against the agency, and the case eventually ended with a settlement in which the Defense Department agreed to pay Tripp $595,000.",
      "Now, the law has been invoked in several lawsuits stemming from the work of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was established by Mr. Trump as part of his efforts to shrink the size of government.",
      "In November, the president said Elon Musk would lead DOGE, though the White House has since said he is a special government employee and senior adviser to Mr. Trump, and not the administrator of the task force.",
      "Since DOGE's formal creation on Mr. Trump's first day in office, its employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies and started accessing data systems. But their efforts have raised concerns among labor unions and Democratic-led states, which have in turn filed lawsuits seeking to block\u00a0 DOGE's access.",
      "\"This is a novel set of circumstances involving wholesale disclosures and wholesale access,\" Rosenzweig said. He noted that while Privacy Act lawsuits typically center on a specific person's complaint, \"we've never seen that many suits of this scope and scale. We've also never seen an administration purport to authorize access to such a wide range of people who would not normally be given access: special government employees in DOGE.\"",
      "The suits allege that several agencies \u2014 including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Treasury\u00a0and Education\u00a0\u2014 have violated the Privacy Act by disclosing Americans' personal information to DOGE staff without their consent.",
      "\"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE.' And federal law says they do not have to,\" lawyers for a group of unions wrote in a lawsuit against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent challenging DOGE's access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "But the Trump administration has argued that DOGE employees are authorized to access the records and are being supervised by the agencies to which they have been detailed. At the Treasury Department, for example, Justice Department lawyers invoked the need-to-know exception and said in a filing that DOGE team members were agency employees who have a need for the records to perform their duties.",
      "\"Need-to-know is based upon need and thus the asserted justification for why they must have access is fair ground for court-based inquiry,\" Rosenzweig said. \"For as long as the Privacy Act has been around, that need has been measured by both the asserted government interests and, to some degree, the sensitivity of the data at issue. It's not canonical, but it is a common-sense assessment that if you really want to know my health records, you better have a damn good reason.\"",
      "The cases are in their early stages, and no judge has ruled definitively on whether the Trump administration has violated the Privacy Act by allowing Musk and DOGE access to agency records without Americans' consent.",
      "Judges have, though, denied preliminary requests to prevent DOGE staff from getting into systems at some agencies. In one decision from U.S. District Judge John Bates, the court found that a group of labor unions was unlikely to succeed on their claims that the Trump administration is violating the Privacy Act by allowing DOGE access to systems at the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act",
      "Court fights aimed at the Trump administration's 90-day pause on foreign development assistance argue that it is violating the Impoundment Control Act, while federal judges overseeing cases involving the Office of Management and Budget's memo halting federal aid have both cited the law.",
      "Enacted in 1974, the law aimed to reassert Congress' power of the purse by providing the procedures for when a president wants to suspend appropriations that have already been approved by Congress. The law was enacted following attempts by President Richard Nixon's administration to not spend money that had been appropriated by Congress, according to the Government Accountability Office.",
      "The measure allows the president to temporarily withhold or cut approved funds in certain circumstances. But under the law, he must first send a \"special message\" to Congress that details the request to rescind or withhold funds. In the case of rescissions, Congress must then pass legislation cutting the funding.",
      "The administration's attempts to halt foreign aid and federal assistance programs may have been aimed at sparking legal challenges to the Impoundment Control Act, as they have done.",
      "OMB Director Russell Vought said during his confirmation hearing that Mr. Trump believes the impoundment law is unconstitutional.",
      "In decisions temporarily halting the administration's funding freeze while litigation continues, judges have raised the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan\u00a0pointed to the Impoundment Control Act as one example of the legislature prohibiting \"the executive branch from encroaching on Congress's appropriations power.\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a separate ruling in which he found there is \"no evidence that the executive has followed the law by notifying Congress\" to bring about a pause that would be legally allowed.",

Such an impact, if it occurred, would have the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at U.S. space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a00.28% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA said it expects the probability \"to continue to evolve\" as scientists gather new observations of the asteroid in the days and weeks ahead.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 1 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a routine discovery\" that doesn't pose an unusual level of danger.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75% of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",

      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:26:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

    "title": "Vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer shows promise in new study",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at U.S. space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a00.28% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA said it expects the probability \"to continue to evolve\" as scientists gather new observations of the asteroid in the days and weeks ahead.",

      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",

      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75% of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",

      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation.

      "Elon Musk has debuted a new version of his artificial intelligence chatbot, called Grok 3, days after rival OpenAI rejected the billionaire's bid for the company, which he cofounded with Sam Altman and others in 2015.",
      "Musk's startup, xAI, claimed in a livestream announcement on Musk-owned social media platform X that Grok 3 is superior to competitors including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Alphabet's Google Gemini, DeepSeek's V3 model and Anthropic's Claude.",
      "With its latest AI chatbot, xAI's mission according to Musk, is to \"understand the universe,\" including by answering questions such as, \"Where are the aliens?\" \"How does the universe end?\" and \"How did it start?\"",
      "Grok 3 surpasses the computer power of its previous iteration, Grok 2 by more than 10 times, xAI engineers said in an hour-long, livestreamed presentation on X.",
      "The company's claims about the AI's computing power and capabilities across categories such as mathematical reasoning, science and coding have not been independently verified.",
      "During the X livestream, xAI demoed Grok 3, asking the chatbot to plot a launch from earth to planet Mars, and back to earth at a future launch date. Musk and his engineers also asked it to create a game that is a hybrid between Tetris and Bejeweled, and to \"make it insanely great.\"",
      "The company noted that Grok 3 is learning every day, and that users can expect to see improvements in the AI every 24 hours.",
      "Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a member of OpenAI's founding team, gave Grok 3 a \"quick vibe check,\" posting a review of the tool on X.",
      "He praised its \"state-of-the-art thinking model,\" which he said is as good as OpenAI's and superior to DeepSeek's, Gemini's and Claude's.",

      "Meta has removed over a dozen fraudulent, sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on the company's Facebook platform.",
      "Dozens of fake, highly sexualized images of the actors Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Scarlett Johansson and former tennis star Maria Sharapova have been shared widely by multiple Facebook accounts, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and many reshares on the platform.",
      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts. This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement emailed on Friday.",

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",
      "CBS News has sought comments from Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, and Maria Sharapova on this story. Johansson declined to issue any comment, according to a representative for the actor.",
      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",
      "Meta is not the only social media company to face the issue of widespread, sexualized deepfake content.",
      "Last year, Elon Musk's platform X temporarily blocked Taylor Swift-related searches after AI-generated fake pornographic images in the likeness of the singer circulated widely on the platform and garnered millions of views and impressions.",
      "\"Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,\" the platform's safety team said in a post at the time.",
      "A study published earlier this month by the U.K. government found the number of deepfake images on social media platforms expanding at a rapid rate, with the government projecting that 8 million deepfakes would be shared this year, up from 500,000 in 2023.",

      "\"I've spoken to President Putin, and I think that thing is going to end. It's got to end,\" he said, referencing his talk with Putin earlier this month. \"It's a horrible, horrible thing to watch. I'm dealing with President Zelensky. I'm dealing with President Putin.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said he wants Ukraine to \"give something up\" for additional aid.",
      "\"I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up. And I'm going to try and get the war settled, and I'm going to try and get all that death ended,\" he said at CPAC. \"So we're asking for rare earth and oil, anything we can get.\"",
      "Following Mr. Trump's CPAC address, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters regarding negotiations that the \"president is very confident we can get it done this week.\"",
      "Leavitt added that Mr. Trump is \"going to be working around the clock all weekend to get a deal and end this conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn't take part, and he postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday. European allies have also\u00a0expressed concerns\u00a0that they are being sidelined.",
      "Zelenskyy is \"not ready\" to sign a minerals deal with the U.S., a source told AFP on Saturday, despite growing pressure from U.S. officials. Ukraine wants any agreement signed with the U.S. to include security guarantees.",
      "\"In the form in which the draft is now, the president is not ready to accept, we are still trying to make changes and add constructiveness,\" the source close to the matter said.",
      "Rubio on Friday spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha to reaffirm Mr. Trump's commitment to ending the conflict in Ukraine, including through \"effective action in the United States Security Council,\" Bruce said in a statement.",

      "U.S. offers United Nations resolution on war",
      "The U.S. offered a draft U.N. resolution that stops far short of a competing European-backed statement demanding an immediate withdrawal of all of Moscow's forces from Ukraine.",
      "Both are timed to the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which falls on Monday, when the General Assembly will vote on the nonbinding resolutions.",
      "The short U.S. draft resolution acknowledges \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" and \"implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.\"",
      "Rubio, in a statement late Friday, said the U.S. believes \"this is the moment to commit to ending the war. This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace.\" He said that \"while challenges may arise, the goal of lasting peace remains achievable\" and that with the resolution, \"we affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.\"",
      "By contrast, the draft resolution from the European Union and Ukraine refers to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation\" and recalls the need to implement all previous assembly resolutions \"adopted in response to the aggression against Ukraine.\"",

    "summary": "Six living hostages \u2014 including two who were held in Gaza for a decade \u2014 were released by Hamas Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military says the sixth and final hostage was released by Hamas in the latest exchange on Saturday and has arrived back in Israel even as heightened tensions clouded the future of\u00a0the fragile ceasefire deal.",
      "The six included three Israeli men seized from the\u00a0Nova music festival\u00a0and another abducted while visiting his family in southern Israel when militants stormed across the border in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel's nearly 16-month campaign in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Two of the hostages had been held by Hamas for around a decade since they each entered Gaza on their own.",
      "Five of the captives were handed over in staged ceremonies that the Red Cross and Israel have condemned in the past \u2014 brought out by masked, armed Hamas fighters in front of hundreds of Palestinians before being transferred to Red Cross vehicles.",
      "In the central town of Nuseirat, Omer Wenkert,\u00a0Omer Shem Tov, and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters on the stage. A beaming Shem Tov even kissed two militants next to him on the head and blew kisses to the crowd.",
      "Watching the release, Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted \"Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!\" and cheered when they saw him for the first time. Shem Tov's grandmother ululated in joy, shrieking, \"Omer, my joy! My life!\" as she saw him.",
      "Cohen's fiance, Ziv Abud, avoided capture by hiding under a pile of bodies the night of the concert. Abud, whose story was told in See It Now Studio's documentary \"We Will Dance Again,\"\u00a0\u00a0told the Daily Telegraph that she knows the man who could come out will be very different from the person who was snatched by Hamas terrorists more than 16 months ago.",
      "\"We will start with the healing and go from there,\" Abud said ahead of his release. \"I want to believe that he is still the same Eliya, that he will love the same things we used to love. We loved to travel. We loved to dance. But we will see. He has had all this time of people telling him what he must do. When he is home he will need to do what he wants to do. And I will be with him, of course.\"",
      "The three men were put in Red Cross vehicles that then headed for Israel. The Israeli military said the three were in their custody and would undergo an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families.",
      "During that reunion, Shem Tov called his parents \"heroes\" as they embraced, laughing and crying, near the Gaza border.",
      "\"You're amazing. You have no idea how much I dreamt of you,\" he said. His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 37 pounds while in captivity.",
      "Earlier Saturday, two other hostages \u2014 Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 \u2014 were freed. Arriving in Israel, both were taken to medical centers for examination.",
      "Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza on his own in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu's family broke out into a Hebrew song, \"Here is the Light,\" as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "\"This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us,\" Shoham's family said in a statement, calling for a deal the be reached for the release of all those still captive. Shoham's wife, two young children, and three other relatives who were abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. \"There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it.\"",
      "Later, Israel's military said the final hostage, Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin Israeli crossed on his own into Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "The release of over 600 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel \u2014 the largest one-day prisoner release in the ceasefire's first phase \u2014 was delayed, apparently for Israeli security consultations on Saturday evening.",
      "Among those set to be released is Nael Barghouti, 67. He has spent 45 years in Israeli jails, more than any other Palestinian. He was first arrested in 1978 for killing an Israeli bus driver. He was released in a prisoner exchange deal in October 2011, then rearrested in 2014 on grounds that he violated his release terms. According to the current exchange agreement, freed prisoners convicted of killing Israelis must be deported, leaving Barghouti unable to return to his home in the West Bank.",
      "Remains of Shiri Bibas returned, family says",
      "The latest hostage exchange is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants.",
      "The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons' bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for \"a cruel and malicious violation,\" while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake.",
      "On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons \u2014 the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades \u2014 said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas' family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers.",
      "\"For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it's here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,\" the family said.",
      "The dispute over the body's identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult.",
      "First phase of ceasefire set to end next week",
      "Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Yael Alexander, whose son Edan is thought to be the last living American hostage, said the situation is a \"nightmare.\"",
      "\"If suddenly they decided 'OK, it's not working, let's stop and that's it, no releases of hostages, this will be a disaster for us the families,\" Alexander said.",
      "The statement from the Bibas family said \"there is no more important goal\" than the release of the remaining hostages.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",
      "Trump's proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries.",
      "Trump said Friday that he was \"a little surprised\" by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it.",
      "\"I'll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that's the plan that really works. But I'm not forcing it. I'm just going to sit back and recommend it,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview.",
      "Israel's military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.",
      "\"We've had enough of war,\" Wahiba Muheisen, who lost her husband and three sons and now lives in a tent beside her ruined home, told CBS News. \"I've lost so much.\"",

    "summary": "Gordon Cordeiro spent three decades in prison in a case involving the killing of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui in 1994.",
    "story": [
      "A Hawaii man who spent 30 years in prison for a murder he long denied committing declared the day \"Freedom Friday\" and said he was eager to visit his mother after a judge ordered him released because of new DNA evidence.",
      "There were gasps and cries in the courtroom when Judge Kirstin Hamman said, \"And the judgement and sentence is vacated and the defendant is ordered to be released from custody,\" before a Zoom feed broadcasting the hearing suddenly turned off.",
      "She ruled that new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial against Gordon Cordeiro.",
      "The case involves the 1994 killing of Timothy Blaisdell during a drug deal robbery on the island of Maui.",
      "Cordeiro's first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him. But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "The Hawaii Innocence Project took up his case, and during a hearing this week it argued that Cordeiro must be released on the grounds of new evidence proving his innocence, ineffectiveness of his previous attorney and prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin said he was disappointed in the ruling and \"None of the judge's findings exonerate him in any way.\"",
      "His office intends to appeal and file a motion seeking to impose bail on Cordeiro's release, Martin added, saying there is a flight risk because a murder charge is involved.",
      "Kenneth Lawson, co-director of the Hawaii Innocence Project, said it was a very emotional moment.",
      "\"He cried, we all cried,\" Lawson said. \"He believed that he was going to be exonerated ... but having gone through two trials, you lose faith in the justice system. To finally hear a judge say, 'I'm vacating your convictions,' that's when it hit him.\"",
      "Cordeiro's conviction and reaction to release",
      "Following his release Cordeiro, now 51, stood outside the Maui Community Correctional Center and talked to reporters, calling it \"Freedom Friday.\" The Associated Press listened by phone from Honolulu.",
      "He said he felt thankful. He thanked his supporters, the judge and even prosecutors who stipulated to certain facts in the case.",
      "\"I'd like to go see my mom,\" Cordeiro said. \"Would be nice.\"",
      "Asked about adjusting to life as a free man after 30 years behind bars, he said, \"I got good support.\"",
      "According to court documents filed by Cordeiro's attorneys, he was wrongfully convicted in part because police relied upon four jailhouse informants motivated by promises of reduced sentences and fabricated murder-for-hire plots.",
      "\"Unfortunately for Cordeiro, the State's use of incentivized jailhouse informants and their fabricated evidence and testimony about the murder-for-hire plots, was enough to convince a jury of his guilt in his second trial,\" the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court filing.",
      "However the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to show that the state intentionally used false testimony and rejected a claim of prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "Cordeiro had several alibis for the day Blaisdell was killed, his attorneys said: The then-22-year-old was at home with his parents and sisters, spending the day building a shelving unit in his family's open-air garage and installing a stereo in his sister's car \u2014 nowhere near the so-called Skid Row area in upcountry Maui where the killing happened.",
      "Blaisdell had gone to Skid Row with a man named Michael Freitas and planned to buy a pound of marijuana with $800 in cash, according to court documents. His body was found at the bottom of a ravine.",
      "Freitas kept changing his story, Cordeiro's attorneys said, and he shifted the blame onto their client, a friend who he falsely believed had \"snitched\" on him in an unrelated drug case.",
      "After Cordeiro's conviction, new testing on physical evidence from the scene excluded him as the source of DNA on Blaisdell's body and other crime scene evidence, the Hawaii Innocence Project said, and a a DNA profile of an unidentified person was found on the inside pockets of Blaisdell's jeans.",
      "The judge agreed that the new DNA evidence and new information about gunshot residue would change the results of a later trial.",
      "Cordeiro's attorneys believe Freitas, who died in 2020, set Blaisdell up to be robbed and was involved in his killing.",
      "\"The police botched this case from the beginning and turned the No. 1 suspect into the state's star witness, resulting in a 30-plus-year nightmare and miscarriage of justice for Gordon and his family,\" Lawson said.",

      "When Sarah and Michael Oliveri went to their 20-week ultrasound for their third pregnancy, they thought to knew what to expect. Their previous visit had been stressful \u2014 doctors had detected an abnormality at 16 weeks \u2014 but a blood test came back clear. They believed the 20-week scan, taken in August 2024, would continue to show everything was fine.",
      "But as the ultrasound went on, doctors \"kept kind of going over the heart,\" Sarah Oliveri told CBS News.",
      "\"They told me in that room that there could potentially be something wrong, and they were sending me down the hall to the cardiology department,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Oliveri said she and her husband went to the cardiology department \"nervous,\" but trusting their doctors to provide care. When they met the cardiologist, they were told their unborn child had a heart block. It was a condition they had never heard of before.",
      "\"They told us it was serious, and there was some fear that we could potentially lose him,\" Sarah Oliveri said. \"But we always, from the very beginning, believed that he was going to be OK.\"",
      "What is heart block?",
      "A heart block means that the heartbeat's signal is not moving from the upper to the lower part of the organ correctly. It can cause a slowed or skipped heartbeat. Depending on the stage of the heart block, the heartbeat may only get through sometimes. In more severe cases, the heartbeat may not get through at all. Heart block can cause low blood flow to the entire body and symptoms like nausea, dizziness and chest pain.",
      "The Oliveri baby had a complete heart block, said NYU Langone pediatric cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Reina Tan.",
      "Tan did not diagnose the condition but joined the treatment team when Sarah Oliveri was around 32 weeks pregnant.",
      "Often, heart block is treated with a pacemaker, which regulates the heart's rhythm. Such devices are rare in children. Only about 1 in 20,000 babies are born with heart block, and of those, Tan said that only 20% have a pacemaker implanted shortly after delivery.",
      "\"It's always a question of timing as to when you would need it,\" Tan said.",
      "Adapting a pacemaker for newborn use",
      "While in utero, the Oliveris' baby wasn't showing signs of distress, but when he was born on Dec. 5, 2024, he had a dangerously low heart rate. Even as the couple celebrated the birth of their third child, named Michael, doctors determined he would need a pacemaker as soon as possible.",
      "\"He was at a very high risk of not making it,\" said Tan.",
      "The baby \u2014 nicknamed Mikey \u2014 was taken to the Hassenfeld Children's Hospital's Congenital Cardiovascular Care Unit, and eventually intubated. Pediatric heart surgeon Dr. T.K. Susheel Kumar placed temporary wires that would simulate the effects of a pacemaker to keep his heart rate up.",
      "Because so few babies are born needing a pacemaker, there are very few options for newborns in need. Babies must weigh between 6.5 and 8 pounds before they can receive a standard pacemaker, Tan said. At 5.5 pounds, Mikey was too small.",
      "Instead, Tan turned to a pacemaker called Micra, made by the biotechnology company Medtronic. That pacemaker is about the size of a vitamin and weighs as much as a penny, Tan explained, but it was still too large for him. A pacemaker that is too large can lead to \"more complications\" in patients, Kumar said. It can move around the body, or the thin wires connecting it to the heart can break.",
      "Tan and other members of the pediatric heart team filed for emergency approval to use an adapted version of the device that was suitable for babies. It's the smallest pacemaker in the world. Only about 50 such devices have ever been implanted in the United States. Kumar said the adapted version is inserted and placed over the heart with just one small surgical incision during a 75-minute procedure.",
      "The day he was born, Mikey was approved for the adapted pacemaker. On December 17, he was taken into surgery.",
      "Thriving after surgery",
      "After the surgery, Mikey stayed in the pediatric cardiovascular care unit for another few weeks, receiving antibiotics to ward off any infection, and being closely monitored. On Jan. 2, 2025, he was discharged. Photos from the day show the month-old infant wearing a graduation cap and blue onesie.",
      "Since his discharge, the family has returned to the hospital multiple times for follow-ups.",
      "In late January, an EKG and check-up showed his heart was operating normally. Those check-ups will take place every other month, Tan said. The Oliveris also has a device at home that \"basically communicates with the pacemaker,\" Tan said, and doctors also review data from that. In several years, the battery on the pacemaker will need to be changed, and at some point, the device will need to be exchanged for a larger option.",
      "But for now, Mikey is thriving at home with his older brothers, aged 3 and 5. At over two and a half months old, he's \"doing really well,\" their mother said.",
      "\"He's doing really well. He's doing great,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed \"until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies\" at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza.",
      "The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office came early Sunday local time as military vehicles that normally move in advance of the buses carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in.",
      "The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released on Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire's first phase.",

      "The Israeli statement cited \"ceremonies that demean the dignity of our hostages and the cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes.\" It was likely a reference to a Hamas video showing two hostages who have yet to be released watching a handover in Gaza on Saturday and speaking under duress.",
      "The six were the last living hostages expected to be freed under the ceasefire's first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Talks on the ceasefire's second phase are yet to start.",
      "The six included three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 13:26:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Six living hostages \u2014 including two who were held in Gaza for a decade \u2014 were released by Hamas Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military says the sixth and final hostage was released by Hamas in the latest exchange on Saturday and has arrived back in Israel even as heightened tensions clouded the future of\u00a0the fragile ceasefire deal.",
      "The six included three Israeli men seized from the\u00a0Nova music festival\u00a0and another abducted while visiting his family in southern Israel when militants stormed across the border in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered Israel's nearly 16-month campaign in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Two of the hostages had been held by Hamas for around a decade since they each entered Gaza on their own.",
      "Five of the captives were handed over in staged ceremonies that the Red Cross and Israel have condemned in the past \u2014 brought out by masked, armed Hamas fighters in front of hundreds of Palestinians before being transferred to Red Cross vehicles.",
      "In the central town of Nuseirat, Omer Wenkert,\u00a0Omer Shem Tov, and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters on the stage. A beaming Shem Tov even kissed two militants next to him on the head and blew kisses to the crowd.",
      "Watching the release, Cohen's family and friends in Israel chanted \"Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!\" and cheered when they saw him for the first time. Shem Tov's grandmother ululated in joy, shrieking, \"Omer, my joy! My life!\" as she saw him.",
      "Cohen's fiance, Ziv Abud, avoided capture by hiding under a pile of bodies the night of the concert. Abud, whose story was told in See It Now Studio's documentary \"We Will Dance Again,\"\u00a0\u00a0told the Daily Telegraph that she knows the man who could come out will be very different from the person who was snatched by Hamas terrorists more than 16 months ago.",
      "\"We will start with the healing and go from there,\" Abud said ahead of his release. \"I want to believe that he is still the same Eliya, that he will love the same things we used to love. We loved to travel. We loved to dance. But we will see. He has had all this time of people telling him what he must do. When he is home he will need to do what he wants to do. And I will be with him, of course.\"",
      "The three men were put in Red Cross vehicles that then headed for Israel. The Israeli military said the three were in their custody and would undergo an initial medical assessment before being reunited with their families.",
      "During that reunion, Shem Tov called his parents \"heroes\" as they embraced, laughing and crying, near the Gaza border.",
      "\"You're amazing. You have no idea how much I dreamt of you,\" he said. His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 37 pounds while in captivity.",
      "Earlier Saturday, two other hostages \u2014 Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38 \u2014 were freed. Arriving in Israel, both were taken to medical centers for examination.",
      "Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza on his own in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. Watching the handover on Israeli media, Mengistu's family broke out into a Hebrew song, \"Here is the Light,\" as they saw him for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "\"This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us,\" Shoham's family said in a statement, calling for a deal the be reached for the release of all those still captive. Shoham's wife, two young children, and three other relatives who were abducted with him were freed in a November 2023 exchange. \"There is a window of opportunity; we must not miss it.\"",
      "Later, Israel's military said the final hostage, Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin Israeli crossed on his own into Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "The release of over 600 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel \u2014 the largest one-day prisoner release in the ceasefire's first phase \u2014 was delayed, apparently for Israeli security consultations on Saturday evening.",
      "Among those set to be released is Nael Barghouti, 67. He has spent 45 years in Israeli jails, more than any other Palestinian. He was first arrested in 1978 for killing an Israeli bus driver. He was released in a prisoner exchange deal in October 2011, then rearrested in 2014 on grounds that he violated his release terms. According to the current exchange agreement, freed prisoners convicted of killing Israelis must be deported, leaving Barghouti unable to return to his home in the West Bank.",
      "Remains of Shiri Bibas returned, family says",
      "The latest hostage exchange is going ahead after tensions mounted over a grisly and heart-wrenching dispute triggered this week when Hamas initially handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother of two young boys abducted by militants.",
      "The remains that Hamas transferred with her sons' bodies on Thursday were later determined to be those of an unidentified Palestinian woman. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed revenge for \"a cruel and malicious violation,\" while Hamas suggested it had been a mistake.",
      "On Friday night, the small militant group believed to have been holding Bibas and her sons \u2014 the Palestinian Mujahedeen Brigades \u2014 said it handed over a second body. On Saturday morning, Bibas' family said Israeli forensic authorities had confirmed the remains were hers.",
      "\"For 16 months we sought certainty, and now that it's here, it brings no comfort, though we hope it marks the beginning of closure,\" the family said.",
      "The dispute over the body's identity raised new doubt about the ceasefire deal, which has paused over 15 months of war but is nearing the end of its first phase. Negotiations over a second phase, in which Hamas would release dozens more hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal, are likely to be even more difficult.",
      "First phase of ceasefire set to end next week",
      "Hamas has said it will also release four more bodies next week, completing the first phase of the ceasefire. If that plan is carried out, Hamas would retain about 60 hostages, about half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Yael Alexander, whose son Edan is thought to be the last living American hostage, said the situation is a \"nightmare.\"",
      "\"If suddenly they decided 'OK, it's not working, let's stop and that's it, no releases of hostages, this will be a disaster for us the families,\" Alexander said.",
      "The statement from the Bibas family said \"there is no more important goal\" than the release of the remaining hostages.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he's committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",
      "Trump's proposal to remove about 2 million Palestinians from Gaza so the U.S. can own and rebuild it has thrown the ceasefire into further doubt. His idea has been welcomed by Netanyahu but universally rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries.",
      "Trump said Friday that he was \"a little surprised\" by rejections of the proposal by Egypt and Jordan and that he would not impose it.",
      "\"I'll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that's the plan that really works. But I'm not forcing it. I'm just going to sit back and recommend it,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview.",
      "Israel's military offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza's population. Many have returned to their homes to find nothing left and no way of rebuilding.",
      "\"We've had enough of war,\" Wahiba Muheisen, who lost her husband and three sons and now lives in a tent beside her ruined home, told CBS News. \"I've lost so much.\"",

While just one man is in the dock \u2014 a former surgeon accused of raping or sexual abusing 299 people, mostly child patients \u2014 activists hope the trial empowers other victims and helps expose other abusers long protected by societal taboos.",

      "Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial starting Monday in Vannes, in the Brittany region of northwestern France. He doesn't deny the charges, though he says he doesn't remember everything.",
      "Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time to undergo surgery at Le Scouarnec's hands.",
      "The trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos surrounding sexual abuse. That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of others, France's symbol of fight against sexual violence.",
      "Child protection and women's rights groups and medical community associations see the trial as an opportunity to reaffirm that shame must change sides.",
      "\"It should also mark a new step towards a justice system that listens and protects victims and firmly convicts aggressors,'' they said in a statement.",
      "The abuse dated back decades",
      "Le Scouarnec faces up to 20 years in prison for rape, sexual assault and indecent acts committed with violence or surprise.",
      "The case began in 2017 when a 6-year-old neighbor denounced Le Scouarnec, who had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",

      "Victims were stunned about what had happened",

I remembered the postoperation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\" one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital at the age of 9 in 1991. \"I cried a lot, but I didn't think something like that had happened to me during this operation.\"",

    "summary": "Hamas is under pressure from Israel and the U.S. at a crucial time for the Gaza ceasefire as it claims it could have misidentified a hostage's remains.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to make Hamas pay \"the full price\" for what he called a \"cruel and wicked violation\" of the tenuous Gaza ceasefire agreement after the Israeli and U.S.-designated terrorist group returned the remains of a Gazan woman instead of an Israeli mother taken hostage with her two young children.",
      "Israeli officials said late Thursday evening that Hamas had handed over the body of an unidentified Gazan woman earlier in the day instead of the remains of Shiri Bibas as expected. In a handover orchestrated under the ceasefire deal that came into effect on Jan. 19, Hamas was supposed to return the bodies on Thursday of Bibas along with her two slain sons, Ariel, 4, and Kfir, who at just nine months old was the youngest of the 251 Israelis seized during the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.",
      "The children's remains were returned, along with the body of Oded Lifshitz, who was 83, but Netanyahu said that instead of Shiri Bibas' remains, Hamas \"put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin.\"",
      "\"May the sacred memory of Oded Lifshitz and Ariel and Kfir Bibas be etched in the heart of the nation forever,\" he said. \"May God avenge their blood. And so will we.\"",
      "Hamas has claimed since November 2023 that Shiri Bibas, her children and Lifshitz were all killed in Israeli bombing in Gaza, along with some militants who were holding them captive. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He was\u00a0released earlier this month\u00a0after 16 months in captivity.",
      "In a statement on Friday, Hamas indicated the handover of a different body the previous day could have been a mistake, claiming there was a \"possibility of an error or overlap in the bodies, which may have resulted from the occupation targeting and bombing the place where the family was located.\"",
      "The statement said Hamas would look at \"these claims with complete seriousness, and we will announce the results clearly,\" and it added that the group wished to, \"confirm our seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations, and we have proven this through our behavior during the past days. We have no interest in not committing [to the ceasefire terms] or keeping any bodies with us.\"",
      "Hamas called on Israel to return the remains of the unidentified Gazan woman to the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces issued a terse statement Friday rejecting Hamas' claim that the Bibas children were killed in an IDF strike.",
      "\"Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood,\" the IDF alleged. \"The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys \u2014 they killed them with their bare hands. Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities. This assessment is based on both forensic findings from the identification process, and intelligence that supports the findings.\"",
      "The incident, along with previous hostage handovers that have seen large crowds of well-armed Hamas terrorists and civilians crowding around freed Israelis and, on Thursday for instance, a massive propaganda poster behind the coffins holding the hostages' remains depicting Netanyahu as a bloody vampire, have drawn fury from Israeli officials and the Trump administration.",
      "The handovers have also been increasingly criticized by the international community \u2014 including by the Red Cross, which has facilitated the physical transfer of hostages, both living and dead, inside Gaza. In a Friday statement to Reuters, the global organization said it was \"concerned and unsatisfied\" with the way the releases have played out.",
      "\"The ICRC does not participate in sorting, screening, or examining the deceased \u2014 this is the responsibility of the parties to the conflict,\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said, according to Reuters, adding concern that the Thursday transfer of remains had not been carried out in a private and dignified manner.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also issued a statement condemning \"the parading of bodies and displaying of the coffins of the deceased Israeli hostages by Hamas on Thursday. Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families.\"",
      "Regardless of any intentionality on the part of Hamas, that handover of the wrong body and Israel's stern reaction to it left the already-fragile ceasefire in an even more perilous position Friday, just a week before the first six-week phase of the deal is set to end. A total of 33 living Israeli hostages were to be handed over during the first phase under the terms of the agreement, the final six of whom should be released Saturday.",
      "There was no immediate indication from Israel or Hamas that Saturday's planned release, and the corresponding release by Israel of scores more Palestinian prisoners from its jails, would not go ahead.",
      "Talks to hammer out the terms of the second phase, due to begin at the start of March, should have begun a couple weeks ago, but there's been no indication from Israel, Hamas, or the U.S. and its regional partners Qatar and Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire, of what progress may or may not have been made.",

      "Netanyahu has been under constant pressure from some far-right members of his cabinet to end the ceasefire and resume Israel's military operation in Gaza, and Netanyahu himself has stressed that the goal of the war has always been to disarm, if not destroy Hamas. In that objective, Israel's government appears to have the firm backing of the Trump administration.",
      "In an interview on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Hamas, \"evil, terrible people, and the idea that they would ever be allowed to continue to have arms and to be militarized and control territory, anywhere in the world, is unfathomable.\"",
      "\"As long as Hamas is in Gaza, there will never be peace in Gaza,\" he said, \"because they are going to go back to attacking Israel, and Israel is going to have to respond.\"",
      "The families of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have been far less eager to see a resumption of fighting, however. In a statement cited Friday by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Kibbutz Nir Oz, the community from which the Bibas children and their mother were abducted, said it stood by the \"clear demands of the Bibas family at this time: release, not revenge.\"",
      "\"The state must bring Shiri back by all means, in a way that will not hinder the continuation of the deal and the immediate release of all hostages,\" the kibbutz community was quoted as saying.",
      "\"Hamas is a murderous organization that does not hesitate to kill infants and toddlers. Our expectations are from the Israeli government, whose actions must be immediate to free all 70 hostages from the hands of the murderers and end the ongoing failure.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of all the Israelis taken captive in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, said in a separate statement that it was \"horrified and devastated by the news\" that Shiri Bibas' remains were not returned.",
      "\"To the world, we say: Do not look away. In Hamas' hell in Gaza, 70 more of our children, brothers, sisters, and parents remain in captivity, enduring unimaginable terror. Do not abandon them to their fate. Save them from this nightmare. Every passing minute is a death sentence for those still alive and a threat to our ability to bring back the fallen for a proper burial.",
      "\"Israel and the international community must stand firm in ensuring that the agreement is upheld while acting with wisdom and urgency to address these blatant violations,\" the group said. \"Every step must be taken with careful responsibility to secure the safe return of all hostages.\"",

      "Francis' doctors delivered their first in-person update on the pope's condition, saying that he will remain hospitalized at least all of next week.

    "summary": "While polling suggests Germany's far-right AfD party will fare well, it's very unlikely to be part of the next government of Europe's biggest economy.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0German voters will cast ballots Sunday in a crucial federal election that could reshape the country's political landscape. With the collapse of the previous coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Germans are expected to choose a new direction for Europe's largest economy.",
      "The frontrunner to become the next German chancellor is Friedrich Merz, leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party. Polls show the CDU enjoying a comfortable lead, with 28% support.",
      "But it's the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that has caught the attention of many analysts ahead of this election. The AfD has surged in popularity and is currently polling second, expected to take about 21% of the vote, while the liberal Social Democratic Party (SPD) is polling at 16%, and the Greens at 14%.",
      "Musk urges Germans to get over \"past guilt\" ahead of Holocaust Remembrance",
      "Musk urges Germans to get over \"past guilt\" ahead of Holocaust Remembrance",
      "It's highly unlikely that any single party will garner anywhere near the outright majority of seats in the parliament, or Bundestag, in this election that would be required under Germany's electoral system to form a new government on its own.",
      "Instead, parties must negotiate alliances to form a government, with the party that takes the most seats generally putting its leader into the chancellor role. This proportional representation system is intended to ensure broader representation and political stability. Coalition governments often require compromises between parties with starkly differing policy priorities, making governance a process of negotiation.",
      "Despite their swelling popularity, all the mainstream German parties, including Merz's CDU, have categorically ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD \u2014 which President Trump's advisor Elon Musk has backed in the elections \u2014 citing the party's links to far-right extremism. That exclusion means it is virtually certain that the AfD will not be part of the next government.",
      "Who is Friedrich Merz, Germany's likely next leader?",
      "Ideologically conservative entrepreneur Merz, 69, is widely expected to become Germany's next chancellor. Known for a straightforward approach to politics, Merz has promised to revitalize Germany's stagnating economy, lower taxes and tighten immigration policies, arguing that the country needs to become more competitive on the global stage.",
      "Merz has also called for Germany to boost its defense spending from the current \u20ac50 billion to \u20ac80 or \u20ac90 billion annually, after 2028, citing concerns over European security and the need to counter Russian aggression \u2014 all the more important as Mr. Trump appears to be realigning U.S. foreign policy away from America's decades-old NATO allies and its firm backing of Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing invasion.",
      "\"It's not just about Ukraine. It's about ensuring peace in Europe,\" Merz said during a recent visit to Kyiv, where he reaffirmed Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression.",
      "Merz sees a growing challenge in Germany's relationship with the U.S. and has warned of a possible \"epochal rupture\" if U.S. leadership continues down an isolationist path. Without naming anyone, he's voiced concern over the possibility of an American president who \"admires authoritarian regimes and disregards various norms,\" and underscored the importance of Europe strengthening its own defense capabilities.",
      "Merz has also proposed the formation of a European defense contact group, including Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Poland, to coordinate strategies more effectively.",
      "Despite his conservative stance, Merz remains committed to Germany's role in the European Union and the NATO alliance. He has called for a unified European approach to global security, ensuring that Germany remains a key player in shaping the continent's future.",
      "Merz has reacted strongly to a spate of recent terrorist attacks in Germany carried out by migrants and asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan.",
      "After a Syrian man, said by authorities to have been inspired by ISIS, killed three people and wounded eight in a knife attack in the city of Solingen, Merz told CBS News that closed-circuit video at all public events is something he'd consider useful.",
      "\"Technically, so much more would be possible than is currently allowed politically,\" he said, referring to security methods now available thanks to advances in video and artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Merz has also backed tougher immigration laws and the rapid deportation of asylum seekers convicted of crimes in Germany.",
      "As Germans head to the polls this weekend, they will essentially be choosing between continuity, and change.",
      "While the CDU under Merz represents a shift toward more conservative policies, the outcome of the election will almost certainly necessitate coalition-building and compromise, so the degree of any change will likely be far less dramatic than, for instance, that ushered in by the last national election in the U.S.",

      "The United States was not one of the nine countries that took part in the exercise, but its role as the longtime cornerstone of the NATO alliance was a focal point among journalists gathered to view a demonstration of the ARF's capabilities on Wednesday. That was just hours after President Trump blamed Ukraine, and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy specifically, for the war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion.",
      "\"Intense\" talks in Kyiv amid Trump-Zelenskyy tension",
      "Mr. Trump went on to blast Zelenskyy as an ineffective leader, even calling him a \"dictator,\" as the Ukrainian president said the American president was living in a \"disinformation space\" created and fostered by Russia. Ukraine has fumed at being left out of the Trump administration's initial talks with Russia, which Mr. Trump claims are going very well and can bring a ceasefire deal, suggesting only Zelenskyy is standing in the way.",
      "Retired U.S. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Mr. Trump's envoy to Russia and Ukraine, has been in Kyiv this week and held meetings with Zelenskyy and other top officials. He was expected to hold a joint news conference with Ukrainian officials on Thursday, but Kyiv said the U.S. had cancelled it. In a social media post, however, Kellogg struck a different tone than Mr. Trump.",
      "Kellogg said it had been a \"long and intense day,\" but that his discussions with Zelenskyy, \"the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team,\" were \"extensive and positive.\"",
      "Reacting in his own post on social media, Zelenskyy agreed that the talks had been intense, but said his meeting with Kellogg, \"restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. \u2014 agreements that will truly work. I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly.\"",
      "\"We follow the orders of our duly elected officials.\"",
      "U.S. Navy Admiral Stuart Munsch, commander of JFC Naples, one of NATO's three Joint Force Commands, which manages the Allied Defense Force, was in Romania to oversee the exercises. He was asked about Mr. Trump's shift away from U.S. support for Ukraine, and toward Russia's longtime talking points on the war.",
      "\"Your president thinks that Ukraine was essentially asking for it [the war]. So do you think it was an unprovoked invasion and why are you disagreeing with your president?\" a British journalist asked Munsch during a news conference.",
      "\"NATO consists of 32 countries, and it's NATO's position that it was unprovoked,\" Munsch responded.",
      "The U.S. and Canada are the only non-European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was formed in 1949 in the wake of World War II. The alliance has played a vital role in maintaining peace in Europe since then, largely thanks to the collective defense clause in Article 5 of NATO's founding charter, which essentially says an attack on one ally will be treated as an attack on all.",
      "\"As a political and military alliance, what we do together at NATO directly contributes to the security, the prosperity, and liberty of the people of the United States and every Ally,\" the U.S. mission to NATO says on its website. \"NATO promotes democratic values and encourages consultation and cooperation on defense and security issues to build trust and, in the long run, prevent conflict. NATO is committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes. If diplomatic efforts fail, it has the military capacity needed to undertake crisis-management operations.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has long argued that the U.S. has spent more than its fair share on what he considers Europe's defense, and that European NATO allies should bear more of the financial burden.",
      "\"The entire NATO alliance is basically structured around the United States,\" Max Bergmann, the director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program and the Stuart Center in Euro-Atlantic and Northern European Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told CBS News. \"All NATO planning is dependent on the United States\u2026 Everyone else sort of docks in, are kind of the limbs, but it's the U.S. that does the basics of blocking, tackling, enabling Europeans to fight together.\"",
      "Bergmann says, however, that this is how the U.S. has historically encouraged the alliance to function.",
      "\"That's how the U .S. has been approaching Europe \u2014 is to say: 'We want you to spend more, but we want you to be utterly dependent on us,'\" Bergmann said. \"And what has happened over the last 10 years, is Europe has been doing that. They've been spending more. They've been providing a lot of aid to Ukraine. But they haven't taken, really, any significant steps to organize themselves to be independent. And now the Trump administration comes and says, 'Well, we're basically leaving Europe.'\"",
      "With the White House seeming to question the importance of NATO to U.S. national security, Bergmann says there's a \"real sense of betrayal felt on both sides [of the Atlantic], and in Europe, I think the perspective is, yeah, we're dependent on the U.S. for defense, and we should have done more, but that's also how the United States has wanted us to be.\"",
      "At the NATO exercise in Romania, CBS News asked Munsch, who was there in his capacity as a NATO commander, about the apparent disconnect between messaging from the White House and the alliance, which has always emphasised the allies' unity.",
      "\"There are discussions going on at the national level,\" Munsch replied. \"There have not been decisions made, so I'm executing currently orders that I have.\"",
      "He said it would be business as usual unless and until he received any new orders.",
      "\"That's the way it is always, right?\" Munsch said. \"We follow the orders of our duly elected officials.\"",

In fact, journalists from all over the globe continue to pour into Ukraine, seeking the front lines, finding the story, doing their jobs.",

The Ukrainian doctor was dead set against moving me, afraid that any passage on the country's gutted, bomb-shelled streets might dislodge the shrapnel in my throat and kill me\u2014one of several ways that leaving the hospital might have cost me my life.",

      "Lively has now claimed she, along with other cast and crew members, experienced \"invasive, unwelcome, unprofessional, and sexually inappropriate behavior\" from Justin Baldoni on the set of \"It Ends With Us.\"",
      "\"As a preliminary matter, having the support of credible witnesses is extremely useful to Lively,\" legal expert Heidi Reavis told Fox News Digital. \"In cases involving subjective experience, third-party witnesses can make or break the case.\"",

      "\"The dangerous climate of threats, harassment, and intimidation fueled by the Defendants\u2019 retaliation campaign has required Ms. Lively to alter her personal and professional life, and to take steps to protect innocent bystanders rather than exposing them to further harm,\" Lively's lawsuit, obtained by Fox News Digital, stated.",
      "\"Thus, this Amended Complaint does not refer to certain witnesses by name, nor does it provide screen shots of their text messages. Importantly, however, these witnesses have given Ms. Lively permission to share the substance of their communications in this Amended Complaint as contained herein, and they will testify and produce responsive documents in the discovery process.\"",

      "Baldoni, in his own lawsuit filed in January, insisted that Lively had \"falsely\" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation after the fallout of the movie's press tour after the actress took control of the film. Baldoni's legal team claimed Lively had no evidence of a deliberate smear campaign and instead worked to repair her reputation by accusing the actor and others of sexual harassment.",

      "\"Our clients have been transparent in providing receipts, real-time documents and video showing a completely different story than what has been manipulated and cherry-picked to the media,\" Freedman said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. \"Our clients have taken this matter and these issues very seriously, notwithstanding the jokes made publicly by the plaintiff and her husband. Her underwhelming amended complaint is filled with unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons who are clearly no longer willing to come forward or publicly support her claims.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively\u2019s false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening,\" Freedman concluded. \"What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively\u2019s lack of actual evidence.\"",

      "For women in particular, Lake highlighted a few key issues the MAHA movement is likely to tackle.",

      "CHILDREN EXPOSED TO HIGHER FLUORIDE LEVELS FOUND TO HAVE LOWER IQS, STUDY REVEALS",

      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's Key Takeaways",
      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",
      "Researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",
      "The airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

      "Hipshipper, a shipping platform used by sellers on eBay, Shopify and Amazon, accidentally exposed millions of shipping labels with personal customer information. Researchers at Cybernews found the exposed data in December 2024, but it wasn't fixed until January, meaning it was open for at least a month. Hipshipper helps people ship packages to over 150 countries, offering tracking, free insurance and easy returns. The exposed shipping labels are important because they detail what's inside the packages and where they\u2019re supposed to go.",
      "However, an unprotected AWS bucket held over 14.3 million records, mainly shipping labels and customs forms. Researchers from Cybernews said,\u00a0\"Cybercriminals can use leaked data to carry out scams and phishing attacks.

      "1) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Watch out for snail mail:\u00a0While many security threats happen online, physical mail can also be a target. With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won't be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports regularly: You can request free credit reports from major credit bureaus to check for any suspicious activity or unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "6) Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "7)\u00a0Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams by removing your personal information from the web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s high time every industry took cybersecurity seriously. If your business operates online, you are just as responsible for protecting customer data as a tech company, possibly even more so, since tech companies typically have stronger safeguards in place. The fact that Hipshipper left a storage bucket containing 14 million records unprotected speaks volumes about how little they prioritize cybersecurity. And it's not just Hipshipper. Many companies dealing with tech products aren\u2019t even careful enough to password-protect their critical documents. This lack of basic security highlights a worrying trend across industries.",

      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",

      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",

Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",

If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",

      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "Illustration of a phantom hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The state legislature then passed the shield law, allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private, but the firing squad remained an option.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon said he chose against lethal injection because of concerns over the three previous executions since the state resumed carrying out the death penalty in September after a 13-year involuntary pause and moved to using a massive dose of pentobarbital. Witnesses to the three prior executions said that despite the men appearing to stop breathing and moving in only a few minutes, they were not declared dead for at least 20 minutes.",

      "\"The only choice that remained is the firing squad. Brad has no illusions about what being shot will do to his body,\" King said. \"He does not wish to inflict that pain on his family, the witnesses, or the execution team.

    "title": "Why the chance that an asteroid might hit Earth in 2032 keeps changing",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "An asteroid has a slight chance of hitting Earth in 2032. Here's why the odds are a moving target, according to the astronomer who invented the scale used to measure such risks.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid between 130 and 300 feet wide has a slight chance of hitting Earth in 2032 \u2014\u00a0but the precise odds have been a moving target since the space rock was first detected nearly two months ago.",
      "NASA\u2019s latest estimate for the asteroid, known as 2024 YR4, is that it has just a 0.28% probability of striking Earth \u2014\u00a0about a 1 in 360 chance. But the agency had put the probability at 1.5% on Wednesday, and the day before that, NASA estimated the chances of a collision to be a record high of 3.1%, or 1 in 32.",
      "Those prior odds made the space rock the first object officially classified as a Level 3 out of 10 in a measurement known as the Torino scale, which astronomer Richard Binzel first proposed nearly three decades ago.",
      "A Level 3 classification means the object merits attention by astronomers, and that it poses a threat of a \u201cclose encounter.\u201d",
      "Named after the Italian city where astronomers officially adopted it in 1999, the Torino Impact Hazard Scale is a way to communicate to the public the risks that near-Earth asteroids and other cosmic objects may pose to the planet.",
      "The scale is color-coded, with categories from 0 (white for no hazard) to 10 (red for certain collisions). When 2024 YR 4 was thought to have a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth, that placed it in the scale\u2019s intermediate yellow zone.",
      "The flurry of news coverage about the asteroid has brought the Torino scale more attention than ever before. Binzel said this type of situation is precisely why he created the system in the first place.",
      "\u201cThe idea was to be as transparent as possible about what astronomers know,\u201d said Binzel, a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit like being between a rock and a hard place because we want to report what we know to maintain public trust, but we also don\u2019t want to raise any unnecessary anxiety.\u201d",
      "The challenges of walking that fine line have been apparent with asteroid 2024 YR4.",
      "The reason the impact probability fell this week, NASA said, is that ground-based telescopes were able to get a better look at the space rock overnight on Feb. 19 and 20. Based on those observations, astronomers have been able to refine models of the asteroid\u2019s orbit, allowing them to more accurately estimate the space rock\u2019s trajectory. This in turn helps scientists predict with more certainty where 2024 YR4 will be on Dec. 22, 2032, the date when the asteroid will likely have its close encounter with Earth.",
      "Although the shifting probabilities have been somewhat dizzying, it\u2019s perfectly normal for a near-Earth asteroid\u2019s chances of impact to dance around like this, according to Binzel.",
      "\u201cIf you think of it like a baseball game, the amount of information we have to track this asteroid is like trying to figure out where a fly ball will land at the crack of the bat,\u201d he said.",
      "In other words, it will take more time to observe and measure the asteroid\u2019s size and path before figuring out if it\u2019s still a threat at all.",
      "When Binzel debuted the Torino scale to the astronomical community decades ago, his goal was to foster greater public awareness of impact risks. The idea, he said, was to implement something similar to the Richter scale that measures an earthquake\u2019s magnitude, or the Saffir-Simpson scale that assigns categories to a hurricane based on its wind speeds.",
      "But when he first presented the system \u2014 at a United Nations conference in 1997 \u2014 it was not well received, he said. Some astronomers, according to Binzel, were skeptical that it would be useful for the public.",
      "That same year, though, scientists discovered an asteroid dubbed 1997 XF11 that some thought could hit Earth in 2028. It didn\u2019t take long for astronomers to rule out a potential collision, but the doomsday narrative proliferated in news reports, followed by blame for what was perceived to be a big mistake.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being a bit of an embarrassment,\u201d Binzel said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that astronomers had made an error, but we didn\u2019t have a good way of communicating uncertainty. So that became the motivation for proposing a simple system for categorizing any object for which we can\u2019t immediately rule out that it will miss the Earth for centuries to come.\u201d",
      "Binzel presented the scale once again at a conference in Torino in 1999 attended by representatives from NASA and the European Space Agency. At that workshop, the system was finally adopted by the International Astronomical Union, a nongovernmental organization made up of professional astronomers that functions like a governing body for the astronomical community.",
      "In addition to its use of colors and numbers corresponding to various risk levels, the scale also includes descriptions of the potential consequences, the likelihood that risk assessments may change, and what actions governments or members of the public should take.",
      "A Level 6 threat in the orange zone, for instance, describes a likely close shave by \u201ca large object posing a serious but still uncertain threat of a global catastrophe.\u201d",
      "Astronomers are advised to give this object \u201ccritical attention\u201d in order to figure out conclusively if a collision will occur. \u201cIf the encounter is less than three decades away, governmental contingency planning may be warranted,\u201d the scale says.",
      "On the other hand, a Level 3 threat means: \u201cCurrent calculations give a 1% or greater chance of collision capable of localized destruction,\u201d according to the scale\u2019s description. \u201cMost likely, new telescopic observations will lead to re-assignment to Level 0. Attention by public and by public officials is merited if the encounter is less than a decade away.\u201d",
      "Unsurprisingly, then, Binzel correctly suspected when asteroid 2024 YR4 was considered a 3 on the scale that it would eventually be downgraded.",
      "But during that brief time, 2024 YR4 did hit some uncomfortable milestones: It was the only known asteroid with a classification above Level 1, and it set records for reaching the highest impact probability and for spending the longest time with a probability greater than 1%, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The only time an asteroid of similar or larger size has been classified higher on the Torino scale was in 2004, when the asteroid Apophis was briefly ranked as a Level 4, with an estimated 2.7% chance of hitting Earth.",
      "To witness the scale function in real time has been gratifying, Binzel said, though he is happy to be discreet about his connection to it.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, if the Torino scale is helpful, there\u2019s enormous satisfaction in that. It really makes my day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is nice to hide my name behind the location where the scale was adopted. That helps keep my phone from ringing too much.\u201d"

      "Most official data continues to show the U.S. economy is humming along, with unemployment historically low and inflation expectations still relatively stable.",
      "Yet under the hood, a wealth divide that had subsided somewhat in the early stages of the pandemic era has suddenly grown more stark: The upper echelons of America\u2019s income distribution \u2014 those making roughly $153,000 in annual income \u2014 are the ones that are now powering much of the spending driving U.S. growth.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans who are not at the top are facing increasing financial difficulties.",
      "The upshot is that the U.S. economy may be exposed to a more acute downturn if prices of the most highly valued assets, like stocks, homes and cryptocurrencies, take a turn for the worse.",
      "\u201cThe fact that consumer spending is so concentrated among folks who are well-to-do makes the economy vulnerable,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics.",
      "Many households in lower income brackets \u2014 approximately $73,000 and below \u2014 still likely have a job,\u00a0and their wages have, on a broad average, largely kept pace with inflation. Yet most are unlikely to own the kinds of assets that have seen rapid appreciation in recent years, Zandi said.",
      "\u201cFor the lower and lower-middle, it has been a struggle,\u201d Zandi said.",
      "Instead, he said, they\u2019ve used credit cards to maintain purchasing power.",
      "Yet the annual percentage rates on those cards have yet to sink below 20%.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s tough to digest financially,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cSo they\u2019re having to continue to make some pretty tough choices.\u201d",
      "As a result, the share of overall consumer debt in delinquency is now at its highest level in nearly five years, according to data published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Meanwhile, the share of credit card accounts showing delinquencies of at least 90 days overdue has climbed to more than 11%, the highest share since 2011 and a greater percentage than any time in the pandemic and post-pandemic era, the data showed.",
      "It\u2019s a similar story for the share of newly delinquent credit cards, which at about 9% are also back at highs not seen since 2011.",
      "And the share of active credit card accounts making just the minimum payment is now at a 12-year high, according to data from Kansas City Federal Reserve.",
      "While income divides have always been present in the U.S. economy, until the pandemic, the pace of spending growth had largely been consistent across all wealth brackets.",
      "But about three years ago, according to a 2024 Federal Reserve report, higher-income households\u2019 spending growth began to accelerate. The trend has persisted into this year, though it is starting to slow somewhat: Anecdotally, even households making above $100,000 \u2014\u00a0a level once considered privileged \u2014 are increasingly turning to options like Walmart to meet spending needs.",
      "Still, the wealthiest U.S. consumers continue to pull away: The most recent data from the FICO credit reporting group shows the share of individuals with credit scores of 750 or greater is at record highs, while the share with scores of less than 600 has begun to creep back up after years of declines.",
      "\u201cMissed payments on bankcards \u2026 have grown to the point that they are now higher than pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Can Arkali, FICO\u2019s senior director for scores and predictive analytics, wrote last fall. \u201cFaced with ongoing economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, and elevated consumer prices, people continue to heavily rely on credit cards for everyday expenses. This can weigh on people \u2014 especially those who are already financially distressed \u2014 and lead to higher credit card utilization and subsequent defaults on credit card payments.\u201d",
      "Nonprime borrowers, who now number in the millions, are facing particular distress.",
      "\u201cFor this segment of the credit population, both payment default and debt levels have been increasing at a higher rate than the trends observed on the total FICO Score population and are now well over pre-pandemic levels,\u201d Arkali wrote.",
      "Despite the worrisome trends, there is no sign of an imminent crisis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d say I feel cautious optimism,\u201d said David Sojka, senior adviser at Equifax, noting that growth in delinquencies has actually slowed. \u201cConsumers are being more judicious in their spending and utilization rates \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re managing how they\u2019re spending relative to their means.\u201d",
      "But the trends are clear.",
      "\u201cCredit card performance is showing signs of consumer stress,\u201d economists with the Philadelphia Federal Reserve wrote last month, adding: \u201cConsumers are not only spending more, leading to higher balances, but paying off less, increasing revolving amounts.\u201d"

    "summary": "Major cuts by the Trump administration, led by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE, are threatening a path to Black financial stability once offered by federal jobs.",
    "story": [
      "When Francine Verdine took a job as a clerk at the Internal Revenue Service in Houston in 1983, it was supposed to be a stopgap until something better came along. She didn\u2019t expect that 42 years later, she would look back on it as the start of a rewarding career that provided growth in various management positions, upward mobility and the opportunity to build a comfortable life for her family.",
      "\u201cI enjoyed my career,\u201d said Verdine, who retired in 2019. \u201cI had no idea when I started that I could make the money I did by the time I left. It\u2019s sad that many others\u2019 opportunity to have a similar career could be over.\u201d",
      "For decades, the federal government provided both reliable jobs and guardrails to offset systemic racial bias in hiring and promotions, offering an alternative for Black workers who might be overlooked or ignored in the private sector. They played a crucial role in helping Black workers like Verdine join the middle class and thrive. But vast cuts by the Trump administration, led by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, are threatening to close down that once-dependable path to financial stability.",
      "The government, which has about 3 million employees, is the largest employer in the country. At least 75,000 of them accepted buyout offers\u00a0 and thousands were fired in the last several weeks. Many of the workers fired were either newer hires or told they were let go for subpar performance.",
      "\u201cThe federal workforce was a means to help build Black middle class. It hired Black Americans at a higher rate than private employers,\u201d said Sheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents the Education Department employees.",
      "As a part of his efforts, President Trump is angling to shut down the Department of Education, a move that will have dramatic repercussions around the country. Nearly 30% of Education employees are Black according to a 2024 report by the department.",
      "Smith said 74 workers at the department had been let go so far, 60 of whom are Black.",
      "At the Department of Health and Human Services, where more than 1,300 new hires were reportedly laid off, 20% of the staff was Black. And at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which recently lost 1,000 employees, 24% are Black.",
      "These numbers illustrate how important government jobs have been and are for Black people, said Marcus Casey, a fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution. He said the administration\u2019s efforts are trying to undermine the gains of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination on the basis of race and other characteristics, and of affirmative action, which began in the federal government to make the hiring and promoting process more inclusive.",
      "\u201cWhether it was from the post office, through direct growth of federal agencies, through the military \u2014 the government fought against the headwinds associated with the private sector,\u201d said Casey, an affiliated scholar with Brookings\u2019 Future of Middle Class Initiative.",
      "Many Black people could build careers through the federal government typically because the private sector overlooked them, regardless of their qualifications, he said. \u201cAnd so, the federal government has been essential to the building of the Black middle class.\u201d",
      "A worker at the Department of Transportation in Washington, D.C, who requested anonymity for fear of being fired, said several workers in his office have been fired for \u201cpoor performance.\u201d",
      "\u201cMorale is so low,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who should be there are gone. Everyone is nervous about the next shoe dropping.\u201d",
      "He said he has 16 years on the job and was planning to retire in four. \u201cI wanted to do an even 20, maybe even 25. But I have to be honest with myself now: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it. Every indicator is that my head will be chopped off sooner or later. How can anyone be productive with that hanging over you?\u201d",
      "Undoing DEI to cut the federal workforce",
      "The president\u2019s sweeping changes began with ending DEI throughout the government, weaponizing it as a \u201cdestructive ideology\u201d along the way. Countless jobs have been lost in an area that was created to develop fair hiring opportunities.",
      "\u201cA lot of Black people not only benefited from what they call DEI now, but the original affirmative action programs, and the veteran preferences,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat combination helped a lot of people get a foothold in the civil service.\u201d These efforts, he said, \u201chelped people get middle-class salaries and build middle-class lives with an ecosystem of race-specific businesses around Black communities.\u201d",
      "Verdine said it\u2019s no secret that the government could be streamlined, but added that the way the administration is going about it is \u201cdisheartening.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no humanity in what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d she said. \u201cNo organization. It\u2019s just chaos and people being hurt.\u201d",
      "Among those facing the chaos are Verdine\u2019s daughter and daughter-in-law, who have disabilities, and are federal workers at the Food and Drug Administration. Under Schedule A, workers with disabilities are allowed a faster hiring process, but their probationary periods are longer than a standard federal employee.",
      "Her family members were reluctant to speak with NBC News about their worries for the future for fear of reprisal. Verdine said they are rightfully fearful, as disabilities are a part of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs that Trump barred two days after being sworn in.",
      "\u201cYou cannot tell where this will go,\u201d she said. \u201cMy daughter and daughter-in-law live in uncertainty. At any time, based on how this has been going, they can get the call that their job is no more.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Verdine stressed that she had to be qualified for the jobs and promotions she obtained, and in some cases, she felt as though she had to be \u201coverly qualified\u201d for positions that she had seen white people, men and women, get with less education, less experience than she had. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I had to train some of those same people. So, the idea that DEI was some pathway to giving Black people jobs, that just wasn\u2019t true,\u201d she said.",
      "Smith, from Local 252, said that although the federal jobs cuts are not labeled as DEI casualties, the pattern is curious.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned as a union that the vagueness of a lot of these executive orders and their implementation are actually a means or pretext to get rid of Black, brown, female members of this workforce for reasons that may not be complying with the law,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0 She added that the majority of\u00a0 people who\u2019ve been forced out by this administration ostensibly based on DEI do not work in DEI, but \u201cthey happen to be Black.\u201d",
      "In addition to regulating America\u2019s schools, the Department of Education enforces Title VI \u201cto make sure that Black and brown students across this country are getting equitable access to education,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat work has been stopped. \u2026 We\u2019ve been told to stop working for the American people.\u201d",
      "Forced into early retirement",
      "Ros Patterson, a 62-year-old benefits department worker at the Veterans Administration in Cole Valley, Illinois, received a phone call on Jan. 28 telling her she had been let go after nearly a year. She said she was told she had 90 minutes to turn in her company laptop.",
      "Flustered and confused, because she was not given a reason for her firing at the time, Patterson drove to Iowa City, Iowa, her closest federal office, and learned that no one there was aware that she was to drop off her laptop \u2014 or had papers for her to sign confirming her termination.",
      "Eventually, someone helped her. About 30 minutes later she learned from now-former colleagues that all VA workers had been offered a buyout that included eight months pay as part of a severance package.",
      "As a probationary employee, she said she was not eligible for it. \u201cI could have used that paycheck as I looked for another job,\u201d Patterson said.",
      "She had not planned to retire, but losing her job forced her to, she said, so she could maintain a semblance of her old life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t left any choice,\u201d said Patterson, who now receives food stamps, is on Medicaid and was approved for Section 8 senior housing. \u201cI understand probationary employees are quick and easy to fire. But it was done in such a duplicitous manner.\u201d",
      "She said she voted for Trump, the orchestrator of the chaos in her life, but is \u201cnot bitter. It is what it is. I\u2019m not blaming Trump. My thing is how it happened. I had no time to process anything or get myself together. It\u2019s cold the way it was done,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d expect the government to do better.\u201d",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods."

      "On a May afternoon two years ago, Christyn Akin-Crockett found herself in an unusual situation. Standing in an alley north of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the church administrator was dressed in black and staring at a run-down single-family home.",
      "Akin-Crockett, 42, had heard that a woman in the area \u2014 identified to her only as \u201cBecka\u201d \u2014 was responsible for multiple killings, including her father\u2019s.",
      "In an interview, Akin-Crockett said she had previously tried to get local authorities to investigate\u00a0Wayne Akin\u2019s death as suspicious. When she\u2019d gone to her father\u2019s apartment after his body was found on April 17, 2023, she said she found women\u2019s shorts and underwear on the floor, and his phone and wallet were missing. But when she went to Columbus police with her concerns, she said, an officer told her investigators had to wait for the results of toxicology testing to determine if Akin\u2019s death was suspicious.",
      "Frustrated, Akin-Crockett said she took matters into her own hands after someone reached out to her family via Facebook with information about his death and who may have been responsible for it. The tip prompted what Akin-Crockett described as a vigilante mission that she said brought her face to face with the woman authorities later identified as Rebecca Auborn, a sex worker and alleged serial killer charged in October 2023 with targeting at least four customers, including Akin, with fatal doses of fentanyl.",
      "Prosecutors have accused Auborn, 34, of killing the men between January and June of that year. She was charged with trying to kill a fifth person in December 2022, an indictment shows.",
      "Auborn has pleaded not guilty and was found competent to stand trial earlier this month. Her lawyer has not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Akin-Crockett said she eventually provided the information \u2014 which came in a series of text messages from a woman who said she\u2019d known Akin \u2014 to a Columbus police detective who investigated her father\u2019s death. But that was months later, Akin-Crockett said, after the June 17, 2023, death of a fourth person whom prosecutors charged Auborn with killing.",
      "Akin-Crockett had two goals with her trip to the alley that day: She wanted her father\u2019s belongings back and she wanted his killer behind bars.",
      "\u201cMy intention,\u201d Akin-Crockett said, was \u201cto tackle her and restrain her until the cops got there.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Columbus Division of Police did not respond to a detailed list of questions about Akin-Crockett\u2019s account but said the department is looking into the matter.",
      "A series of illuminating texts",
      "The messages that led Akin-Crockett to the alley began May 6, 2023, a few weeks after Akin\u2019s death. Akin-Crockett declined to identify the woman who sent the messages to protect her privacy, but she provided screenshots of the texts to NBC News.",
      "Akin-Crockett described her father, a 64-year-old former postal worker who spent years battling drug addiction after a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, as a generous family man whom she became estranged from after his descent into illness and addiction. They began to mend their relationship in the years before his death, she said.",
      "The nature of Akin\u2019s relationship with the woman who reached out to Akin-Crockett was unclear, Akin-Crockett said, but they seemed to be friends.",
      "Akin, the woman wrote in one of the messages, \u201chas you come over you get to relax take a shower he feeds you and spends a lot of money so your happy and all he wants is someone to chill with and talk to.\u201d",
      "In another message, the woman asked how Akin died.",
      "\u201cWas it an overdose because I know who did it,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Akin-Crockett texted back that her father\u2019s cause of death wasn\u2019t clear yet \u2014 authorities had not completed toxicology testing \u2014 but she believed he may have been drugged and left for dead. Akin-Crockett mentioned that his wallet and phone were missing.",
      "\u201cYeah, her name was becka,\u201d the woman responded. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing it\u201d to a few guys. In another text, she added: \u201cYes she murder him this is the 4 person she has done it to but she\u2019s going to get hers just wait you can only do so many bad things before something is done back to you.\u201d",
      "Akin-Crockett asked her to report the details to the Columbus Division of Police, but the woman declined, saying she had warrants and couldn\u2019t go to jail or testify, according to the messages. But the woman provided Akin-Crockett with the name of an intersection with a camera that might have captured Auborn and Akin together before his death.",
      "In the same text, the woman wrote: \u201cI\u2019m guessing she wasn\u2019t smart enough to take his car, so she would need a ride back meaning she\u2019s going to be on camera at the subway across the street from his house.\u201d",
      "Akin-Crockett asked the woman if she knew Auborn\u2019s last name, according to the messages. She didn\u2019t, she said, but she provided detailed instructions about where Akin-Crockett could find her \u2014 an alley near East Weber Road and Atwood Terrace, about a half-mile from Interstate 71.",
      "\u201cWhen you see any females out just pretend like you are family and you have money for her or something and they will show you right where she is,\u201d the woman wrote.",
      "A couple of hours later, the woman sent another message saying Auborn was at a nearby corner store. She described Auborn\u2019s appearance \u2014 short, dirty-blond hair, shorts and a pink hoodie \u2014 and said that she had Akin\u2019s phone and was speaking disparagingly of him.",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t care he was dead,\u201d the woman wrote.",
      "Ready for a confrontation",
      "Akin-Crockett described the location identified by the woman as a fairly rough part of Columbus. Akin-Crockett grew up a mile or two away, she said, and spent her childhood cruising around the area by bike with her siblings.",
      "Because Akin-Crockett was familiar with the neighborhood, she said she didn\u2019t fear a potential confrontation. And besides wearing black stretch pants and a black polo \u2014 Akin-Crockett reasoned that a \u201cvery aggressive demeanor\u201d might ward off potential trouble \u2014 she took no safety precautions when she and her husband parked near the corner store on the afternoon of May 6.",
      "Ittai Crockett said he advised her not to pursue her father\u2019s assailant because it was dangerous and because she would \u201cstick out like a sore thumb,\u201d potentially spooking Auborn and prompting her to flee.",
      "\u201cChristyn, against my wishes, jumped out of the car,\u201d said Ittai Crockett, noting that he is legally blind and remained in their vehicle as his wife began scouring the neighborhood.",
      "By then, neither of the women were at the store, Akin-Crockett said. So she walked to the alley identified by the informant and found what she described as a dingy white house with an old roof.",
      "On the porch, Akin-Crockett saw a woman who appeared to match the informant\u2019s description: she had dirty-blond hair and shorts. But there was no pink hoodie. And she had no way to confirm if the woman was in fact \u201cBecka.\u201d",
      "In a text message, Akin-Crockett had asked the informant for a photo, but she never responded.",
      "Akin-Crockett stared at the house, she said, and the woman with dirty-blond hair remained on the porch for a moment, then went back inside. Moments later, a man emerged, appeared to look at Akin-Crockett, then also went inside.",
      "Akin-Crockett said she watched the house for roughly five minutes \u2014 a period that felt like an eternity \u2014 and weighed her options.",
      "Because she couldn\u2019t say with absolute certainty that she was looking at the woman described by the informant, she said she didn\u2019t want to potentially hassle the wrong person and \u201ccause chaos for no reason.\u201d",
      "Nor did she call authorities \u2014 even though she said she talked with an officer before driving to the neighborhood. The officer told her to dial 911 when she was in the area, Akin-Crockett said.",
      "But given what Akin-Crockett described as lengthy police response times in Columbus and the agency\u2019s prior description of her father\u2019s death as nonsuspicious, she concluded it wasn\u2019t worth calling.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how seriously they\u2019d take it,\u201d she said.",
      "So Akin-Crockett walked back to her car and told Ittai Crockett she thought she saw the woman but couldn\u2019t be certain.",
      "A couple days later, they went to the department\u2019s headquarters to obtain a report related to her father\u2019s death, Akin-Crockett said. While there, she told an officer about the text messages and the camera that might have video of her father with his alleged killer.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Unfortunately, we would have to wait on toxicology,\u2019\u201d Akin-Crockett recalled the officer saying. \u201cOnce that came back, then they could pursue something.\u201d",
      "Charged with murder",
      "It wasn\u2019t until September, three months after the death of a fifth person on June 17, that Akin-Crockett realized the informant had been right \u2014 and the woman she\u2019d seen in the alley was the person later charged with killing her father.",
      "The confirmation came from a news report showing Auborn\u2019s mug shot after her indictment in the killing of one of the four men. Her hair looked different, but she had the same sunken cheeks and sickly demeanor, Akin-Crockett said.",
      "In October, Auborn was charged with dozens more crimes, including the robbery and murder of Akin.",
      "Akin-Crockett was grateful that Auborn was finally off the streets, but her frustration has only intensified over what she views as the department\u2019s inaction in the days and weeks following her father\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cThey had the power to pursue justice right at that moment, but they did not, and that saddens me,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWhen I talk to other people, they\u2019re outraged that we had this information, that we presented this information and it wasn\u2019t taken seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomebody else\u2019s father, brother, loved one should not have had to die,\u201d Ittai Crockett added. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d"

      "HONOLULU \u2014 A Hawaii man who spent 30 years in prison for a murder he long denied committing declared the day \u201cFreedom Friday\u201d and said he was eager to visit his mother after a judge ordered him released because of new DNA evidence.",
      "There were gasps and cries in the courtroom when Judge Kirstin Hamman said, \u201cAnd the judgement and sentence is vacated and the defendant is ordered to be released from custody,\u201d before a Zoom feed broadcasting the hearing suddenly turned off.",
      "She ruled that new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial against Gordon Cordeiro.",
      "The case involves the 1994 killing of Timothy Blaisdell during a drug deal robbery on the island of Maui.",
      "Cordeiro\u2019s first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him. But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "The Hawaii Innocence Project took up his case, and during a hearing this week it argued that Cordeiro must be released on the grounds of new evidence proving his innocence, ineffectiveness of his previous attorney and prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin said he was disappointed in the ruling and \u201cNone of the judge\u2019s findings exonerate him in any way.\u201d",
      "His office intends to appeal and file a motion seeking to impose bail on Cordeiro\u2019s release, Martin added, saying there is a flight risk because a murder charge is involved.",
      "Kenneth Lawson, co-director of the Hawaii Innocence Project, said it was a very emotional moment.",
      "\u201cHe cried, we all cried,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHe believed that he was going to be exonerated ... but having gone through two trials, you lose faith in the justice system. To finally hear a judge say, \u2018I\u2019m vacating your convictions,\u2019 that\u2019s when it hit him.\u201d",
      "Following his release Cordeiro, now 51, stood outside the Maui Community Correctional Center and talked to reporters, calling it \u201cFreedom Friday.\u201d The Associated Press listened by phone from Honolulu.",
      "He said he felt thankful. He thanked his supporters, the judge and even prosecutors who stipulated to certain facts in the case.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to go see my mom,\u201d Cordeiro said. \u201cWould be nice.\u201d",
      "Asked about adjusting to life as a free man after 30 years behind bars, he said, \u201cI got good support.\u201d",
      "According to court documents filed by Cordeiro\u2019s attorneys, he was wrongfully convicted in part because police relied upon four jailhouse informants motivated by promises of reduced sentences and fabricated murder-for-hire plots.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately for Cordeiro, the State\u2019s use of incentivized jailhouse informants and their fabricated evidence and testimony about the murder-for-hire plots, was enough to convince a jury of his guilt in his second trial,\u201d the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court filing.",
      "However the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to show that the state intentionally used false testimony and rejected a claim of prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "Cordeiro had several alibis for the day Blaisdell was killed, his attorneys said: The then-22-year-old was at home with his parents and sisters, spending the day building a shelving unit in his family\u2019s open-air garage and installing a stereo in his sister\u2019s car \u2014 nowhere near the so-called Skid Row area in upcountry Maui where the killing happened.",
      "Blaisdell had gone to Skid Row with a man named Michael Freitas and planned to buy a pound of marijuana with $800 in cash, according to court documents. His body was found at the bottom of a ravine.",
      "Freitas kept changing his story, Cordeiro\u2019s attorneys said, and he shifted the blame onto their client, a friend who he falsely believed had \u201csnitched\u201d on him in an unrelated drug case.",
      "After Cordeiro\u2019s conviction, new testing on physical evidence from the scene excluded him as the source of DNA on Blaisdell\u2019s body and other crime scene evidence, the Hawaii Innocence Project said, and a a DNA profile of an unidentified person was found on the inside pockets of Blaisdell\u2019s jeans.",
      "The judge agreed that the new DNA evidence and new information about gunshot residue would change the results of a later trial.",
      "Cordeiro\u2019s attorneys believe Freitas, who died in 2020, set Blaisdell up to be robbed and was involved in his killing.",
      "\u201cThe police botched this case from the beginning and turned the No. 1 suspect into the state\u2019s star witness, resulting in a 30-plus-year nightmare and miscarriage of justice for Gordon and his family,\u201d Lawson said."

      "Los Angeles' top prosecutor rejected a bid by Erik and Lyle Menendez to challenge their murder convictions, telling reporters Friday that evidence cited by the brothers did not meet the standards required for a judge to order a new trial.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said prosecutors had filed a response Friday opposing a petition filed by the brothers in May 2023 that sought a new trial.",
      "A letter that the brothers' lawyer has previously described as a critical piece of evidence in the petition \u2014 he said it confirms Erik\u2019s account that his father was sexually molesting him in the months before the 1989 murders \u2014 did not appear credible, Hochman said.",
      "The brothers have described the killings at their Beverly Hills home on the night of Aug. 20, 1989, as self-defense. They said they fatally shot their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, after Lyle confronted their father about his ongoing abuse of Erik and threatened to expose the entertainment company executive.",
      "Lyle has said his father responded with what he viewed as a threat.",
      "In the petition, Erik said he wrote the letter to his cousin in December 1988, nine months before the murders. But the document, Hochman said, is an undated photocopy.",
      "\"We've asked for the original copy,\" he said. \"We've not been presented with an original or an envelope with a postmark.\"",
      "Hochman added that Erik and the cousin testified about Erik's abuse at trial and both said the last time they spoke about it was six years before the murders, Hochman said.",
      "He said it was \"inconceivable\" and \"defies common sense\" to believe that they discussed the abuse without raising the matter at trial.",
      "\"If they had evidence that sex abuse had been communicated not just six years before the events, but nine months before the 1989 killings, it would absolutely have come out during one or both of the testimonies,\" Hochman said.",
      "The cousin, Hochman said, could not confirm the letter's authenticity because he died in 2003.",
      "Another piece of possible evidence included in the petition is a declaration from Roy Rossell\u00f3, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. In the document, Rossello alleged that Jose Menendez \u2014 who was then working for RCA, the band\u2019s record label \u2014 sexually assaulted him while the band was in the United States.",
      "The claims were the subject of a 2023 Peacock series, \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed.\u201d",
      "But in Friday's court filing,\u00a0prosecutors argued that the claim was \u201cinadmissible, immaterial and lacks credibility.\u201d",
      "Citing the California Court of Appeal, they noted \u201cthe trial court stated the principal issue was the state of mind of the defendants at the time of the killing and the relevant prior incident may have had on the defendants.\u201d",
      "The Menendez brothers did not learn of Rossello\u2019s allegations until more than three decades after the murders, making the evidence inadmissible, the filing states.",
      "In a statement Friday, family members of Erik and Lyle who are pushing for the brothers' release said they were \"profoundly disappointed\" by the prosecutor's comments, which they said \"effectively tore up new evidence and discredited the trauma they experienced.\"",
      "\"He is not just dismissing Erik and Lyle\u2019s experiences, he is silencing survivors everywhere who know what it\u2019s like to be disbelieved, ignored, and retraumatized by a system designed to protect them.\"",
      "Prosecutors have previously disputed the brothers\u2019 abuse claims, calling them false and saying the killings were cold-blooded and financially motivated.",
      "Both brothers testified about the alleged abuse at their televised trial in 1993. When a jury could not reach a unanimous verdict, a judge declared a mistrial. During their 1995 retrial, Lyle did not testify and the judge \u2014 citing a ruling from California\u2019s high court \u2014 barred them from claiming self-defense.",
      "The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "Last October, former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said he supported a request to resentence the brothers to 50 years to life in prison, a move that could make them eligible for parole immediately if approved by a judge.",
      "Hochman said Friday that his office is still reviewing the request but he expects to make a decision in the next two weeks. A two-day hearing on matter is scheduled for March.",
      "In an interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n acknowledged that their crimes were brutal and premeditated but said the brothers have been \u201cexceptional prisoners\u201d while incarcerated and no longer pose a public safety risk.",
      "Many of the brothers\u2019 relatives have publicly supported Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s efforts, with one saying at an October news conference that their family stands \u201cunited in hope and gratitude.\u201d",
      "Kitty\u2019s brother, Milton Andersen, has opposed their release. In a letter to Gasc\u00f3n, a lawyer for Andersen said the brothers\u2019 motive in the killing was \u201cpure greed.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n also said he supports clemency for the brothers, which would be granted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom has not yet weighed in on the matter."

      "The Spirit Awards, held in a beachside tent in Santa Monica, California, is the shaggier, more irreverent sister to the Academy Awards, celebrating the best in independent film and television.",
      "Host Aidy Bryant called it \u201cHollywood\u2019s third or fourth biggest night.\u201d",
      "In accepting the directing prize, Baker spoke passionately about the difficulty of making independent films in an industry that is no longer able to fund riskier films. He said indies are in danger of becoming calling card films \u2014 movies made only as a means to get hired for bigger projects.",
      "\u201cThe system has to change because this is simply unsustainable,\u201d Baker said to enthusiastic applause. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be barely getting by.\u201d",

      "Culkin was not there to accept \u2014 he also missed his BAFTA win last weekend to tend to a family member \u2014 but other\u00a0Oscar nominees\u00a0like Madison and Demi Moore were.",

Acting categories for the Spirit Awards are gender neutral and include 10 spots each, meaning Madison and Moore were up against Oscar nominees like Colman Domingo (\u201cSing Sing\u201d) and Sebastian Stan (\u201cThe Apprentice\u201d).",

The awards limit eligibility to productions with budgets of $30 million or less, meaning more expensive Oscar nominees like\u00a0\u201cWicked\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cDune: Part Two\u201d\u00a0were not in the running.",

      "President Donald Trump's newly-confirmed FBI director, Kash Patel, is expected to take on another top law enforcement role in the administration as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a White House official and two other sources familiar with the plan.",
      "Patel's appointment could be made official as soon as next week with a swearing-in ceremony, the sources said.",
      "The ATF, a law enforcement agency housed in the Department of Justice, is responsible for enforcing federal laws regarding the illegal use, sale and trafficking of firearms and explosives, as well as the illegal diversion of alcohol and tobacco products.",
      "It has been a frequent target of Republican lawmakers who perceive the agency as infringing on the Second Amendment, particularly as former President Joe Biden empowered it to regulate the sale of \"ghost guns\" and close a loophole that eased the process of buying a firearm.",
      "Trump earlier this month signed an executive order to \u201chalt existing policies designed to curtail the clear right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms.\u201d A White House release on that order accused the ATF of unfairly targeting gun owners.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration has flagrantly sought to eliminate Second Amendment rights. Among other infringements, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) was weaponized to end the livelihoods of law-abiding small business owners in an effort to limit Americans\u2019 ability to acquire firearms,\u201d the White House release stated.",
      "In January, Rep. Lauren Bobert, R-Colo., and Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., led several House Republicans in introducing legislation that would abolish the agency completely.",
      "\u201cI cannot imagine under any circumstance or administration where the ATF serves as an ally to the Second Amendment and law-abiding firearm owners across America,\" Boebert said in a statement.",
      "The agency's director under Biden, Steven Dettelback, was its first permanent leader since 2015, after prior administrations were unable to get a nominee confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi last week fired the chief counsel of ATF, Pamela Hicks, after three years of service, according to a LinkedIn post shared by Hicks.",
      "Bondi said, without evidence, that Hicks was among the leaders at the Department of Justice who were weaponizing the agency.",
      "\u201cThese people were targeting gun owners. Not gonna happen under this administration,\u201d Bondi said in an interview with Fox News.",
      "Patel, a Trump loyalist, was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Thursday to lead the FBI. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, joined all Democrats in opposing Patel's nomination."

      "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 In a speech that amounted to an attempted post-inauguration victory lap, Donald Trump on Saturday hyped his first four weeks in office, even as much of his agenda is bogged down in court fights and has Republicans facing pushback in their districts.",
      "Trump spent more than an hour addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, his first major rally-style address since formally being sworn in to office on Jan. 20.",
      "The first weeks of Trump\u2019s administration have overwhelmingly been defined by swift action to reduce the federal workforce and slash the size of government, an effort led by the Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Many of DOGE\u2019s actions have been at least temporarily halted by courts, including by Trump-appointed judges, but he used his CPAC speech to frame his first few weeks in office as an unchallenged victory.",
      "\u201cWelcome back to the nation\u2019s capital, where our movement is thriving, fighting, winning and dominating Washington like never before,\u201d Trump told the packed conference hall at Gaylord National just outside of Washington.",
      "Trump has scored some legal victories as he attempts to quickly reshape the federal government at a breakneck pace, but his early attempts to fulfill campaign promises for his MAGA base have been bogged down by skeptical judges.",
      "In his speech at the conference, however, Trump ignored his early administration losses and framed even what were clear legal setbacks as victories.",
      "\u201cI signed an order that will end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens,\u201d Trump told the crowd to loud applause.",
      "On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined the Justice Department\u2019s emergency request to implement Trump\u2019s executive order limiting birthright citizenship, which extends citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of underlying immigration status.",
      "Despite constitutional concerns, removing birthright citizenship was among Trump\u2019s top focuses on the campaign trail.",
      "A federal court also blocked Musk and DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, housed in the U.S. Treasury, something that sparked widespread concern from Democrats, some Republicans and government watchdogs.",
      "In his first major political speech since his inauguration, though, Trump ignored this series of losses.",
      "\u201cWe want the government smaller, more efficient,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want to keep the best people, and we are not going\u00a0to keep the worst people. \u2026 If they don\u2019t report for work, we are firing them.\u201d",
      "Trump, without question, has used DOGE to take the most fast-paced action to shred federal government infrastructure in the history of the nation. There have been mass layoffs across several federal agencies, in some cases necessitating reversals when key personnel were accidentally let go.",
      "The most notable was the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to un-fire dozens of National Nuclear Security Administration staffers, most of whom were responsible for the critical task of overseeing the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile.",
      "Trump also doubled down on his controversial economic policies that lean heavily on imposing tariffs on countries he perceives as attempting to take advantage of the United States. Trump has pushed to implement 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and 25% duties on steel and aluminum imports, plus a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, which has so far been suspended until at least the first week of March.",
      "\u201cWe were very rich because of tariffs,\u201d Trump told the CPAC crowd of the early 1900s, which he often romanticizes because it was a period marked by higher tariffs than have been implemented in modern times.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy focus has gotten pushback from many in the business community, most recently from hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen, who also owns the New York Mets.",
      "\u201cTariffs cannot be positive, OK? I mean, it\u2019s a tax,\u201d he said Friday at the FII Priority Summit in Miami Beach.",
      "Trump also continued to boast about his administration\u2019s deportation numbers, a key part of an immigration agenda that he promoted heavily during the 2024 campaign. He has deployed active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, terminated temporary protected status for Haitian immigrants and taken steps to pause the nation\u2019s amnesty process.",
      "During his CPAC address, Trump said his administration has ushered in the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history.\u201d",
      "The claim comes the day after Trump removed Caleb Vitello as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement as Trump and border czar Tom Homan have openly expressed anger about the number of people being deported, arguing the figures should be higher to align with Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s driving him nuts,\u201d a person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking told NBC News earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019re not deporting more people.\u201d"

      "A chapter representing National Treasury Employees Union members who work for the FDA's headquarters \"strongly\" advised members not to respond, adding that the NTEU and its office of general counsel are \"taking immediate action.\"",

Agencies will determine any next steps,\u201d Pineover wrote.",
      "The email comes as Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency attempt to make sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, including mass federal layoffs, the accidental firing of Department of Agriculture officials who were working on the government\u2019s response to the bird flu, and the attempts at dismantling of agencies such as USAID.",

      "\"Yeah, thank you,\" she replied as Dickinson smiled.",
      "At the end of the date, Dimoldenberg tried to drink an entire glass of milk as Dickinson watched (similar to how his \"Babygirl\" character watched Nicole Kidman down the same beverage in their steamy film), but instead of her gulping down the drink, they just kept laughing at how nervous she was to do it.",
      "\"Do you want to do this again sometime?\" she asked the \"Babygirl\" actor.",

Maybe some people might think that is really deluded,\u201d she said. \u201cI think part of me honestly believes, like, I am actually trying to meet someone and fall in love.

      "\u201cA Different World\u201d premiered on Sept. 24, 1987, and followed Denise Huxtable's (Lisa Bonet) time at Hillman College, a historically Black school. Bonet had played Denise, Cliff and Clair Huxtable\u2019s second-eldest child, for three seasons on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d before that point.",
      "Heading into the spinoff, young audiences had fallen in love with Denise\u2019s sense of style and independent, popular, \u201cwild child\u201d energy. \u201cA Different World,\u201d like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d was developed by Bill Cosby.",
      "Throughout the early seasons of \u201cA Different World,\u201d the Huxtable family made several appearances on the show, including Cliff (Cosby), Clair (Phylicia Rashad) and Denise\u2019s siblings, Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam) and Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner).",
      "Denise starts Season One rooming with a white student, Maggie Lauten (Marisa Tomei), and an older divorced student, Jaleesa Vinson.",
      "The original idea for \u201cA Different World\u201d didn\u2019t involve Denise in the starring role. Jay Sandrich, who worked on \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and directed one of the first episodes of \u201cA Different World,\u201d said in a 2001 interview with the Television Academy Foundation that the premise started with Cosby\u2019s idea of following a white student at an HBCU. Denise was still set to be the student\u2019s roommate, but the show would follow \u201cwhat\u2019s it like to be a white girl in a Black surrounding,\u201d he said.",
      "The idea was that the student was attending Hillman because Lena Horne was teaching an acting class.",
      "\u201cWe had preliminary casting,\u201d Sandrich said. \u201cAnd the casting director sent a girl from Los Angeles to meet us, who was going to be the roommate. The script hadn\u2019t been written yet. And we met with her, and we all fell in love with her because her name was Meg Ryan.\u201d",
      "Sandrich said Ryan\u2019s agents then decided \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t go into television.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarisa Tomei came in, and she was wonderful,\u201d Sandrich said.",
      "Horne ended up not joining the show, and during production the premise changed to follow Denise.",
      "\"A Different World\" originally spotlighted Denise, Maggie and Jaleesa's experiences as roommates.",
      "But after Season One, Bonet announced her pregnancy with then-husband Lenny Kravitz. They welcomed daughter Zoe Kravitz in December 1988.",
      "Debbie Allen, who started as a producer on \"A Different World\" in Season Two, said after Bonet told her about her pregnancy, they told Cosby the news together. Allen said she also wanted to write the pregnancy into the show.",
      "\"I got put in place as the new person in charge, we started talking about stories and then immediately, maybe about two or three weeks later, he says, 'You know what, Debbie. No. She's pregnant. Denise Huxtable is not pregnant,'\" Allen said in a 2011 interview with the Television Academy Foundation.",
      "Bonet then left the show, but she went back to \"The Cosby Show\" starting with its fifth season. She continued to appear on the sitcom until Season Seven.",
      "Similarly, Tomei's character was written off. Tomei said on TODAY in 2024 that she \u201chad a really good time on (\u2018A Different World\u2019), other than my unforgivable haircut.\u201d",
      "In the 2001 interview, Sandrich said the show's writers \u201cdidn\u2019t quite know how to write for Marisa.\u201d Allen said in her interview she was \"excited\" by the prospect of telling stories for Maggie. \"But we didn't get to do that,\" she said.",
      "Starting with Season Two, Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison) and Whitley Gilbert (Jasmine Guy) stepped more into the spotlight, and their love story became one of the main drivers of the show, though the sitcom is remembered as an ensemble effort.",
      "Cree Summer and Charnele Brown were also brought on as free spirit and activist Freddie Brooks and studious premed student Kim Reese, respectively.",
      "\u201cI think that was one of the real sacred keys about 'A Different World,' was that we represented all these different facets of young Black life that we had never seen before,\u201d\u00a0Summer told TODAY in 2024.",
      "While Sandrich and some \"Cosby Show\" writers developed the first few episodes of \"A Different World,\" they largely went back to working on the flagship sitcom after.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t really find its own voice for about two or three years until Debbie Allen came in,\u201d Sandrich said. \u201cIt became a different show.\u201d",
      "Allen joined the show in Season Two and has been described as its chief creative force.",
      "\"When I came on, they were like, 'Debbie, fix this. Make it relevant. Make it more real,'\" Allen said in the 2011 interview.",
      "Each episode of \u201cA Different World\u201d opened with a memorable theme song that fans of the show will never forget. The jazzy, upbeat track opened with the lyrics, \u201cI know my parents love me ...\u201d",
      "The song was composed and co-written by Lewis. The actor told Vulture in 2018 that she was also supposed to perform the song for the opening credits.",
      "\u201cIt was decided that would not be appropriate to have me sing the song 'cause it wasn\u2019t my show,\" she said. \"It was Lisa Bonet\u2019s show and they thought it would have put too much attention on me as the singer, composer, and co-star of the show. So they started looking for other options.\"",
      "Phoebe Snow sang the theme song for Season One. To switch things up for the sophomore season, none other than Aretha Franklin performed the song for the opening credits.",
      "Allen said booking Franklin started with a simple phone call.",
      "\u201cI wanted her, everybody did,\" Allen told Vulture. \"... she came all the way to California (from Detroit) and went into the recording studio and re-did that song for us and it became the iconic image of\u00a0'A Different World.'\"",
      "Franklin's version played in the opening titles for Seasons Two through Five.",
      "\u201cThey got Aretha Franklin thinking that for the next season they would have somebody else do it. Well, once Aretha recorded it, it was like, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re not having anybody else do this song,\u2019\u201d Lewis told Vulture.",
      "Of note, Season Six\u2019s version was performed by Boyz II Men.",
      "The cast of \"A Different World\" reunited on TODAY in 2024 to celebrate the show's lasting impact. When asked about the most memorable episode, the answer was unanimous: When Dwayne interrupted Whitley's wedding at the end of Season Five and professed his love for her.",
      "But the show also tackled heavy topics like racism, sexual assault, apartheid and more.",
      "For example, in one Season Five episode, Ron and Dwayne were involved in a fight with three white students from a rival college after a football game. Each character gave their account of what happened, gradually revealing the tense race relations at the origin of the fight.",
      "\"Addressing date rape and AIDS and war and gun violence and homelessness. But also, we were able to do that and make you laugh at the same time,\" Darryl M. Bell told TODAY.",
      "Another memorable episode of \"A Different World\" came in Season Four, starring Whoopi Goldberg as a professor who tasked the students with writing their own eulogies. One student, played by Tisha Campbell, read aloud her assignment and revealed that she was HIV positive.",
      "The episode, titled \"If I Should Die Before I Wake,\" aired in April 1991. \u201cI fought for a year to get that done,\u201d Allen told Entertainment Weekly that year.",
      "\"You would have thought we put Jesus Christ back on the cross the way (sighs) advertisers pulled out,\" she later told the Television Academy Foundation.",
      "Allen said the \"network was just furious\" and recalled NBC executive Warren Littlefield \"screaming\" at her.",
      "\"I don't know how, but it became our highest-rated episode, even without advertising support. That Whoopi was there, they knew something was up, everybody,\" Allen said in the 2011 interview.",
      "In addition to entertaining audiences, the show is also credited with increasing enrollment at HBCUs, as the series drew from real experiences at historically Black colleges and universities.",
      "A 1996 report from the National Center for Education Statistics found that enrollment at HBCUs increased by 26% between 1976 and 1994, \"but virtually all of the increase occurred between 1986 and 1994.\" (\u201cA Different World\u201d was on the air from 1987 to 1993.)",
      "\u201cEvery day, someone will say, 'I went to an HBCU because I watched \u2018A Different World.' I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm an engineer because I watched 'A Different World,'\" Bell told TODAY in 2024. \"It's the most rewarding part of the work we've done.\"",
      "Hillman College is a fictional school set in Virginia. (The show filmed some shots of Hillman's buildings at real HBCUs, including Clark Atlanta University and Spelman College, according to Netflix's Tudum.)",
      "Allen has said that Howard University, her alma mater, was also part of the  \"blueprint\" for \"A Different World.\"",
      "While Hillman College isn't real, the online space known as HillmanTok University is. Per NBC News, the online community started when a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University professor posted a welcome message to TikTok intended for her Introduction to African American Studies students.",
      "But Leah Barlow\u2019s video went viral, and it inspired more educators to share what they teach via TikTok. \"Enrollees\" can access a course catalog for 2025 at HillmanTok University's website.",
      "To celebrate the show's legacy, the cast of \"A Different World\" reunited for a massive tour of HBCUs across the United States in 2024. The tour aimed to increase awareness about HBCUs, connect with new audiences and raise funds for scholarships.",
      "The tour included stops at Howard, Spelman, Morehouse, Bowie State University and more.",
      "2024 proved to be a big year for \"A Different World.\" In addition to the tour, several outlets reported in August that a sequel series was in the works at Netflix and would reportedly focus on Whitley and Dwayne's daughter as she studies at Hillman.",
      "Netflix declined to comment at the time."

      "Should you take a break from dating before searching for your soulmate on \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d?",
      "It's a question that's causing conflict for one couple in the latest season of the hit Netflix series.",
      "After getting engaged sight unseen, David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien jet away on a romantic getaway to Honduras. While enjoying a relaxing boat ride, the couple have a conversation about O'Brien's dating history.",
      "Bettenburg says he knows two of his fianc\u00e9's exes, but she insists that said exes were never official boyfriends. Still, Bettenburg has a hard time reconciling the fact that O'Brien was recently talking to another guy before appearing on the show.",
      "What went down during their conversation and what does a therapist have to say about the awkward interaction? We're breaking it all down below.",
      "Lauren and Dave's conversation about exes",
      "In a confessional interview, O\u2019Brien shares her side of the story.",
      "\u201cI was talking to someone a couple of months ago, but I wouldn\u2019t have said that I dated him. Dave has mutual friends with him. And then one of my really good friends lives with the guy that I used to date. So I was giving (Dave) names and he was like, \u2018Oh I know him. I see him at the pool all the time,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Back on the boat, Bettenburg asserts that it\u2019s \u201ca little weird\u201d that he knows O\u2019Brien\u2019s exes.",
      "\u201cYou know of them,\u201c she clarifies.",
      "\u201cRight and I don\u2019t want that to affect our relationship when we go back (home),\u201d he says.",
      "O\u2019Brien is curious to know why Bettenburg is feeling this way.",
      "\u201cIs any of it like because you know them you're like, \u2018Ok why was she into them and into me?\u2019 Or like \u2018What\u2019s similar or different about us?\u2019\u201d she asks.",
      "Bettenburg reassures O'Brien that he understands she's been \u201cattracted to a lot of different types of people\u201d then explains what's bothering him.",
      "\u201cI asked you if you were seeing anyone right before the experiment started. Hearing that, I was kind of like, \u2018Ok,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "O'Brien then notes that it took \u201cmonths\u201d to learn if she was selected to appear on \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d and she didn't feel like putting her life on hold while waiting.",
      "\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018If things progress with this person, there's no reason for me to go try to find a fianc\u00e9 and a husband.\u2019 The more time that I kind of casually spent with him, the more it solidified that I was like, \u2018I'm not really invested in this relationship,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "O'Brien goes on to say she knew this other guy wasn't \u201cher person\u201d and \u201cwas never a boyfriend.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe never met any of my friends. I never met any of his friends. It really was very casual,\u201d she says.",
      "Bettenburg listened before explaining why he's feeling conflicted.",
      "\u201cIt was just different because I haven't had a girlfriend in like, four years. I've dated, but not seriously or anything. So, for me coming into this, I kind of thought everybody was going to be similar to that, like they really haven\u2019t had a good time dating,\u201d he says.",
      "In a confessional interview, Bettenburg elaborates on his feelings, saying, \u201cI think my head is more at like, \u2018How do you go from seeing someone so recently to like I'm ready for a marriage?\u2019 That just seems like a huge step in between.\u201d",
      "The topic looms heavy on the couple's budding relationship as they move in together and meet each other's inner circle. O'Brien's friends even reassure Bettenburg that the guy Lauren was recently talking to wasn't her official boyfriend.",
      "A psychologist weighs in",
      "Since marriage is the end goal of the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating experiment, the question remains: Was Bettenburg justified in worrying that O'Brien might not be ready to settle down?",
      "TODAY.com consulted Kelsey Latimer, a licensed psychologist and the founder and owner of\u00a0KML Psychological Services, to get her thoughts.",
      "\u201cAs a psychologist, I can certainly see why someone in Dave\u2019s position would express concern, given that that he was quite explicit in his question of asking about prior relationships and felt that he did not get a clear answer from his partner,\u201d Latimer says.",
      "In any relationship, the psychologist recommends paying attention to any potential red flags and trusting your instincts. At the same time, she also suggests maintaining a \u201cflexible point of view.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis means being open to hearing why someone didn\u2019t say something about a prior relationship, as it is quite possible that it was not an omission of information or lie, but rather that the individual really did not see a casual dating experience as a relationship,\" she says.",
      "Much like relationships, the answer is a bit complicated.",
      "\u201cIn the real world setting, people date all the time before they meet \u2018the one,\u2019 so it is not an odd thing.\u00a0The thing that is different here is that the people going on the show are essentially saying to themselves, \u2018I am going to find my partner in this space.\u2019 So continuing to date outside of that space probably should be further thought through,\u201d Latimer says.",
      "The psychologist notes that taking a break from dating before filming \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d is a \u201csolid\u201d idea.",
      "\u201cHaving space away from dating could easily provide a clear head for really thinking about oneself and being in touch with the serious emotions that are likely to build as the experiment begins.\u00a0Dating in the meantime could easily be seen as a distraction,\u201d Latimer notes.",
      "At the end of the day, everyone is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all approach to preparing to participate in \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are certainly scenarios where there may be no necessary reason to take space before going back to the dating world, especially if the dating relationship was casual and the breakup was mutual with no strong feelings,\" Latimer says. \u201cHowever, I would say that having space in between a serious relationship and potential new relationship is often quite important.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Belle Gibson, the Australian wellness influencer whose story \"Apple Cider Vinegar\" is based on, will always remember the moment her doctor told her she was dying.",
      "At least, that\u2019s what the former wellness influencer wrote in her 2014 book, \u201cThe Whole Pantry,\u201d which was later pulled from publication for containing fabricated claims.",
      "\u201cHe called me in and said, \u2018You have malignant brain cancer, Belle. You\u2019re dying. You have six weeks. Four months, tops,\u2019\u201d Gibson wrote. \u201cI remember a suffocating, choking feeling and then not much else.\u201d",
      "A heartbreaking diagnosis, to be sure, and also a complete lie \u2014 because Gibson, 33, was in fact never diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, despite what she told her fans for years about her illness.",
      "A new six-part Netflix miniseries, \u201cApple Cider Vinegar,\u201d takes a deep dive into Gibson\u2019s journey from wellness guru to disgraced fraudster.",
      "The is billed as a \u201ctrue-ish story based on a lie\" and is inspired by a 2017 book, \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d by two investigative journalists, Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano, who explored Gibson\u2019s deception.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Kaitlyn Dever, who plays a character named Belle Gibson in the show, says she wouldn\u2019t want to ask the real Gibson any questions if she had the chance.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any questions for her. I appreciate the approach to the show it was really to create our own versions of the character. During shooting we\u2019d refer to her as \u2018our\u2019 Belle. That was all I was really focusing on \u2014 creating who our Belle was with (series creator) Sam Strauss,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI learned about the wellness world going into this. I studied the text so that I knew it like the back of my hand. Tried to get the Australian accent down. Those were my priorities, and then also adding the human emotions to her. Why she lied and why she did this horrible thing,\u201d Dever continues.",
      "In the years since her lies were revealed, Gibson\u2019s story has taken some unexpected twists. Keep reading to learn more about the real Belle Gibson and what she has said about her actions.",
      "Who is Belle Gibson?",
      "Gibson is a former Australian social media influencer who pretended to have brain cancer, and said she had cured her cancer using a variety of natural methods.",
      "She amassed an Instagram following beginning in 2013 when she opened up about supposed terminal illness and her \u201cquest to heal myself naturally.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to share what I had learnt about health and nutrition on my journey with cancer,\u201d she wrote in her 2014 book, according to a passage shared in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson said she was \u201ctotally overwhelmed\u201d by the positive response to her posts, which inspired her to launch The Whole Pantry app, a collection of healthy recipes and lifestyle guides.",
      "She leveraged the success of the app to build a wider Whole Pantry wellness brand, which included cookbook deals in Australia, the U.K and the U.S. The young influencer earned \u201chalf a million dollars in less than two years\u201d from the brand, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "She also got glowing press coverage, as a News.com.au article from 2014 exemplifies: \"IF anyone bragged they were a game changer, odds are you\u2019d call them up themselves. But coming from Belle Gibson, it\u2019s pure truth. Gibson is a 26-year-old with many more labels \u2014 young mum, cancer survivor, wellness warrior and social media sensation having created a global online community with her app The Whole Pantry.\"",
      "As her profile grew, Gibson continued to share updates about her health, including one 2014 Instagram post claiming that her brain cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, brain, uterus and liver,\u00a0 according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d Her post drew thousands of sympathetic comments from fans.",
      "Gibson\u2019s popularity seemed unstoppable until 2015, when she was contacted by Donelly and Toscano, journalists from the Australian newspaper The Age who had some questions about her cancer claims.",
      "They had received a tip that Gibson was lying about her disease. Donelly and Toscano were unable to access Gibson\u2019s medical records to verify this claim, but they continued to investigate.",
      "\u201cWe asked ourselves, If she\u2019s lying about this, what else would she lie about?\u201d they wrote in their book.",
      "So they looked into Gibson\u2019s finances, and began to question whether Gibson had lied about her philanthropy. They wondered if the influencer was really donating large portions of her profits to various charities, as she publicly said.",
      "It turned out she was not, and the uncovering of these financial lies marked the beginning of the end for the influencer. After Donelly and Toscano published their reporting on Gibson\u2019s lack of charitable donations, supporters began turning against her and questioning other statements she had made about her health.",
      "The professional fallout for Gibson was swift. Penguin Australia canceled her new \u201cThe Whole Pantry\u201d cookbook and acknowledged it had not fact-checked Gibson\u2019s claims about her illness and fundraising activities.",
      "By March 2015, The Whole Pantry app had also been dropped from all Apple platforms, Donelly and Toscano reported for The Sydney Morning Herald in 2017.",
      "After Gibson was exposed, many of her former supporters shared their anger about her deception on social media. Some accused Gibson of causing real harm to people with cancer by encouraging them to pursue alternative treatment in lieu of traditional medical interventions.",
      "\u201cYour story creates a false hope which causes patients to abandon therapies with demonstrated efficacy in favour of ridiculous and dangerous placebo treatments,\u201d Lester Pepingco, a doctor based in Sydney, Australia, wrote in an open letter to Gibson, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Does she have a partner and a son, like in the show?",
      "In the show, Belle is in a long-term relationship with Clive Rothwell and she has a young son from a previous relationship.",
      "Clive Rothwell is a real person and he and Gibson were previously together, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d It is unclear whether they are still a couple, as Gibson has not spoken publicly about her personal life in recent years.",
      "In a 2019 court hearing, Gibson described Rothwell as her housemate and friend, per The Guardian.",
      "The real Gibson does have a son, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "What has Belle Gibson said about her actions?",
      "Gibson admitted to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s The Weekly in 2015.",
      "\u201cNone of it\u2019s true,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She also said it was \u201cvery scary\u201d to confront the reality that she is not terminally ill.",
      "\u201cBecause you start to doubt the crux of things that make up who you are. You know, I\u2019m blonde and I\u2019m tall, and I\u2019ve got hazel eyes and I\u2019ve got cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, you take away some of those high-level things and it\u2019s really daunting.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t want forgiveness, and said she felt speaking out \u201cwas the responsible thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove anything, I would like people to say, \u2018OK, she\u2019s human. She\u2019s obviously had a big life. She\u2019s respectfully come to the table and said what she\u2019s needed to say, and now it\u2019s time for her to grow and heal,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In an interview a few months later with 60 Minutes Australia, Gibson claimed she had once genuinely believed she had brain cancer.",
      "She told interviewer Tara Brown that in 2015, she met a man called Mark Johns who told her he was an immunologist and neurologist.  60 Minutes Australia said they could not find evidence of a man named Mark Johns existing.",
      "\u201cHe had come to my home and went through a series of tests and this was dubbed \u2018integrative medicine,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "She said John tested her with \u201ca machine with lights on the front and that machine was apparently German technology\u201d and diagnosed her with cancer.",
      "\u201cHe said to me that I had a Stage 4 brain tumor and that I had approximately four months to live,\u201d she told Brown.",
      "Brown asked Gibson why she had claimed in her 2014 book that she had been diagnosed with cancer in a doctor\u2019s office, which is a different story.",
      "\u201cI think that being open in telling people the way that it happened would not be understood, and that people would be disappointed or angry for me not following what is the right way to go about this,\u201d Gibson replied.",
      "Gibson also said she \u201cbelieved (Johns) was a real doctor\u201d and believed she had been treated for cancer.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I believed I was having radiotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he gave me medication, I was told that it was oral chemotherapy, and I believed it.\u201d",
      "She said that when she learned she had never had cancer, she was devastated.",
      "\u201c(Once) I received the definitive, \u2018No, you do not have cancer,\u2019 then that was something I had to come to terms with,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat takes a lot, and it was really traumatizing and I was feeling a huge amount of grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrief for not having cancer?\u201d Brown asked her.",
      "\u201cNo, that I had been lied to, that I felt like I had been taken for a ride,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt took me a lot to unpack that. And once I was strong enough, I was ready to come out to speak with my community about it.\u201d",
      "Belle Gibson's interview video can be still viewed",
      "Segments of the real Gibson's interview with 60 Minutes Australia live on YouTube.",
      "In one clip, Gibson denies being a pathological liar and says she \"never intended\" on dissuading people from pursuing conventional cancer treatments.",
      "When asked how old she is, Gibson responds, \"I've always been raised as being currently a 26-year-old.\"",
      "When pressed by interviewer Brown, she responds, \"I live knowing, as I've always known, that I would be 26. I believe that I am 26.\"",
      "What legal consequences has she faced?",
      "In April 2017, the Federal Court of Australia issued a court order to Gibson and her company.",
      "The order declared that Gibson had engaged in \u201cmisleading or deceptive\u201d business conduct in violation of Australian Consumer Law when she stated she had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009, claimed she had four months to live, and claimed she \u201chad taken and then rejected conventional cancer treatments in favor of embarking on a quest to heal herself naturally.\u201d",
      "The court document also stated that Gibson\u2019s company had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by claiming that a \u201clarge part\u201d of earnings from the Whole Pantry app would be given to charities or good causes.",
      "In reality, less than $10,000 was donated from earnings of about $420,000, the court said.",
      "The court accused Gibson of not honoring her pledge to donate proceeds related to the Whole Pantry app to multiple non-profit organizations, including the Birthing Kit Foundation, One Girl and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.",
      "Only one of these charities, One Girl, received $1,000 from Gibson and her company, and the others \u201creceived no donation,\u201d the court said.",
      "The court order also states Gibson did not donate as promised to the family of Joshua Schwarz, a young boy with terminal brain cancer. His family had hoped \u201cto fly him to Mexico as a last resort for treatment,\u201d according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson met the Schwarz family through social media and promised to help them financially. However, the Schwarz family did not receive any of the promised funds from Gibson, according to the court order.",
      "In September 2017, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Gibson to pay $410,000 in relation to her \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d",
      "As of early 2020, Gibson had still not paid the fine, which had grown to more than half a million Australian dollars due to interest and other expenses, according to the Australian Associated Press, via The Guardian.",
      "Authorities raided Gibson\u2019s home in Melbourne in January 2020 in an attempt to seize items to sell to partially recoup her unpaid fine, the AAP reported at the time.",
      "Gibson\u2019s home was raided once again in 2021 after the fine remained unpaid.",
      "Is law enforcement pursuing Belle Gibson?",
      "In late 2023, Donelly and Toscano received another update from Consumer Affairs Victoria, which they shared in their book.",
      "A spokesperson told them the agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and said the \u201centire amount\u201d of her debt is \u201cstill outstanding.\u201d",
      "In February 2025, authorities reiterated this, noting that they are continuing to pursue Gibson for unpaid fines, per AP.",
      "Jacinta Allan, the premier of Victoria, was asked by reporters in February about the status of the case. She said Consumer Affairs Victoria \"won't let up.\"",
      "\u201cConsumer Affairs Victoria is continuing to pursue this, particularly in the context of the orders that have been made by the court,\u201d she said, per the Australian news outlet SBS News.",
      "Where is Belle Gibson now, as of 2025?",
      "A few years after her scandal, Gibson resurfaced in an unexpected way. In an interview shared on social media in 2020, she said she had been \u201cadopted\u201d by the Oromo community, an Ethiopian ethnic group in Melbourne.",
      "Wearing a traditional headscarf and using the name Sabontu, Gibson referenced \u201cour diaspora\u201d and discussed the current political situation \u201cback home\u201d in Ethiopia.",
      "When the interviewer asked Gibson what had inspired her to join the Oromo community, she called it a \u201cblessing that was given to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel completely adopted by your nation and your people, and I feel like my heart is as invested as yours and your family\u2019s,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cYour struggle is my struggle,\u201d she added.",
      "By 2021, Gibson had been disowned by the Oromo community after they learned of her history, according to an investigation by Daily Mail Australia.",
      "\u201cShe was told not to come,\u201d Tarekegn Chimdi, president of the Australian Oromo Community Association in Victoria, told the publication.",
      "\u201cIt was concerning when someone is using the community\u2019s name who is not a member of that community,\u201d Chimdi said. \u201cShe was coming across as more Oromo than Oromo people.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Chimdi for comment."

I wanted that to be completely removed from this entire situation. Hence,\u00a0'Love Is Blind.' So the thought of that very premise being compromised was terrifying to me.\u201d"

      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister's opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven't met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave's friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \"Love Is Blind.\" Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling.

In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",
      "Ben and Sara landed in Honduras and swiftly decided to build on their emotional connection by exploring a physical relationship. When all the engaged couples reunited, Ben and Sara could not stop gushing about how well they got along.",
      "In Minneapolis, Sara met a few of Ben's friends. Sara shared details about their conversation about values in the pods and his friends confirmed that he was an inclusive person.",
      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "Season 8 couples who are no longer together",
      "Alex and Madison",
      "Alex Brown and Madison Errichiello opened up in the pods about their difficult childhoods. Alex, a 29-year-old commercial real estate broker, and Madison, a 28-year-old artist, were both bullied in school and felt like outcasts.",
      "The two seemed headed for an engagement until Madison revealed she had an avoidant attachment style. Alex suddenly became less talkative and their conversation ended abruptly.",
      "When they met again, Alex voiced his concerns that Madison would run if they faced an obstacle. She told him that her still being in the experiment was proof that she was ready to go through challenging times with him. Meanwhile, Madison was also building a connection with Mason Horacen.",
      "Mason told Madison he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to her. But when Madison decided to pursue her relationship with Alex instead, Mason regretted what he said. In Episode 6, Madison explained the situation to Alex.",
      "Alex said he sympathized with Mason and wished him well. Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

      "Mason and Meg",
      "Mason, a 33-year-old cinematographer, gravitated toward Meg Fink, a 31-year-old oncology nurse, in the pods. She shared her conspiracy theories with him and expressed her strong feelings. But she knew that Mason also had a connection with Madison.",
      "After Madison ended things with Mason, she told Meg what happened. Meg confronted Mason in the pods at the end of Episode 5. She questioned if she was only there by \u201cdefault\u201d because Madison rejected him.",
      "He said he validated the \u201cwrong person\u201d because he was \u201cconfused\u201d at the time.",
      "When he said she was always his first choice, Meg replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t yesterday, just to be fair.\u201d She said he never affirmed his feelings for her until it was too late.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll never know if what you\u2019re saying is true because we don\u2019t get the opportunity for you to pick,\u201d she told him in Episode 6. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to get past that.\u201d",
      "He said he understood her perspective and they said goodbye.",

      "By the end of Episode 9, only a single Traitor remained. The episode concluded with the sole Traitor being required to present an offer to one of the remaining Faithfuls: join me or die.

      "Dorinda Medley",
      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",
      "Wells Adams",
      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

      "Chanel Ayan seemed, admittedly, unprepared for the duplicity she would face on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d Like Dorinda, she erroneously chose to get off the boat in Episode 1. Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\""

Christopher has been living in El Paso with Eddie\u2019s parents since the Season Seven finale, a period of several months. The 14-year-old left LA after walking in on Eddie having an emotionally charged moment with a woman named Kim \u2014 a dead ringer for Shannon, Christopher\u2019s mother and Eddie\u2019s wife, who died at the end of Season Two. (Both Kim and Shannon were played by Devin Kelley.)",
      "Christopher's absence has left Eddie \u2014 and Buck, Christopher\u2019s legal guardian in the event of Eddie's death \u2014 reeling throughout Season Eight.",
      "In the Nov. 21 midseason finale, Buck arrives at Eddie's house armed with scones from all the baking he's been doing to cope with the breakup with Tommy (Lou Ferrigno Jr.). As he rifles through Eddie's cabinet looking for ingredients, he notices Eddie quickly flip his tablet face down. Buck grabs it and sees that his co-worker had been looking at houses.",
      "\"Where are you going to find a place like this in LA at your price point?\" Buck asks.",
      "\"They're not in LA. They're in El Paso,\" Eddie responds.",
      "\"I'm tired of missing out on all my son's big moments before he grows up,\" Eddie later says.",
      "So, Buck plasters on a smile and offers to help look through Eddie's options. He goes to sit in Eddie's living room, and once he's alone, his smile instantly drops.",
      "Stark says the rest of Season Eight will have \"a ton of different stuff going on.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of tension in the upcoming episodes between characters that we don't often see tension between,\" he says.",
      "\"We're going to be looking at what happens when you kind of start to tug at a thread, and, you know, it keeps on pulling and pulling, and you kind of watch a lot of things unravel as that goes,\" he adds.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Stark ahead of his appearance in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game Feb. 14. The actor previewed the rest of Season Eight, from the status of his character's relationship with Christopher to the episode Stark is looking forward to the most.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "It was really tough, everything that was happening in Los Angeles. We were obviously during our workday when it started happening. And, you know, we have cast members and crew members deeply, deeply affected by it. So it's been a really emotional time.",
      "And, you know, we do make this show with the idea in mind of paying tribute to what first responders do, and this just goes to show exactly why the show is there to do that. Because it's very easy to praise and think about the impact of first responders when dealing with such a widespread, media-covered emergency, but we don't always think about them in quieter times. And so it's just a reminder that the show is there to try and make sure that that spotlight on them is constant, because they are always there at the ready.",
      "I think it's a case of a huge part of his world being taken away and, you know, something that he's placed a lot of stability on, I would think. So, realizing that the removal of that is possibly going to cause a number of things to crumble around him.",
      "I think he obviously wants to be there for Eddie and be supportive, but it's hard not to also think about yourself in that situation and what he's losing in the fight that Eddie has to go and get his son back.",
      "I think those feelings are going to be amplified as well, in especially the first episode of the season. And Buck's really going to be put into that place of feeling abandoned, and he's going to react to it in a really \u2014 and I don't say this about myself, I say this about the story \u2014 a really cute way, that I think will go down very well with viewers of the show.",
      "I guess if I was to think about it, I don't think they necessarily would have been really in contact. You know, I feel like maybe that would feel like going around Eddie, or going behind Eddie's back, maybe. Or even if Eddie was aware of it, maybe just making Eddie jealous, because Eddie can't have that relationship with him. So I think Buck has kind of not tried to intervene too much in the situation, or not insert himself into the situation, because as much as he is a part of their life, you know, that is his son, and I don't think you would want to overstep too much. So, yeah, I actually don't think that Buck is in contact with Christopher and that he's kind of letting Eddie handle his business and just being there at the ready if needed.",
      "I think we've seen \u2014\u00a0and obviously Buck is also post-breakup, you know, he has a lot of things and he seems to just kind of be running, not from them, but through them. Keeping himself busy, whether it be the baking, whether it be work \u2014\u00a0just keeping things happening so that maybe he doesn't have too much time to stop and think, which, you know, always catches up with you eventually. But I kind of feel like that's where we find Buck at the moment. He's just keeping himself occupied so that the silence and the thoughts don't creep in.",
      "I have experienced that in some of the earlier seasons. I think it was hard to quiet that noise. And then once you read one thing or another, it's difficult to not let it seep in, you know? But I've kind of found the balance, and I don't think, as an actor on the show, I don't think you should be involved in fandom of the show, and I don't think you should read fandom of the show. I think your job is your job, and you have to make the thing, and then it gets given over to the fans to do whatever they want with it. And so, actually finding that boundary between the two has been really, really healthy for me.",
      "Season Eight, this season. It's definitely a newer thing for me. But, you know, listen, anytime I'm on a social media app, and anything \"9-1-1\" or anything Oliver Stark-related comes up, I gleefully (click) \"not interested in this post\" and get it out of my algorithm. And it's really helped me just kind of think more positively about it. So, yeah, it's a newer thing, but something that I'm really happy that I made a step towards.",
      "Episode 11 I think is really special. Not even just because of story, but one of our own directed it. One of the cast directed it, which is the first time that's happened on the show. So that was a really special experience for me. Not me the director, me the actor on the show. It's not me.",
      "I think I'm really excited for that to air, just because, I just think it's a really special moment, and it's this particular actor's first time doing it. So, yeah, just, it felt like a big moment.",
      "I think so. I\u2019m pretty sure it'll be revealed ahead of time, but I think they are keeping it secret for now."

      "Kim Kardashian clapped back to the haters who criticized her daughter's \"Lion King\" performance.",
      "Kardashian's eldest daughter, North West, played Simba in a live concert at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2024, which celebrated the 30th anniversary of \"The Lion King.\"",
      "Clips of North's performance at the event went viral, showing North singing with excitement. Online, many said Disney should have selected another more conventionally trained performer to play the role of Simba.",
      "\u201cI was there. It would have been a great performance at a school talent show or musical, but with so many amazing young performers out there, she shouldn\u2019t have been on the HB stage,\u201d one\u00a0person said on TikTok.",
      "Another added, \u201cNorth West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\"",
      "Kardashian anticipated the backlash in the Season 6, Episode 3 of \u201cThe Kardashians.\"",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian said that she knew her daughter got the role because of nepotism and she knew that North would face criticism for her singing abilities.",
      "\"I already know what's coming, that she's not Whitney Houston. Duh! I know that she got the job because of her parents,\" she said.",
      "However, Kardashian explained that \"North is the moment\" and she's the one who people pay to see.",
      "\"They want to see North West on a TikTok, on a this, on anything, because she's a personality, a performer,\" she said.",
      "She shared choice words for anyone who came for her daughter's performance. \"If anyone wants to hate on a child that is having the time of their lives, then f--k you,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian said that she's \"proud\" of North. \"It's such a proud moment as a mom to see your child have so much fun and not be nervous at all,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian added, \"She's so proud of herself. She did such a great job. And anyone that is hating on a kid is just a hater, and she's not there to be Mariah Carey.\"",
      "The start of the episode looks into how North got the opportunity \u2014 and why Kardashian was hesitant to let her accept it. Disney approached the family about North's participation, according to the episode.",
      "\"I just can't decide,\" Kardashian said on the phone with her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. She said she was \"worried about\" people being mean.",
      "\"I'm really torn on if we should let her do this or not. \"She's not a singer. She raps. She's been on a stage with her dad for sure. As a mom, especially putting her child on a platform with a lot of opinions \u2014 it's something to really, really think about,\" she said.",
      "North, however, expressed her interest. \"Right away, she was like, 'Please, Mom, I want to do it,'\" Kardashian recalled her saying. She finally let her do it, saying she \"believes in her.\"",
      "The episode goes into dress rehearsals and North in costume behind-the-scenes. \"I'm so happy I'm doing this,\" North said.",
      "Kardashian also grapples with being a \"mom-ager\" to North's career. \"I'm not really ready to be a mom-ager. But if there's one thing she wants to do here or there, that makes sense, I'll consider it. I loved this for her,\" she said."

      "Francis, 88, was admitted to Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 for bronchitis. Earlier this week, the Vatican announced he had developed pneumonia in both lungs.

      "Last week, Francis was seen wearing a sling on his arm after falling in his residence. The injury was his second fall in a span of several weeks.",

Meanwhile a spate of high-profile attacks on Germany\u2019s streets, the latest coming Friday at Berlin\u2019s Holocaust memorial, have led to charged campaign debates on immigration.",
      "The favorite to become chancellor is Friedrich Merz, 69, the straight-laced, bespectacled leader of the center-right Christian Democrat Union, or CDU. He has questioned Germany\u2019s future relationship with the United States.",

      "At home, Merz wants to slash regulatory red tape and corporate taxes while tightening Germany\u2019s borders in what critics say is an attempt to ape his rivals on the hard right. He is up against incumbent Olaf Scholz, 66, whose center-left Social Democratic Union, or SPD, has struggled to cope with the twin economic crises of pandemic fallout and war in Ukraine.",

Shortly afterward, an exit poll will drop that has historically given an accurate idea of the final results. Over the coming hours, overnight into Monday morning, the results themselves will trickle in.",

      "\u201cThe AfD is not a racist or an anti-foreigner party,\u201d said Joachim Steyer, 58, a plumber turned local AfD lawmaker in the southern German town of Burladingen. \u201cBut is simply is a fact that we now have so many problems that we did not have before mass migration.\u201d",
      "Almost 40% of his region voted for the AfD in European elections last year despite the area having low levels of immigration. He said the vote is motivated by what people believe is happening in cities.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the pictures in Hamburg, Bremen, the Ruhr valley, where they populate entire cities, where you hardly see a German, and there are mosques where there is a call to prayer in the morning, I feel more like in Turkey than in Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is what people reject. We want nothing other than being German, to preserve our culture.\u201d",
      "The White House and AfD leader Weidel did not respond to requests for comment on their relationship or policies and rhetoric of the party.",
      "The AfD\u2019s rise is particularly striking in Germany, a country so wary of its own Nazi past that it has laws and informal political pacts intended to stop fascism\u2019s return. One of these is the \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2014 an agreement by parties not to work with far-right parties such as the AfD. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unlikely the party will enter any coalition following the vote, even if it polls strongly.",
      "\u201cNobody expects the AfD to form a government this election,\u201d Busch said. \u201cSo it\u2019s difficult to assess how seriously they should be taken.\u201d",
      "These attempts to rein in the AfD has become a soapbox issue for AfD lawmakers, whose rousing cries that their freedom of speech is being restricted have been echoed by Musk and others.",
      "Potential coalition options include a CDU-Green alliance. Or even a so-called \u201cGrand Coalition\u201d \u2014 or GroKo \u2014 between the CDU and SPD, the two historically largest parties right and left of center. Some see danger in this as it would anoint the AfD as the official opposition.",
      "These coalition talks can take months, and getting the wrong bedfellows can be costly. Scholz\u2019s \u201ctraffic light coalition\u201d with the Greens and Free Democrats was beset by infighting, finally imploding over a budget deficit argument in November, setting the stage for Sunday\u2019s snap poll.",
      "The idea of two rivals joining forces might seem strange to polarized American ears, but the GroKo was repeatedly employed by the imperious Merkel during her 16 years in power, and typifies the kind of moderate consensus building that drives German politics.",
      "The AfD would argue that it\u2019s exactly this kind of mainstream, establishment groupthink that got Germany and the West into the multiple crises of today.",
      "The country is undoubtedly at a low ebb. Once the industrial powerhouse of Europe, its economy sits on the brink of recession. It no longer enjoys cheap natural gas pumped into Europe by Russian President Vladimir Putin, with Western powers agreeing to stop drawing from the pariah\u2019s wellspring. And its former export market of China has become an economic competitor, challenging Germany\u2019s legacy auto industry with cheaper, great quality electric vehicles.",
      "Then there\u2019s the question of the United States, which for decades has underwritten Germany\u2019s military security by positioning American troops on German soil as a warning first to the Soviet Union and now Russia. That guarantee looks over in its current form, with President Donald Trump openly questioning the postwar security pact with NATO countries.",
      "Though a back-seat military power since World War II, Germany has upped its military budget after years of failing to meet NATO\u2019s minimum guidelines. Still, many experts say that as the world\u2019s third largest economy, it is still doing too little, and raising the defense budget further will put even more strain on its ailing economy.",
      "As Germany prepares to celebrate 70 years in the military alliance in May, Merz questioned Washington\u2019s future as its keystone member.",
      "\u201cWill the Americans still be there?\u201d he told the Darmstadt event. \u201cEight weeks ago I would not have dared to ask this question, but today we have to give an answer to it.\u201d"

      "The victim of the attack suffered \"life threatening injuries,\" according to the police, but was \"no longer in danger.\"",

      "Lately, though, Trump has publicly soured on Ukraine. Throughout the week he has treated Zelenskyy as he might a garden-variety political foe, parsing his poll numbers while depicting Ukraine as an obstacle to a peace deal.",
      "The darkening message may reflect Trump\u2019s frustration that Ukraine has resisted his call to let the U.S. tap rare earth minerals the country possesses as compensation for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has provided over the years.",

      "\u201cIn the place where I lived, they don\u2019t accept me,\u201d said Santos-Zacar\u00eda, 36.",
      "Santos-Zacar\u00eda\u2019s story gained media attention in 2023 when the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled\u00a0in her favor, giving her another chance to argue that U.S. immigration officials were wrong in rejecting her bid to fight deportation on the grounds she\u2019d face persecution in Guatemala.",
      "Santos-Zacar\u00eda has testified in public legal documents\u00a0that she was raped and threatened with death as a teenager in her native country.",
      "\u201cI was abused, I was raped, and I was only about 12 years old. I never told my family what happened to me, because if I spoke, that boy would kill me or someone in my family. The fear I had left me traumatized, and I said that the best thing to do was to leave,\u201d Santos-Zacar\u00eda said.",
      "Now, amid new Trump administration policies restricting immigration, amping up deportations and rescinding some legal pathways for immigrants and asylum-seekers to stay in the U.S.,  those arguing Santos-Zacar\u00eda\u2019s case are worried.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that with all the executive orders and political pressure, they will end up changing the asylum laws and measures such as the suspension of deportation, which is what we are fighting for,\u201d said Benjamin Osorio, Santos-Zacar\u00eda\u2019s attorney. \u201cThat would be terrible because they could expel her.\u201d",
      "Her attorney\u2019s fears persist despite recent legal victories.",
      "On Jan. 13, the\u00a0U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\u00a0ruled that Santos-Zacar\u00eda can continue to challenge an order for her deportation, or removal, to Guatemala.",
      "\u201cWe won the opportunity to continue fighting to keep her from being deported, but the case is going back to the appeals board and I think she will have to go back to immigration court,\u201d Osorio said.",
      "Despite the last ruling in her favor, President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20 and his administration has issued a series of executive orders that, among other things, have suspended the government\u2019s refugee program, mandated\u00a0federal recognition of only two sexes\u00a0(male and female) based on an \u201cimmutable biological classification,\u201d and ended the CBP One application through which many people applied for asylum appointments before entering the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that their mission is to make it much more difficult to obtain protection,\u201d said Aaron Morris, executive director of\u00a0Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for and represents LGBTQ+ people in the immigration system. \u201cAnd I think asylum, suspension of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture fall into that agenda.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo contacted U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for comment on the effects of recent executive orders on immigration processes as well as on the situation for people requesting these protections, but has not received a response. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Justice Department office that conducts deportation proceedings, declined to offer comments or an interview on the subject.",
      "After Santos-Zacar\u00eda left Guatemala, she fled to Mexico and then crossed into the U.S., but was deported in 2008. Ten years later, she returned to the U.S. \u2014 she has said she was attacked in Mexico \u2014 and was detained by immigration authorities. Since then, she\u2019s been pleading her case to stay in the U.S., arguing she wouldn\u2019t be safe if she\u2019s deported.",
      "Since Santos-Zacar\u00eda had already been deported from the U.S., she was unable to apply for asylum, but did apply for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, or CAT. In the recent Fifth Circuit ruling, the court granted Santos\u2019 request to continue fighting for withholding of removal, though it denied CAT protection.",
      "Worries over deportation to third countries",
      "\u201cIt is common for the court not to approve everything while the process continues \u2014 the people who request the suspension can have a work permit and can stay in the country,\u201d Osorio said.",
      "\u201cBut what is happening now, as we have seen in the news, is that other countries want to accept migrants of other nationalities, and that can be a big problem for these people,\u201d Osorio added, referring to the recent proposal by El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele to\u00a0accept immigrants from other countries\u00a0who are deported from the U.S.",
      "Experts consulted by Noticias Telemundo agree that current laws contemplate\u00a0deportations to third countries, including in cases of deportation suspension and CAT protection, meaning\u00a0the U.S. government can expel beneficiaries of these measures to a country other than the one where they\u2019re at risk.",
      "In the case of Santos-Zacar\u00eda, this would suggest that even if she\u2019s not sent back to Guatemala, she could be expelled to El Salvador or any other country that the authorities consider suitable.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 19:21:10 GMT",
    "summary": "French far-right leader Jordan Bardella canceled his planned CPAC remarks after Steve Bannon made a hand gesture that some said appeared to be a Nazi salute.",
    "story": [
      "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 French far-right leader Jordan Bardella on Friday canceled his planned remarks here at the Conservative Political Action Conference after Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump who is now a popular conservative podcast host, made a hand gesture that some said appeared to be a Nazi salute.",
      "\"Yesterday, while I was not present in the room, one of the speakers out of provocation allowed himself a gesture alluding to Nazi ideology,\" Bardella said in a statement to French media outlets. \"I therefore took the immediate decision to cancel my speech that had been scheduled this afternoon.\"",
      "The controversy comes a month after Elon Musk was accused of giving a Nazi salute at one of Trump's inauguration events, further embroiling conservatives in a debate about whether their leaders are intentionally paying homage to the brutal regime responsible for the systemic murder of millions of Jews in the 1940s.",
      "It's also the most recent incident at CPAC in which an attendee appeared to refer to Nazi ideology.",
      "The Bannon incident occurred Thursday, as he spoke to the crowd of conservative activists.",
      "\"The only way they win is if we retreat,\" Bannon said at the end of his speech. \"And we're not going to retreat. We're not going to surrender. We're not going to quit. Fight, fight, fight!\"",
      "He then extended his right arm.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Thursday at the conference, Bannon denied that the gesture was a salute.",
      "\"I do that all the time. I wave to my crowd, because it's all about them,\" Bannon said, saying the controversy was a distraction from the substance of his speech.",
      "\"The only thing it's done is made the speech even bigger,\" he added. \"But the guy in France, you need to be combat-hard. He's just a p---y.\"",
      "\"MAGA will never support him. ... He's a pretty boy,\" Bannon added, referring to Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally party. \"He's never going to be able to lead France if you're afraid by the mainstream media.\"",
      "The National Rally did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "At the conference, the gesture drew a muted response from attendees. The crowd registered no notable additional reaction to the gesture. Many attendees in line for a meet-and-greet with Bannon on Friday had either not watched his speech, or had seen it and thought calling it a salute was incorrect framing or leftist-trolling.",
      "Greg Conte, a national socialist who attended the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, said afterward in the conference lobby that speakers like Musk and Bannon who have used the gesture are virtue-signaling, calling the conference \"zio-conservative\" and criticizing its support of Israel.",
      "\"Any 'Nazi salute' by Bannon, Musk or any other capitalist oligarch is stupid posturing,\" Conte said.",
      "Musk, a tech billionaire who has become a force with conservative Trump supporters even as he has at times quarreled with Bannon, later joked about the controversy over his gesture and mocked those who said he had referenced Nazism.",
      "\u201cFrankly, they need better dirty tricks,\u201d Musk posted on X at the time. \u201cThe \u2018everyone is Hitler\u2019 attack is soooo tired.\u201d",
      "Bardella, 28, has been president of the National Rally, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, since 2022 and a member of the European Parliament since 2019. He has a strong following with young voters and a heavy presence on social media. He and his party have pushed for more restrictive immigration policies.",
      "He has both expressed support for Trump but also signaled that support has limitations. \u201cLiking Donald Trump\u2019s patriotism does not mean being the vassal of the United States,\u201d Bardella said in early 2024, according to France 24.",
      "On Saturday, Trump is set to address CPAC, an event where his presence looms large just over a month after he formally took office.",
      "Trump's victory in each of the major swing states during the 2024 race against former Vice President Kamala Harris gave his team what they viewed as a mandate, which they have used to move aggressively. A prominent piece of that agenda has included installing Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, which has worked quickly to reduce the size and scope of government.",
      "Musk was greeted like a rock star on the CPAC stage Thursday, walking on with a chainsaw given to him by right-wing Argentinian President Javier Milei. The gift was meant to symbolize that Musk is ripping apart government waste.",
      "\u201cI am become meme,\u201d said Musk told the CPAC crowd, saying that DOGE is \u201cfighting the Matrix.\u201d"

It was the November implosion of his coalition, a disagreement about Germany\u2019s budget deficit, that sparked this snap ballot.",

      "That has appalled some Jewish groups, such as the International Auschwitz Committee, which describes the AfD as \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d It\u2019s also part of the reason the AfD remains a pariah in the Bundestag, whose parties have vowed to uphold the informal \u201cfirewall\u201d against far-right cooperation, seen as a bulwark against fascism.",
      "These concerns are not confined to the legislature. Germany\u2019s domestic BfV intelligence agency is surveilling the AfD on suspicion of far-right extremism, upheld by two levels of regional courts.",
      "The AfD\u2019s response has echoes of Trump\u2019s overhaul of federal agencies. Bernhard wants to reform the judiciary and intelligence services so they are \u201cmore independent\u201d and \u201crefocus on the real dangers\u201d such as \u201cIslamist terrorism.\u201d",

And yet support for the idea has been fueled by a recent spate of high-profile attacks by people with migrant backgrounds. That\u2019s despite researchers at the University of Munich this week releasing a study that found that there is no link between migration and crime rates, which are decreasing.",

      "That shows how the party has grown beyond its East German base and into the industrialized West. Here, the German behemoth has not escaped the global cost-of-living crisis and is on the brink of recession.",
      "The AfD has wooed not only those with tighter wallets, but also youths receptive to its savvy use of TikTok. Support rose 11% among 16-25-year-olds in the summer\u2019s European elections.",

He declined to give his last name, walking away when asked if he experiences racism within the party.",
      "Back in Burladingen, Carolin, 36, a tax adviser, pauses when asked which party she will vote for.",

And I hope they will fix it.\u201d",
      "This sudden groundswell has dismayed Erwin Staiger, 76, who has lived here for 50 years and retired as its nonparty political mayor last year.",
      "He wonders whether the loss of the local butcher and baker or the fading of community spirit may have boosted the AfD in a region with little direct experience of migration. He sees the AfD offering criticisms but few real solutions. He fears the consequences, not just for domestic politics, but also the risk that the war in Ukraine could spread through Europe if Kyiv is abandoned by the West.",
      "\u201cThe world is turned upside down,\u201d he said of upheavals in Germany and Washington. \u201cI am really concerned what is going to happen\u201d he added, for \u201cour democracy, but also for peace.\u201d"

      "But regrettably, Kelley said, \u201cIt is clear Kremlin-backed actors purporting to be security partners are undercutting the Central African Republic Republic\u2019s authority and undermining peace with the primary goal of stealing CAR resources without contributing to its development.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch manipulation harms the civic space and impedes democratic development,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t provide other details or evidence.",
      "Russia\u2019s Evstigneeva responded that CAR\u2019s government, supported by the U.N. and partners, has made considerable gains in recent years in fighting illegal armed groups and ensuring state control over 90% of the country\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cRussia intends to further extend comprehensive assistance to the friendly country of CAR on a mutually respectful and equal basis in the interest of having definitive peace and security,\u201d she said."

      "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 A passenger train hit an elephant herd near a wildlife sanctuary in Sri Lanka, killing six of the animals, an official said Thursday.",
      "Four babies and two adults died near Minneriya, about 124 miles from the capital, Colombo. The area is renowned for its nature park and wildlife, said Hasini Sarathchandra, a spokesman for the government\u2019s wildlife department.",
      "Local television channels showed the train engine and several compartments had derailed following the collision. No passenger was injured, said a railway official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Sarathchandra said the wildlife department was investigating.",
      "Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the \u201celephant corridor\u201d that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks.",
      "Train collisions involving elephants have increased in recent years in Sri Lanka, with elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops.",
      "According to government statistics, nine elephants died in 2024 after being struck by trains, compared with 24 in 2023.",
      "Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country\u2019s first elephant census."
