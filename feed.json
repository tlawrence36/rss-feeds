    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "Rounding out Merriam-Webster\u2019s top words of 2025:",
      "The viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It\u2019s an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla\u2019s 2024 song \u201cDoot Doot (6 7).\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage, but it\u2019s not a defining term.\u201d",
      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Some learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history\u2019s first American pope in May 2025. \u201cIt was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.",
      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",
      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",

Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",

      "\u201cThe reason was that I don\u2019t have double eyelids,\u201d said Baik, 26.",
      "\u201cAfter receiving that feedback, I started to reconsider what kind of appearance Korea wants,\" she said, adding it \"made me wonder how I can survive as an actor in South Korea.\u201d",

      "Still, stereotypes persist. \u201cThe one that irritates me is the nerdy tech programmer,\" Dumbell said. \u201cSometimes I just won\u2019t even submit my actor for that because I know that they\u2019re much more nuanced as actors.\u201d",

      "But for actors without major agency backing, the right contacts are hard to find. The American and Korean industries operate differently, and U.S. casting information rarely reaches those outside established networks.",
      "Kim said South Korean talent faces a steep learning curve. \u201cI would get questions \u2014 should I change my Korean name to a Western name? Do I pay to get an agent? Can I look into the camera when I\u2019m doing an audition?\u201d she said.

      "For Shin, the pivot came as opportunities in South Korea contracted.",
      "\u201cStarting three years ago, I realized this industry was getting harder,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the Korean market was struggling, I thought I should broaden my horizons to international markets.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are some limitations when it comes to finding an agency or auditioning for a role,\u201d she said.",
      "Shin, in his 40s, was given a chance to audition for a 20-something character for an international production. \u201cIn Korean audition tapes, you usually say your age,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn the U.S. (\u2026) they don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Baik, who got a minor role in the Netflix teen romantic comedy \u201cXO, Kitty,\" now sees her features as assets abroad.",
      "After feedback from American casting directors, she said she learned \u201cI could do action roles and break free from the \u2018cute\u2019 image.\u201d",
      "She also found working with an international crew an eye-opening experience, and came to appreciate aspects of the American work culture. \u201cIn Korea, overtime was routine. In the American market, you clock in and clock out like an office worker,\" she said. \"It was more efficient.\u201d",
      "She said her ongoing journey to Hollywood has taught her to trust herself.",
      "\u201cAt first, everyone said it would be impossible (...) \u2018Only famous Korean actors can do this,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \"But after watching me fly overseas and make everything happen with my own hands...I can say with certainty from my experience that Hollywood is ready to open its doors to anyone.\u201d",
      "Shin, who hopes to play a villain in American productions, sees a shift.",
      "\u201cThere was a time when it seemed like you had to roll your R\u2019s and act like an American\u2026 But now it feels like you can be yourself \u2014 be Korean if you\u2019re Korean,\u201d Shin said. \u201cStereotypes are gradually crumbling.\u201d",

      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation confirmed their identities but could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Authorities were investigating an \u201capparent homicide,\u201d said Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3:30 p.m.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways follow in his father's footsteps, working both in front and behind the camera, in comedies that stretched from broad sketch work to accomplished dramedies.",
      "\u201cMy father thought, \u2018Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,\u2019\u201d Reiner told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October, recalling the temptation to change his name. \u201cAnd he says, \u2018What do you want to change your name to?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Carl.\u2019 I just wanted to be like him.\u201d",
      "After starting out as a writer for \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\u201d Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast in Norman Lear's \u201cAll in the Family\u201d as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic. But by the 1980s, Reiner began as a feature film director, churning out some of the most beloved films of that, or any, era. His first film, the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d remains the quintessential mockumentary.",
      "After the 1985 John Cusack summer comedy, \u201cThe Sure Thing,\u201d Reiner made \u201cStand By Me\u201d (1986), \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d (1987) and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d (1989), a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics, all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it, and this fall released the long-in-coming sequel \u201cSpinal Tap II: The End Continues.\u201d",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. And Reiner was an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a nepo baby, doors will open,\u201d Reiner told the Guardian in 2024. \u201cBut you have to deliver. If you don\u2019t deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\u201d",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he quickly set out to follow his father into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "But when Lear saw Reiner as a key cast member in \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d it came as a surprise to the elder Reiner.",
      "\u201cNorman says to my dad, \u2018You know, this kid is really funny.\u2019 And I think my dad said, \u2018What? That kid? That kid? He\u2019s sullen. He sits quiet. He doesn\u2019t, you know, he\u2019s not funny.\u2019 He didn\u2019t think I was anyway,\u201d Reiner told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "On \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d Reiner served as a pivotal foil to Carroll O\u2019Connor's bigoted, conservative Archie Bunker. Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \u201ca second father.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that he hired me for \u2018All in the Family,\u2019\u201d Reiner told \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d in 2005. \u201cIt was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.\u201d",

What are you going to do with it?'\u201d Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \u201cAnd we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\u201d",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame, with \u201cLaverne & Shirley,\u201d but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman (played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan) over the course of 12 years.",

The famous line, \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having,\u201d said after witnessing Ryan\u2019s fake orgasm at Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner\u2019s mother, Estelle.",
      "The movie\u2019s happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner met Singer, a photographer, on the set of \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d In 1989, they were wed. They had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner\u2019s subsequent films included another King adaptation, \u201cMisery\u201d (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d (1992) and 1995\u2019s \u201cThe American President.\u201d",
      "By the late \u201990s, Reiner\u2019s films (1996\u2019s \u201cGhosts of Mississippi,\u201d 2007\u2019s \u201cThe Bucket List\u201d) no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d (1993) and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \u201cAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life.\u201d",

      "On Friday night, Naples\u2019 Teatro San Carlo will stage Ennio Morricone\u2019s only opera, \u201cPartenope,\u201d three full decades after its composition. It is inspired by the mythical siren who drowned herself after failing to enchant Ulysses, her body washing ashore and becoming a settlement that grew over millennia into the seaside city of Naples.",
      "When Morricone wrote \u201cPartenope\u201d in 1995, he was already the world-famous creator of the theme to the Spaghetti Western \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d and haunting soundtracks for epic films such as \u201cThe Untouchables\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America.\u201d",
      "He earned an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, but his compositions never resounded in the hallowed halls of opera houses \u2014 viewed in his home country as the elite musical echelon. To his great chagrin, Partenope gathered dust for decades; Morricone died without seeing it performed.",
      "\u201cIn the end, he read as a sign of destiny the fact he would not make his debut in the opera world,\u201d Alessandro De Rosa, a close collaborator who coauthored Morricone's autobiography, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if he were alive now, he would have taken the challenge and would have dialogued with the orchestra and the director, tirelessly, like a young kid.\u201d",
      "Director Vanessa Beecroft and conductor Riccardo Frizza had to find their way through the visionary work without the benefit of those notes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been wonderful to be able to talk to Morricone about his musical choices \u2026 but we had to understand them from what he left us and tried to interpret them in the best way,\u201d Frizza said.",
      "For instance, he chose not to use violins in this orchestra, instead favoring flutes, harps and horns, which appear in Greek mythology, Frizza explained.",
      "\u201cThen you have the modern instruments, lots of percussion, with the Neapolitan sounds provided by tambourines and putipu\u2019,\u201d he added, referencing a friction drum used in local folk music.",
      "Teatro San Carlo was filled with anticipation on Thursday evening as Neapolitans attended an open rehearsal. Free tickets were snapped up in just a few hours.",
      "\u201cIt was such a long wait, that\u2019s why we are here today,\u201d said middle-aged Alfonso Ieneroso as he entered the theater.",
      "The mythical Partenope is part of Naples\u2019 culture, with tradition suggesting her voice represents the city\u2019s enduring spirit. The original Greek settlement was named for her. She is depicted at monuments like the Fontana della Sirena, a fountain that has become one of the city's symbols. Young children all along the Gulf of Naples, living under Mount Vesuvius\u2019 shadow, learn the legend of Partenope from their parents.",

      "And like Morricone's opera, Naples itself spent decades downtrodden and overlooked, but is enjoying resurgence: The U.N. recognized its pizza makers as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity; It featured on foreign media lists of must-visit destinations; Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels were acclaimed bestsellers that became an HBO series; and its soccer team in 2023 took home the nation\u2019s top league trophy for the first time since Maradona played in the 1980s \u2014 then won again in May.",
      "Naples has also been celebrating its 2,500th anniversary this year, and Morricone\u2019s opera marks the culmination of festivities. The protagonist in his adaptation is a woman who, after her husband dies and she is separated from her best friend, refuses the consolation of being transformed into a distant constellation. Instead, she asks the gods to let her stretch her wings along the gulf on which an immortal city will arise.",
      "The production explores the link between the ancient legend and the modern city\u2019s identity, as two sopranos embody Partenope simultaneously, reflecting her dual nature as body and myth.",
      "Morricone originally composed the one-act opera \u2014 free of charge \u2014 to accompany a libretto by authors Guido Barbieri and Sandro Cappelletto for a small festival in Positano, just south of Naples on the Amalfi coast. But it was not to be: the festival went bankrupt and Partenope was shelved.",
      "There were several attempts to revive their work, including one between 1998 and 2000 with the Teatro Massimo of Palermo. But that project ultimately ran aground when a director couldn\u2019t be secured.",
      "\u201cIn those years Morricone had the torment of not being accepted as a composer of what he called \u2018absolute music,\u2019 as he was identified with his popular movie scores,\u201d Barbieri, one of the libretto\u2019s authors, said in an interview. Cappelletto said that, in a conversation with the two authors in 2017, three years before his death, Morricone appeared \u201cat peace\u201d with his music career.",
      "Partenope has inspired several productions over the centuries, including operas by renowned composers George Frideric Handel and Antonio Vivaldi in the 18th century, and a 2024 movie by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Morricone\u2019s work is finally coming alive to join their ranks.",
      "\u201cIt was a great pleasure to listen to Morricone\u2019s music, the real protagonist of this opera,\u201d said Giovanni Capuano, a 26-year-old cinema student, after Thursday's rehearsal. \u201cHis spirit is back and has enchanted us.\u201d",

The pop singer-songwriter appears in three films premiering at the 2026 festival, including a mockumentary that she produced and stars in. Programmers on Wednesday unveiled a lineup of 90 feature films set for the festival\u2019s last hurrah in Park City, Utah.",
      "The slate includes documentaries on basketball great Brittney Griner, Nelson Mandela, Salman Rushdie, Courtney Love and Billie Jean King. There are starry features with the likes of Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Seth Rogen, Channing Tatum, Danielle Brooks, Olivia Colman, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Ethan Hawke. Olivia Wilde directs her first feature since \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d in \u201cThe Invite.\u201d Judd Apatow chronicles comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s mental health journey. And Gregg Araki will be back in Park City with a restoration of his 2004 coming-of-age drama \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d and a new film as well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a broad, eclectic and bold program,\u201d Sundance public programming director Eugene Hernandez told The Associated Press. He said the lineup for the festival's final year in Park City \u201creally honors that well with this mixture of new, exciting voices paired with some really, really great familiar faces from Sundances past that I think will create a great alchemy for this really unique edition in Utah.\u201d",
      "Ever a festival of discovery, of the 90 features culled from 4,255 submissions, 40% are from first-time directors. The programmers laugh when they hear people say things like \u201cthat\u2019s a Sundance movie,\u201d as if it\u2019s one, easily categorizable thing.",
      "\u201cI look at the films in this program and say, \u2018You tell me what a Sundance film is\u2019 because they\u2019re so different,\u201d said programmer John Nein.",
      "Charli XCX plays a rising pop star prepping for her first arena tour in the mockumentary \u201cThe Moment,\u201d which Hernandez said is \u201clike her version of \u2018This is Spinal Tap\u2019.\u201d She also appears in Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Cooper Hoffman plays an intern who gets wrapped up in the world of an artist and provocateur (Wilde). And she\u2019s among the ensemble of \u201cThe Gallerist.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of humor that she has about herself and her work, but also a creativity and a star quality that is apparent. I mean, she is magnetic on the screen,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have someone who represents sort of a next generation of creativity embracing the world that we inhabit.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s slate includes more than a few exciting comedies in unexpected places. Cathy Yan directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d a satirical look at the art world and attempting to sell a corpse at Art Basel Miami, with a large ensemble including Portman, Ortega, Sterling K. Brown and Zach Galifianakis. David Wain also has \u201cGail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass\u201d about a woman out to even the score after her fiance uses the \u201cfree pass,\u201d starring Zoey Deutch and Jon Hamm.",
      "Programmer Kim Yutani said she thinks \u201cWicker,\u201d about a woman who asks a basket maker to weave her a husband, starring Colman and Skarsg\u00e5rd, will be a big crowd pleaser.",
      "Other standouts are Jay Duplass\u2019s grief-themed \u201cSee You When I See You,\u201d with Cooper Raiff and David Duchovny, \u201cHa-Chan, Shake Your Booty!\u201d set inside Tokyo\u2019s ballroom dance scene and Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Invite,\u201d about a crumbling marriage in which she stars alongside Rogen.",
      "\u201cThey are finding comedy in some of the toughest places,\u201d Nein said.",
      "In the Midnight section, there\u2019s \u201cBuddy,\u201d from \u201cToo Many Cooks\u201d creator Casper Kelly, about a girl who has to escape a kids TV show. There are some quirky, humorous documentaries too, including \u201cJoybubbles\u201d and John Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe History of Concrete.\u201d",
      "Sundance has become famous for its documentary programming, many of which go on to be nominated for and win Oscars. This year is likely to be no different.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez steadies her violin and scans the crowd from the sixth floor of SoFi Stadium as 70,000 fans stream into a Los Angeles Rams home game. Below her, blue-and-gold jerseys mix with charro suits and sombreros, and the low rumble of pregame noise swells into the opening notes of the late Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d reimagined through trumpets, guitarr\u00f3n and vihuela.",
      "On Hern\u00e1ndez's right, rock guitarist Nita Strauss cuts through with an electric solo as the several-piece mariachi ensemble locked into rhythm. On the concourse, fans stop mid-step, phones raised, caught by the unlikely fusion of rock, mariachi and football.",
      "At games, it's not unusual to hear Kendrick Lamar,Bad Bunny and Beyonc\u00e9's music blaring through the speakers. But the Mariachi Rams are reshaping the sound of NFL game day, blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences in a way no other team in the league does.",
      "\u201cMariachi music has so much flexibility and I think that\u2019s special because we get to show how versatile mariachi music is to the NFL audience,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez, who is the only woman in the NFL\u2019s first official mariachi band. She's the daughter of Mariachi legend Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who built the ensemble when he partnered with the Rams in 2019.",
      "In one moment, they play classic mariachi standards. In the next, they are turning Tupac Shakur\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d into a brass-heavy anthem as a lowrider car bounces nearby while fans roar from the stands.",
      "\u201cThe things that come out of our communities, all of our communities, we all represent each other,\u201d says rapper Xzibit, who performed with the USC Marching Band at halftime during the Rams game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn't hesitate. He believed it could work with the right musicians and musical range.

      "\u201cIt's pride and passion,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says.",

      "While other NFL teams, including the Houston Texans, now feature mariachi bands as part of their cultural programming, the Rams were the first to embed a mariachi ensemble as a recurring game-day element when they launched the Mariachi Rams six years ago. Since then, a handful of teams have followed.",
      "Behind the stadium lights and viral halftime moments are musicians who spend most of their week far from the field teaching students, working in offices, designing graphics or performing in classical orchestras across Southern California.",

      "That energy travels well beyond the concourse.",
      "\u201cEven the players on the field notice\u2026 the whole stadium is interconnected,\u201d Espinoza says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big family. We like to call it the Ramilia.\u201d",
      "The band\u2019s presence has become so baked into the Rams\u2019 game-day rhythm that fans immediately sense when something changes.",
      "The group typically performs three times on game day: when gates open, during a first-quarter break and again later depending on the flow of the game. Their role has expanded into community events, watch parties and team activations across Los Angeles.",
      "That evolution includes a holiday collaboration with the band War, which will perform \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d alongside the Mariachi Rams at SoFi on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThere was maybe one game where we had to cut one of their performances, and people\u2026 heard about it in the voice of the fan,\u201d says Marissa Daly, the Rams\u2019 senior vice president of studio and marketing. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Why did they only play twice?\u2019\u201d",
      "While the Mariachi Rams are a Rams-driven initiative, not an official NFL program, their rise fits inside a broader leaguewide push to expand how football connects culturally.",
      "Recently, the NFL has spotlighted Latin artists at international games and major events as part of a strategy to grow its global and multicultural footprint.",
      "Mariachi music has long been woven into the fabric of Los Angeles\u2019 public life. It's a staple across various neighborhoods through quincea\u00f1eras, weddings, parades, street festivals and championship celebrations. Bringing that sound into SoFi Stadium, Daly says, was about introducing something new to the city in hopes of reflecting what was already there.",
      "\u201cOur main logo is the two letters \u2018Los Angeles.\u2019 It\u2019s LA, right?\u201d Daly says. \u201cYou can\u2019t not celebrate Mexican American culture if you\u2019re an Angeleno. If you don\u2019t understand Mexican American culture, you\u2019re probably not going win over this market.\u201d",
      "For Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez, the meaning of the Mariachi Rams stretches beyond music and game day. It\u2019s about visibility in a space that has rarely made room for women.",
      "\u201cIt makes people feel seen,\u201d she says of the band\u2019s presence at SoFi. \u201cIt makes them feel excited to see that their home team, the Rams, recognizes that and embraces it.\u201d",
      "As the only woman in the group, Hern\u00e1ndez says she stands at the intersection of tradition and change. For her father, the moment is deeply personal, saying she broke the mold for his family's seven generations of male musicians.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez believes the band can break barriers too.",
      "\u201cI think it's the beginning of a movement in the NFL,\" he says. \u201cIf these teams know they have Latino fans supporting them, they're going to think of bringing mariachi too.\u201d",

      "For his first original feature in some 15 years, James L",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t trust my brain right now,\u201d says our hero, Ella, deep into James L. Brooks\u2019 bafflingly disjointed, uneven, unfunny and illogical \u201cElla McCay.\u201d",
      "And finally, nearly two hours into a perplexing muddle of a storyline, we have some clarity of thought. No, dear, we want to tell Ella, played by the lovely Emma Mackey, who is truly the only reason to watch any of this. No, your brain is fine (and by the way, what a depressing line to put in the mouth of your most intelligent character \u2014 a hard-working woman in politics). It\u2019s your script you can\u2019t trust, Ella! Run away from it. Now.",
      "It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\"? \u201cTerms of Endearment\"? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d? We get a bit of a hint in the studio's press notes, which mention that Brooks began his script \u201cwithout a specific storyline in mind.\u201d",
      "Hmm. Perhaps that (unintentionally) explains this tangle of half-baked characters and subplots \u2014 each more head-scratching than the next, but also boring \u2014 and an ending that's unbelievable, by which we mean not believable. What\u2019s even less believable is that smart supporting actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri, Woody Harrelson and Rebecca Hall didn\u2019t walk out in protest of a lack of coherence. (Well, actually, Hall is gone in a matter of minutes.)",
      "The main action takes place over three days in 2008, in an unnamed state. An aggressively folksy Julie Kavner as narrator tells us Ella is a great person, and super-bright, and at 34, one of the youngest people to serve as lieutenant governor.",
      "She\u2019s also a moral compass \u2014 both in the dog-eat-dog world of politics, where she just wants to pass good laws that help good people \u2014 and in her messed-up family. This family includes her weaselly father (Harrelson, intermittently amusing) who, in a flashback to when Ella was 16, loses his job in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Soon after, when Ella\u2019s mother (Hall, wasted) tells her that Dad is moving the family to California, Ella insists on staying put, at her school. She'll live with her loyal and loving Aunt Helen (Curtis), who runs \u2014 of course! \u2014 the diner next door.",
      "Flash forward 18 years, and Ella is summoned by her governor boss (Albert Brooks). He tells her he\u2019s in line for a Cabinet position, which means Ella would be interim governor. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get this any other way,\u201d he notes, helpfully,",
      "There\u2019s one prickly problem. Ella is enmeshed in scandal; she's been having amorous relations, with her own husband, at lunchtime, in a room that's technically state property. (Yep, this is the best scandal they could come up with.)",
      "Also, there\u2019s a reporter who knows this, and he's trying to extort her in exchange for better access (to what, is unclear). Her husband is the one handling it. And so we flash back to high school to meet Ryan, who seems nice enough (but truly ridiculous as a high school student \u2014 there clearly was no de-aging budget).",
      "Anyway, Ryan (Jack Lowden) is now poised to become the state\u2019s first gentleman. We can see how Ella likes his easy good looks. But then, poof, he suddenly becomes a total jerk and we can\u2019t believe Ella would even think to be married to such a cad. But there\u2019s a lot here that we wouldn\u2019t think would happen.",

His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "\u201cIt was not very pleasant to be vaccinated with,\u201d Shine recalled. \u201cThere were a lot of side effects, like big welts where you got vaccinated and a little bit of pain.\u201d",
      "Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",

The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

      "The Medicaid shortfall continues, however, an offshoot of GOP leaders being unable to pass a conventional two-year budget \u2014 largely over differences about additional income tax reductions and teacher pay. North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A budget was supposed to be in place July 1.",
      "House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to the Medicaid program. But senators also wanted legislation to allocate previously received federal money to help build a standalone children\u2019s hospital in Wake County by two university medical schools and for rural health investments. Despite previously spending toward these projects, House Republicans are now having second thoughts about completing these investments.",
      "The legislature had already planned to convene next week, but any action or recorded votes is unlikely. Stein said restoring the rates only adds to the urgency for legislators to act and locate more funds.",
      "\u201cIf the legislature would simply do its job and pass a budget that fully funded Medicaid, we never would have had to start this entire enterprise,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a situation we hate to consider because the consequences could in fact be catastrophic,\u201d Sangvai said.",

      "As the last big event of the 2025 Jubilee, the Mass in many ways closed out the Holy Year that Pope Francis inaugurated Christmas Eve 2024, which had as its main thrust transmitting a message of hope especially for those on society\u2019s margins.",
      "During his 12-year pontificate, Francis had prioritized ministering to prisoners to offer them hope for a better future. On Dec. 26 last year Francis travelled to Rome\u2019s Rebibbia prison to open its Holy Door and include the inmates in the Jubilee celebrations.",

      "His arrest and the closure of his Apple Daily newspaper, a tabloid-style publication that backed the democracy movement, dealt a blow to free speech in a city that was once a bastion of press freedom in Asia.",
      "Born in mainland China, Lai was just 12 when he arrived in Hong Kong on a fishing boat as a stowaway, hoping for a better life in the then-British colony. He began working as a child laborer in a glove factory, where he was introduced to the garment industry. He later founded the popular casual wear chain Giordano in 1981.",
      "But a pivotal moment for Lai was the Beijing deadly crackdown on the 1989 student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: His company printed T-shirts in support of the protests and he became interested in media to disseminate information.",
      "He founded Next Magazine in 1990, and five years later, Apple Daily. The news outlet attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "In 1994, he insulted then-Chinese Premier Li Peng, calling him \u201cthe son of a turtle egg,\u201d an offensive slur in Chinese culture, after Li justified the Tiananmen crackdown. China pressured the Giordano brand and Lai had to sell his stake in the company.",
      "His long-time friend Lee Wing-tat, also an activist, said Lai was a firm believer in democracy, freedom and the \u201csmall government, big market\u201d economic principle, which emphasizes minimal state intervention and free trade. This was shaped by his childhood experience in mainland China, where his family suffered under the Communist Party's rule, and his rags-to-riches journey in the city, Lee said.",
      "Lai organized informal gatherings for pro-democracy lawmakers and scholars to discuss policies over meals in the 1990s, in the hopes of influencing politicians, Lee said.",
      "He also took to the streets, including massive pro-democracy protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement, and made donations to pro-democracy parties, including one that Lee used to chair. His newspaper often urged readers to join protests.",
      "Lai was among the demonstrators in the leaderless anti-government protests in 2019. He met with then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the time to discuss the developments linked to a now-withdrawn bill that sparked the unrest, angering Beijing.",
      "In 2020, China's national security law for Hong Kong, meant to quell the protests, loomed. In response, Apple Daily launched a campaign encouraging readers to petition U.S. President Donald Trump, during his first term, to \u201csave Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "During his trial, Lai\u2019s Apple Daily executives said he had influenced the newspaper\u2019s coverage, with one saying objections to the petition campaign were brushed aside.

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile's ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast secured a stunning victory in the presidential election Sunday, defeating the candidate of the center-left governing coalition and setting the stage for the country's most right-wing government in 35 years of democracy.",
      "Kast won 58.2% of the votes as Chileans overwhelmingly embraced his pledge to crack down on increased crime, deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status and revive the sluggish economy of one of Latin America\u2019s most stable and prosperous nations. Kast\u2019s supporters erupted into cheers in the street as results trickled in, shouting his name and honking horns.",
      "His challenger, communist candidate Jeannette Jara, clinched 41.8% of the vote.",
      "\u201cChile needs order \u2014 order in the streets, in the state, in the priorities that have been lost,\u201d Kast bellowed in a lengthy victory speech that included his tough-on-crime talking points but lacked his usual vitriol. When his supporters interrupted him to boo Jara, he cut them off and snapped, \u201cRespect!\" \u2014 an about-face from his persona on the campaign trail.",
      "Kast hailed his decisive margin of victory on Sunday, saying it provided him with a \u201cbroad mandate\" that was also \u201ca tremendous responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWe are inviting you on a journey to recover values \u200b\u200bfor a proper and healthy life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. It requires everyone\u2019s commitment.\"",
      "Speaking at a public square in Chile's capital of Santiago, Jara, who served as labor minister in the center-left government of President Gabriel Boric, encouraged her supporters not to be deterred by the outcome.",
      "\u201cIt is in defeat that we learn the most,\u201d Jara said shortly after calling Kast to concede the election and congratulate him on his successful campaign.",
      "Chileans are not alone in their demand for radical change.",
      "Kast\u2019s election represents the latest in a string of votes that have turfed out incumbent governments across Latin America, vaulting right-wing leaders to power from Argentina to Bolivia as U.S. President Donald Trump looks to assert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, in many cases punishing rivals and rewarding allies.",
      "Argentina's President Javier Milei, a radical libertarian closely aligned with Trump, was first to congratulate Kast on his victory.",
      "\u201cThe left recedes,\u201d he wrote on social media with a map of all the South American countries that had recently veered to the right.",
      "The Trump administration was also quick to praise Kast. \u201cUnder his leadership, we are confident Chile will advance shared priorities to include strengthening public security, ending illegal immigration and revitalizing our commercial relationship,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "The victory for Kast signaled a new era for Chile, representing the first radical right-wing president since the country returned to democracy in 1990, following the bloody dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Centrist parties on the right and the left have largely alternated power in the decades since.",
      "On the surface, the two candidates in this tense presidential runoff could not have been more different, fundamentally disagreeing on weighty matters of the economy, social issues and the very purpose of government.",
      "A lifelong member of Chile\u2019s Communist Party who pioneered popular social welfare measures in Boric\u2019s government and hails from a working-class family that protested against Pinochet's 1973-1990 military dictatorship, Jara was a dramatic foil to her rival.",

      "Kast's moral conservatism, including fierce opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion without exception, has drawn parallels to Brazil\u2019s now-incarcerated ex-President Jair Bolsonaro and was rejected by many in the increasingly socially liberal country during his past two failed presidential bids.",
      "But throughout Boric's tenure, fears about uncontrolled illegal migration and unprecedented organized crime roiled the country, dominating this election and fueling support for a hard-line approach to insecurity.",

      "Voters elected Kast to cure the double plague of organized crime, which he blames on clandestine migration, and an economic slump.",
      "To address the former, Kast says he'll draw inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele, whose notorious 40,000-capacity mega-jail he toured last year. He wants to build more maximum-security prisons in Chile and implement harsh measures in detention centers like severing gang members\u2019 contact with the outside world.",
      "He proposes expanding the powers of the army and police and boosting protections for officers who use force.",
      "On the issue of migration, he has mirrored Trump in his calls for deportations of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered Chile illegally and the construction of a massive barrier on the country\u2019s northern border complete with 3-meter (9.8-feet) -deep ditches.",
      "On the economy, he vows to slash $6 billion in spending over just 18 months by shrinking the public payroll and dismantling ministries but without eliminating social benefits \u2014 something economists criticize as unrealistic.",
      "By reducing corporate taxes and cutting red tape, he says he'll take the nation back to the golden age of rapid economic growth that made Chile the poster child of Latin America in the 1990s.",
      "At rallies, his fans cheer wildly at these promises for a \u201cmano dura\" crackdown, or iron fist, to restore order to a country that long saw itself as an oasis in a turbulent region.",
      "But it\u2019s less clear whether his agenda will command support on the street and in Congress once the implications sink in.",
      "Kast's Republican Party lacks a majority in both houses of Congress, meaning that to get things done, he\u2019ll need to negotiate with traditional center-right forces that could bristle at those proposals.",
      "If Kast plays his cards right and makes political compromises, said Chilean political analyst Patricio Navia, he might be able to avoid the fate of Boric, who stormed to power in 2021 on radical ambitions to overhaul Chile's market-led economy and will leave office on March 11 having largely failed to implement his hard-left program.",
      "\u201cIf he governs as a moderate right-wing president, he'll find support,\u201d Navia said. \u201cBut can Kast control his radical instincts? That\u2019s the big question.\"",

      "The 63-year-old veteran human rights advocate \u2014 looking pale, visibly tired and emaciated \u2014 was experiencing a return to daily life after more than four years behind bars in Belarus. He was suddenly released on Saturday.",
      "Medical assistance in the penal colony where he served his 10-year sentence was very limited, he said in his first sit-down interview after release. There was only one option of treating dental problems behind bars \u2014 pulling teeth out, he said.",
      "Bialiatski recalled how in the early hours of Saturday he was in an overcrowded prison cell in the Penal Colony no. 9 in eastern Belarus when suddenly he was ordered to pack his things. Blindfolded, he was driven somewhere: \u201cThey put a blindfold over my eyes. I was looking occasionally where we were headed, but only understood that we\u2019re heading toward west.\u201d",

      "Bialiatski was one of 123 prisoners released by Belarus in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions imposed on the Belarusian potash sector, crucial for the country\u2019s economy.",
      "A close ally of Russia, Belarus has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Its authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by the West for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In an effort at a rapprochement with the West, Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.",
      "Bialiatski won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, while in jail awaiting trial, along with the prominent Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine\u2019s Center for Civil Liberties.",
      "His arrest in 2021 came as part of a large-scale crackdown on dissent that Lukashenko had unleashed in response to mass protests that engulfed the country after a 2020 presidential election. That vote handed Lukashenko his sixth term in office and was denounced by the opposition and the West as rigged. Tens of thousands of people were arrested in the aftermath, with many brutally beaten, and hundreds of thousands have fled abroad.",
      "Bialiatski was convicted of smuggling and financing actions that violated the public order \u2014 charges widely denounced as politically motivated \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.",
      "The veteran advocate, who founded Belarus\u2019 oldest and most prominent human rights group, Viasna, was imprisoned at a penal colony in Gorki in a facility notorious for beatings and hard labor.",
      "He told AP that he wasn\u2019t beaten behind bars \u2014 his status as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate protected him from physical violence, he said.",

      "\u201cWe can definitely talk about inhumane treatment, about creating conditions that violate your integrity and some kind of human dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Just like other political prisoners, Beliatski was designated as having \u201cextremist tendencies\u201d and forced to carry a yellow label in the colony. His wife was barred from visiting him behind bars, and he was often deprived of care packages with medications that were sent to him.",

      "The Belarusian government has agreed to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, and the country's political and economical dependence on Moscow makes it a hostage to the Kremlin's plans and expansionist ideas, in which \u201cBelarus was destined for a tragic fate.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is, of course, very important for Belarus that the war ends. And it is also clear that this end must not come at the expense of Ukraine, because the situation with democracy, human rights, and the development of Belarus depends greatly on how things unfold in Ukraine itself,\u201d Bialiatski said.",
      "Four other released dissidents on Sunday spoke to reporters in Ukraine, where the majority of those freed by Belarus \u2014 114 people in total \u2014 were taken the day before. They expressed gratitude to Ukraine for taking them in and providing them with assistance at a time when a war was raging.",
      "Addressing reporters in the city of Chernihiv, Viktar Babaryka, Maria Kolesnikova, Alexander Feduta and Uladzimir Labkovich echoed Bialiatski's statement and said that they didn't know where they were being taken and only realized that it was Ukraine upon arrival.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed willingness to drop Ukraine's NATO bid in exchange for Western security guarantees",
      "BERLIN -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country\u2019s bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.",
      "Zelenskyy sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him facing the U.S. delegation.",
      "Responding to journalists\u2019 questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat before the talks, Zelenskyy said that since the U.S. and some European nations had rejected Ukraine\u2019s push to join NATO, Kyiv expects the West to offer a set of guarantees similar to those offered to the alliance members.",
      "\u201cThese security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is already a compromise on our part.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has cast Ukraine's bid to join NATO as a major threat to Moscow's security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for the alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.",
      "Zelenskyy emphasized that any security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress, adding that he expected an update from his team following a meeting between Ukrainian and U.S. military officials in Stuttgart, Germany.",
      "The U.S. government said in a social media post on Witkoff\u2019s account after the five-hour meeting that \u201ca lot of progress was made.\u201d",
      "Washington has tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Trump presses for a swift end to Russia\u2019s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including control of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, which is mostly occupied by Russian forces.",
      "Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.",
      "\u201cI do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5\u201310 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy described the issue as \u201cvery sensitive\u201d and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that \u201ctoday a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.\u201d",
      "Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.",
      "Ushakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \u201cworsened\u201d by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.",
      "Speaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that \u201cthe contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will \u201chave very strong objections.\u201d",
      "Ushakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. \u201cThe Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.",

      "Investigators have concluded that South Korea\u2019s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate rivals and monopolize power",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power, investigators concluded Monday.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree in December 2024 lasted only several hours and resulted in his rapid downfall.",
      "Independent counsel Cho Eun-suk, who announced the six-month probe\u2019s result, also accused the former president and his military allies of ordering operations against North Korea, in a deliberate bid to stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law.",
      "Despite the lack of a serious response from North Korea, Cho said that Yoon declared martial law by branding the liberal-controlled legislature as \u201canti-state forces\u201d that must be urgently removed.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Yoon, who is in jail while standing trials for high-stakes rebellion charges. Yoon has steadfastly maintained that his martial law declaration was a desperate attempt to draw public support for his fight against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda while holding a majority in the legislature.",
      "Meanwhile, police raided the headquarters of the Unification Church on Monday as they probe separate bribery allegations against more politicians. An independent investigation involving Yoon\u2019s wife and the church has been underway for several months.",
      "Cho said Yoon and his military associates had schemed to enforce martial law since before October 2023 and that they reshuffled top military officials to place their associates in key posts while removing a defense minister who opposed their plan. Cho said they hosted dinner parties to give their martial law plan traction among military leaders.",
      "Cho said Yoon, his Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun and Yeo In-hyung, then commander of the military\u2019s counterintelligence agency, orchestrated various military operations against North Korea from October 2024. Cho\u2019s deputy earlier accused Yoon of ordering drone flights over the North, which Yoon has argued he hadn\u2019t been informed of.",
      "The lead investigator said North Korea didn\u2019t retaliate, likely because it was preoccupied with its support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, and so Yoon lacked legal grounds to impose military rule, but went ahead anyway to swiftly \u201ceradicate anti-state forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cYoon Suk Yeol ... tried to declare martial law by inciting military provocations by North Korea, but that plan failed,\u201d Cho said. \u201cYoon declared emergency martial law to monopolize and maintain power by taking control of the legislative and judiciary branches and eliminating his political opponents.\u201d",
      "In a case that showed the seriousness of Yoon\u2019s hostilities against his opponents, Cho said Yoon called his governing People Power Party\u2019s main rival Han Dong-hun \u201ca commie\u201d and said \u201cI\u2019ll shoot him to death\u201d in meetings with military generals.",

      "Hundreds of troops encircled the parliament building and entered the election commission offices after Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. Thousands of people flocked to the National Assembly at the time, protesting the decree and demanding Yoon step down. Lawmakers made it inside the building and voted down Yoon\u2019s order within hours. Lawmakers later in December voted to impeach Yoon, suspending his powers and putting his fate with the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April.",
      "Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae Myung became South Korea\u2019s new president via a snap election in June, and he appointed three independent counsels to probe Yoon\u2019s martial law and other allegations against him, his wife and other associates.",
      "Cho said that Yoon and 23 other people, including his top officials, including Defense Minister Kim, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, have been indicted over Yoon\u2019s martial law decree. Some military generals were also arrested and indicted by military prosecutors.",
      "Park said there were signs that Yoon and his allies feared potential interference from Washington and may have timed their martial law attempt after the U.S. presidential election in November to exploit the distraction created by the transition to a new president.",
      "Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, was separately arrested and indicted over charges unrelated to her husband's martial law, including one that she received bribes through an intermediary from a Unification Church official seeking business favors.",
      "Police said they raided several Unification Church -related facilities, including its headquarters in Seoul and its sprawling complex in nearby Gapyeong, following allegations that the religious group offered money and gifts to a wider range of politicians than previously thought, including Democratic Party members. Officers also searched a detention center where the church's 82-year-old leader, Hak Ja Han, has been held since September.",
      "Police also searched the home and office of Chun Jae-soo, Lee\u2019s former minister of oceans and fisheries, and the homes of former Democratic Party lawmaker Lim Jong-seong and Kim Gyu-hwan, a lawmaker with a PPP predecessor, over suspicions that they received bribes from the church.",
      "Chun denied allegations that he received bribes from the church but stepped down as minister last week, saying he did not want to burden Lee\u2019s administration. Lee, during a meeting last week, called for a thorough investigation into allegations of murky ties between politicians and a religious group, without citing the Unification Church by name.",

      "Afghanistan was invited but decided not to attend. Its Taliban-led government was tight-lipped on the reasons, with the foreign ministry saying only that it would not participate because Afghanistan \u201ccurrently maintains active engagement with regional countries through existing regional organizations and formats, and has made good progress in this regard.\u201d",

Millions rely on aid for survival, and the struggling economy has been further impacted by the international community not recognizing the Taliban government's seizure of power in the wake of the chaotic withdrawal of US-led troops in 2021. Natural disasters and the flow of Afghans fleeing Pakistan under pressure to return home have underlined Afghanistan\u2019s reliance on foreign aid to meet essential needs.",

They underscored the responsibility of the international community to lift sanctions and release Afghanistan\u2019s frozen assets, and urged international organizations to support the dignified return of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries.",

      "LONDON -- In the past year, tens of thousands hostile to immigrants marched through London, chanting \u201csend them home!\u201d A British lawmaker complained of seeing too many non-white faces on TV. And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.",
      "The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. \u2014 and across Europe \u2014 as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.",
      "In several European countries, political parties that favor mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the AfD, or Alternative for Germany and France\u2019s National Rally.",
      "President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. \u201cgarbage\u201d and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.",
      "Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.",
      "\u201cWhat were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,\u201d said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.",
      "Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.",
      "In Britain, there is \u201ca frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline\u201d and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King\u2019s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.",
      "Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.",
      "Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Germany's AfD, France\u2019s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing \u201ceconomic decline\u201d and \u201ccivilizational erasure\u201d because of immigration and loss of national identities.",
      "The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.",
      "National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s concern that mass immigration was \u201cshaking the balance of European countries.\u201d",
      "Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.",
      "A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were \u201cfull of Black people, full of Asian people.\u201d Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see another white face\u201d in an area of Birmingham, Britain\u2019s second-largest city. Neither politician had to resign.",
      "Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt it has worsened,\u201d said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media \u201cis increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.\u201d",

      "In recent months, the authorities have raided two major scam centers, KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a trading town on the border with Thailand. The operations resulted in the detention of thousands of foreign nationals.",
      "Col. Min Thu Kyaw, who led the crackdown operations, said authorities were struggling to manage the detainees.",
      "\u201cThey are different nationals, who have different religions, morals and personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want the international community to come and call them quickly. It would be more convenient if they call them back as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Maj-Gen Aung Kyaw Kyaw, deputy minister for Home Affairs, told a press conference in Yangon, the country\u2019s biggest city, that 13,272 foreigners from 47 countries had been detained since the start of the crackdown in January.

      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",

      "A leading candidate to be President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for Federal Reserve chair says he would present the president\u2019s views to Fed officials for their consideration but they could reject them if they chose when making decisions on interest rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- A leading candidate to be President Donald Trump's choice for Federal Reserve chair said that he would present the president's views to Fed officials for their consideration but they could reject them if they chose when making decisions on interest rates.",
      "Kevin Hassett, in an interview Sunday on CBS News' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said he would continue to speak with Trump if he becomes the Fed chair. But when asked if Trump's opinions on interest rates would have \u201cequal weighting\u201d with members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, Hassett replied, \u201cNo, he would have no weight.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis opinion matters if it\u2019s good, if it\u2019s based on data,\u201d Hassett continued. \u201cAnd then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that\u2019s a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they\u2019ll vote in a different way.\u201d",
      "Hassett\u2019s comments come as Trump is reportedly in final interviews with potential replacements for the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell. Trump has emphasized that he expects whomever he nominates to lead the Fed will sharply lower the central bank\u2019s key rate, which currently stands at about 3.6%. Trump has said it should be cut to 1% or lower, a view almost no economist shares. Trump's outspokenness has raised concerns about the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics under any chair he appoints.",
      "Until Trump's first election in 2016, presidents of both parties for several decades had avoided commenting publicly on Fed decisions, and usually refrained from doing so privately as well. Economists generally believe that a politically independent Fed is better at combating inflation, because it can take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raise interest rates.",
      "On Friday, however, Trump said that he \u201ccertainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is\u201d about rates.",

      "BAB BERRED, Morocco -- Since he started growing cannabis at 14, Mohamed Makhlouf has lived in the shadows, losing sleep while bracing for a knock on his door from authorities that could mean prison or his entire harvest confiscated.",
      "But after decades of operating in secret, Makhlouf finally has gained peace of mind as Morocco expands legal cultivation and works to integrate veteran growers like him into the formal economy.",
      "On his farmland deep in the Rif Mountains, stalks of a government-approved cannabis strain rise from the earth in dense clusters. He notices when police pass on a nearby road. But where the crop's aroma once meant danger, today there is no cause for concern. They know he sells to a local cooperative.",
      "\u201cLegalization is freedom,\u201d Makhlouf said. \u201cIf you want your work to be clean, you work with the companies and within the law.\"",
      "The 70-year-old Makhlouf's story mirrors the experience of a small but growing number of farmers who started in Morocco\u2019s vast black market but now sell legally to cooperatives producing cannabis for medicinal and industrial use.",
      "Morocco is the world\u2019s biggest producer of cannabis and top supplier of the resin used to make hashish. For years, authorities have oscillated between looking the other way and cracking down, even as the economy directly or indirectly supports hundreds of thousands of people in the Rif Mountains, according to United Nations reports and government data.",
      "Abdelsalam Amraji, another cannabis farmer who joined the legal industry, said the crop is crucial to keeping the community afloat.",
      "\u201cLocal farmers have tried cultivating wheat, nuts, apples, and other crops, but none have yielded viable results,\u201d he said.",
      "The region is known as an epicenter of anti-government sentiment and growers have lived for years with arrest warrants hanging over them. They avoided cities and towns. Many saw their fields burned in government campaigns targeting cultivation.",
      "Though cannabis can fetch higher prices on the black market, the decreased risk is worth it, Amraji said.",
      "\u201cMaking money in the illegal field brings fear and problems,\" he said. \u201cWhen everything is legal, none of that happens.\u201d",
      "The change began in 2021 when Morocco became the first major illegal cannabis producer, and the first Muslim-majority country, to pass a law legalizing certain forms of cultivation.",
      "Officials heralded the move as a way to lift small-scale farmers like Makhlouf and Amraji out of poverty and integrate cannabis-growing regions into the economy after decades of marginalization.",
      "In 2024, King Mohammed VI pardoned more than 4,800 farmers serving prison sentences to allow longtime growers \u201cto integrate into the new strategy,\u201d the justice ministry said at the time.",
      "Since legalization was enacted in 2022, Morocco has tightly regulated every step of production and sale from seeds and pesticides to farming licenses and distribution. Though certain cultivation is authorized, officials have shown no sign of moving toward legalization or reforms targeting recreational consumers.",
      "\u201cWe have two contradictory missions that are really to allow the same project to succeed in the same environment,\u201d said Mohammed El Guerrouj, director-general of Morocco's cannabis regulatory agency. \u201cOur mission as policemen is to enforce regulations. But our mission is also to support farmers and operators so they succeed in their projects.\u201d",

      "Legalization has brought licenses, formal cooperatives and the hope of steady income without fear of arrest. But the shift also has exposed the limits of reform. The legal market remains too small to absorb the hundreds of thousands who depend on the illicit trade and the new rules have introduced more pressures, farmers and experts say.",
      "Protests erupted in parts of nearby Taounate in August after cooperatives there failed to pay growers for their crop. Farmers waved banners reading \u201cNo legalization without rights\u201d and \u201cEnough procrastination,\u201d furious that payments they were promised for working legally at the government\u2019s urging never came, local media reported.",

Today, cannabis is grown legally on 14,300 acres (5,800 hectares) in the Rif, while more than 67,000 acres (27,100 hectares) are used for illegal growing, according to government data. The number of farmers entering the legal system remains tiny compared with the number thought to be tied to the illicit market.",

Consumers also indicated less enthusiasm for spending money on holiday gifts; their estimated gift budgets decreased $229 between October and November, the largest drop Gallup has recorded at that point of the holiday shopping season. The survey was conducted in November, partially during the government shutdown, which might have tempered spending plans.",
      "However, the worst-case impact on consumer prices that many economists foresaw from the Trump administration's tariff policies hasn't materialized. Some products have been affected more than others. Here's a look at what has happened with supplies and prices in popular gifting categories.",
      "Game and toys were particularly susceptible to tariff-related price increases since the majority of the ones sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to industry trade group The Toy Association. The tariff rate the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods became a rollercoaster that started at an additional 10%, peaked at 145% and ended up at 47%.",
      "The uncertainty made it hard for toy shops to decide what to order for the holidays. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said the manufacturers in China that he buys toys from did not pass on their tariff costs all at once but he has seen their prices inch higher with every reorder.",
      "Smith estimated that wholesale prices for 80% of his inventory went up anywhere from 5% to 20%. Some shoppers who don't buy toys regularly might be surprised by price increases he adopted in turn, Smith said. A doll that sold for $20 to $25 last year now costs $30 to $35 at JaZams, he said.",
      "\u201cFor folks with marginal incomes, this is going to be a very difficult holiday,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Consumer electronics are mostly made in China and other Asian countries. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports, and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, according to the Consumer Technology Association trade group.",

      "\u201cThe consumer is not a monolith,\u201d Barry told reporters.",

      "Jewelry shoppers will likely see higher prices, but that has more to do with the soaring price of gold than tariffs so far, according to David Bonaparte, president & CEO of trade group Jewelers of America.",
      "The varying tax rates Trump set for countries that import American goods with a total value less than their exports to the U.S. affected jewelry in various ways. Watches from Switzerland, for example, were subject to a 39% tariff from July 31 until the country struck a deal with the Trump administration last month to lower the import tax rate on its products to 15%.",
      "India, which refines many of the diamonds sold in the U.S., rushed in shipments of the gemstones before a 50% tariff on the country's products took effect on Aug. 27. Higher prices for jewelry made with diamonds shipped from India will likely start to be felt in 2026, Bonaparte said.",

He said the tariffs slowed down production of much of his fall stock and seasonal merchandise like ribbon.

      "Iran\u2019s rial has hit a new record low of over 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening its collapse amid sanctions and regional tensions",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s rial slid further Monday to a new record low of more than 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening the currency\u2019s collapse less than two weeks after it first breached the 1.2-million mark amid sanctions pressure and regional tensions.",
      "Currency traders in Tehran quoted the dollar above 1.3 million rials, underscoring the speed of the decline since Dec. 3, when the rial hit what was then a historic low.",
      "The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressures, pushing up prices for food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could be intensified by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.",
      "Iran on Saturday added a third gasoline price tier, raising the cost of full bought beyond monthly quotes at 50,000 rials (4 U.S. cents). It is the first major adjustment to fuel pricing since a price hike in 2019 that sparked nationwide protests and a crackdown that reportedly killed over 300 people.",
      "Under the revised system, motorists continue to receive 60 liters a month at the subsidized rate of 15,000 rials per liter and another 100 liters at 30,000 rials, but any additional purchases now cost more than three times the original subsidized price. While gasoline in Iran remains among the cheapest in the world, economists warn the change could feed inflation at a time when the rapidly weakening rial is already pushing up the cost of food and other basic goods.",
      "The fall comes as efforts to revive negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran\u2019s nuclear program appear stalled, while uncertainty persists over the risk of renewed conflict following June\u2019s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel. Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.",

At the time the 2015 accord was implemented \u2014 which sharply curtailed Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief \u2014 the rial traded at about 32,000 to the dollar.",
      "After Trump returned to the White House for a second term in January, his administration revived a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, expanding sanctions that target Iran\u2019s financial sector and energy exports. Washington has again pursued firms involved in trading Iranian crude oil, including discounted sales to buyers in China, according to U.S. statements.",
      "Further pressure followed in late September, when the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "Economists warn that the rial\u2019s accelerating decline risks feeding a vicious cycle of higher prices and reduced purchasing power, particularly for staples such as meat and rice that are central to Iranian diets. For many Iranians, the latest record low reinforces concerns that relief remains distant as diplomacy falters and sanctions tighten.",

      "After seven days of wind, the morning is finally calm enough on New York\u2019s East Moriches Bay for Sue Wicks to jetty her boat to check on her oysters. Hundreds of cages pop out at odd angles from their lines, and a few float away.",

      "Wicks, 59, has worked as a commentator, college basketball coach and at a fitness start-up since retiring from the WNBA in 2002, and says she feels lucky to again find a career \u201cthat works for my soul.\u201d But the reality is that even a successful run as one of the world\u2019s best basketball players didn\u2019t earn her enough to fully retire.",
      "Although the WNBA is bringing in more than ever from sponsors and ticket sales, many players still find themselves financially unsteady when the final whistle blows.",
      "\u201cThe choice is what they do as their second career, not whether they have a second career,\u201d said Risa Isard, director of research and insights at women\u2019s sports marketing platform Parity. Since \u201cwomen athletes get paid a fraction of what men do while they\u2019re playing,\u201d Isard said their next acts tend to look more like traditional career paths rather than managing substantial investment portfolios.",
      "The average NBA salary is around $11.9 million, according to data reviewed by The Associated Press. That's nearly 100 times what the WNBA says is the average salary of $120,000 for its players \u2014 although major differences in league size, age, profit margins and media contracts account for part of that gap.",
      "For 2009 second overall draft pick and 2015 WNBA All-Star Marissa Coleman, the main difference between post-playing careers between WNBA and NBA players is that \u201cmost NBA guys are sitting on tens, sometimes hundreds of million dollars.\u201d And for those who are financially savvy, working after the game is \u201cmore so curing boredom versus a necessity.\"",
      "\"Most women athletes across the board have to find a career after basketball out of necessity,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "All this is happening against a backdrop of unresolved questions about the future of WNBA player compensation. Tensions have run high in the ongoing labor battle between the WNBA and the players\u2019 union, although it is unclear how far apart the sides are in terms of compensation. Both parties agreed on Nov. 30 to an extension of the current collective bargaining agreement to Jan. 9 while negotiations continue.",
      "A major sticking point has been revenue sharing: As the WNBA booms, players are looking for a larger share in that growth. They currently earn a significantly smaller fraction of the league\u2019s revenue compared with NBA players.",
      "When former Minnesota Lynx forward Devereaux Peters transitioned from basketball to real estate development in 2019, she said the hardest lesson was learning that working hard in her new career may not be enough to yield results quickly, or at all. After a tough game during her playing days, she could \u201cgo in the gym and shoot and work on my shot. And you\u2019re going to see a result if you\u2019re putting in the work.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not necessarily true in the real world,\u201d said the 36-year-old. \"You can put in a ton of work and do a lot right and not get anywhere.\u201d",
      "The shift away from basketball also came as a financial shock: \u201cThat transition was a little bit difficult in that I had to cut back significantly,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of learning very quickly\u201d given the \u201cbig gap in what I was making then and what I make now.\u201d",
      "For the last six years, Peters has shepherded an affordable housing project in South Bend, Indiana \u2014 home to her alma mater, Notre Dame. Red tape, politics, and myriad other logistical challenges have made the project \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\" Peters said.",
      "But she says it's also the best: \u201cHelping people that truly, genuinely need it\u201d makes it all worth it. Her affordable apartment building is slated to break ground next month, and open its doors in August 2027.",

      "For 38-year-old Coleman, the next phase of her career also unfolded far outside the paint. Alongside former teammate Alana Beard, Coleman franchised a Mellow Mushroom \u2014 a psychedelic-themed pizza chain \u2014 in Roanoke, Virginia. She also chaired a campaign to legalize sports betting in Maryland, and now leads strategy and growth for the VIP team at fantasy sports platform Underdog, with the aim of carving space for more women and people of color to access the industry.",
      "\u201cI knew from a very early age entrepreneurship and business were something that I was really, really passionate about,\u201d Coleman said.",
      "She added that she feels grateful to her parents for emphasizing the importance of education and long-term career planning. Thanks to their wisdom, she made sure to seek out mentors and explore industries that interested her throughout her basketball career.",

      "The players' union has worked to further expand opportunities by adding player internship slots to licensee contracts, partnering with universities and more, according to Appel Marinelli. Athletes \u201csometimes need help recognizing that the skills that they have built are so easily transferable over to any role that they\u2019re going to take on next,\" she said.",
      "That kind of support didn't exist for Wicks' generation at the league's inception in 1997. There \"was no stability in women's sports,\" she said. \u201cOur victory was, we got our next paycheck, and that the lights were on and that the bus was waiting there still.\u201d",
      "Back then, \u201cmy dream was that the league would exist,\u201d Wicks said. Almost 30 years later, her new dream is that players \"are compensated in a way that gives them freedom to do what they want in life.\u201d",
      "Despite her own post-WNBA success, Peters says players could use more guidance to help them understand how to plan, save and prepare for the future.",

      "A quarterly survey of major Japanese manufacturers released Monday shows business sentiment improving to its best level in four years, even after President Trump raised tariffs on goods from the U.S. ally to a baseline level of 15%.",
      "The Bank of Japan is bound to take the results of its quarterly \u201ctankan\u201d survey into account during a policy meeting this week, when it is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate. Analysts said the stronger results may sway the BOJ toward pressing ahead with a 0.25 percentage point rate hike that will take the key rate to 0.75%.",
      "That expectation hit the price of bitcoin early Monday, as it dipped below $88,000 from about $92,000. Higher rates would likely lead Japanese investors to shift funds back home, sapping demand for cryptocurrencies.",
      "While the U.S. Federal Reserve has been trimming rates to counter a weak jobs market, Japan\u2019s central bank is moving in the other direction as it contends with inflation and a weak currency. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of 2.3% in July-September.",
      "Still, the BOJ survey showed the measure of major manufacturers expressing optimism rose to 15 from 14 in the last quarter, the highest level in four years. The index shows the percentage of companies reporting positive conditions minus the percentage reporting unfavorable ones.",
      "The measure of sentiment for all companies rose to 17 from 15, it said.",
      "The survey \u201cstruck all the right notes from the Bank of Japan's perspective,\u201d Abhijit Surya of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cIt showed that business conditions are improving, profit margins remain elevated and firms are upbeat about their investment intentions.\u201d",

      "Nine staff members, including six judges and the ICC's chief prosecutor, have been sanctioned by U.S. President Donald Trump for pursuing investigations into officials from the U.S. and Israel, which aren't among The Hague court's 125 member states.",
      "Typically reserved for autocrats, crime bosses and the like, the sanctions can be devastating. They prevent the ICC officials and their families from entering the United States, block their access to even basic financial services and extend to the minutiae of their everyday lives.",
      "The court's top prosecutor, British national Karim Khan, had his bank accounts closed and his U.S. visa revoked, and Microsoft even canceled his ICC email address.

His arm was hanging over the ride, and his thigh bone was broken in half and resting on the back of the ride chair, she told investigators.",

      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

      "Duffy highlighted concerns about the commercial licenses New York has issued to noncitizens Friday.",
      "Federal investigators found that more than half of the 200 licenses they reviewed in New York were issued improperly with many of them defaulting to be valid for eight years regardless of when an immigrant\u2019s work permit expires. And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued. Plus, investigators found some examples of New York issuing licenses even when applicants\u2019 work authorizations were already expired.",
      "\u201cNew York must act immediately to comprehensively audit its CDL program and revoke every single illegally issued licenses,\u201d said Derek Barrs, administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.",
      "State DMV spokesperson Walter McClure defended the state\u2019s practices and said New York has been following all the federal rules for this kind of commercial license.",
      "Nearly half of the 123 licenses investigators reviewed in Texas were flawed, so the Transportation Department threatened to withhold $182 million if the state doesn't reform its licensing programs and invalidate any flawed licenses.",
      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",
      "Investigators found three commercial licenses the state issued that were valid longer than they should have been. South Dakota also issues several licenses to Canadian citizens who aren't eligible to get one.",
      "One problematic practice investigators found as they reviewed 51 South Dakota licenses was that the state routinely issues temporary paper licenses that are valid for one year regardless of the immigration status of a driver.",
      "South Dakota officials didn't immediately respond Friday to the concerns. The state could lose $13.25 million.",
      "Roughly 22% of the 99 licenses that were reviewed in Colorado violated federal requirements. That raises questions about the 1,848 active non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses in the state.",
      "Investigators discovered a glitch in Colorado's computer system that will revert to a license valid for four years when a worker has to do multiple searches in a federal immigration database. Unless the worker is vigilant, some of those extended licenses sneak through.",
      "Eighteen Mexican citizens who weren't eligible were also issued commercial licenses.",
      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "A double amputee since a roadside bomb took both his legs a decade ago, when Afghanistan was mired in conflict between U.S.-led forces and Taliban insurgents, the 36-year-old father of four had struggled to find work. Unemployed for the last decade, he had been forced to rely on relatives for his family\u2019s survival.",
      "But a new sock production workshop in Herat employing only disabled workers has given him new hope.",
      "\u201cI became disabled due to the explosion. Both my legs were amputated,\u201d Shahabuddin, who like many Afghans goes by only one name, said during a brief pause in his work in early December. \u201cNow I work here in a sock factory, and I am very happy that I have been given a job here.\u201d",
      "The workshop is the brainchild of Mohammad Amiri, 35, a former grocery shop worker who started the business about a month ago. Amiri, himself disabled by childhood polio, wanted to create jobs and help provide income for other people with disabilities, particularly as many of them were injured during the conflict and have no other means of income.",
      "He teamed up with another polio survivor to start the sock factory with a workforce of men disabled either through traumatic injuries or because of congenital issues or other reasons. They make four types of socks: long and short, for winter and summer.",
      "\u201cThe factory, which is funded and supported by people with disabilities, began operations last month and currently employs around 50 people with disabilities,\u201d Amiri said. \u201cThey are busy in the production, packaging and sale of socks in the city.\u201d",
      "A combination of decades of conflict, a weak health care system and struggling economy have contributed to high levels of disability in Afghanistan. Data from a 2019 Model Disability Survey conducted by The Asia Foundation nonprofit organization indicates that nearly 25% of adults live with a mild disability, while 40% have moderate and about 14% have severe disabilities.",
      "\u201cThese figures compel us to act with greater urgency and commitment,\u201d the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in a statement released on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Dec. 3, quoting the same figures. \u201cPersons with disabilities must not be treated as an afterthought; they must be fully integrated into every stage of planning, decision-making, and service delivery.\u201d",

      "Hungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine.",
      "Friday\u2019s expected decision, which is based on EU treaty rules allowing the bloc to protect its economic interests in certain emergency situations, would prevent them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.",

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers will have to try to protect their AFC North lead without T",
      "PITTSBURGH -- PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 T.J. Watt enjoys being a mentor. Yes, the Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker understands it's part of the job when you're among the best in the world at what you do. Still, the perennial Pro Bowler has long leaned into it, particularly when it comes to Nick Herbig.",
      "The first tell-tale sign that Watt understood Herbig had the potential to be a difference-maker came during Herbig's rookie season two years ago.",
      "Asked what makes the undersized Herbig stand out, Watt didn't point to Herbig's quickness or tenacity.",
      "\u201cHe asks the right questions,\" Watt has said more than once.",
      "Time to find out if all those \u201cright questions\u201d have led Herbig to the right answers. When Herbig steps onto the frigid Acrisure Stadium turf on Monday night as the Steelers (7-6) host the Dolphins, he'll do it without Watt nearby for the first time in his three-year career.",
      "One of the NFL's elite pass rushers is out indefinitely after surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung following a dry-needling treatment mishap this week. Enter Herbig and rookie Jack Sawyer, who will both take on an increased workload while Watt recovers.",
      "\u201cI think that he\u2019s prepared not just myself, but a bunch of the younger guys in that sense to be able to take on that larger role, not just as a player but as a leader, and bringing that energy and just doing everything that he does right,\u201d said Herbig, whose 6 1/2 sacks this season trail only Watt's team-leading seven.",
      "Herbig is not Watt, but he has shown flashes of being the latest link in Pittsburgh's long line of chaos-rendering edge rushers, a lineage that includes James Harrison, Greg Lloyd and Joey Porter Sr.",
      "At 6-foot-1 and 240 pounds, Herbig makes up for his lack of bulk with lightning-quick reflexes and a relentlessness that helped him lead the Big Ten Conference in sacks during his final year at Wisconsin in 2022. He has showcased both on several occasions this year. In addition to the sacks, he's picked off a pass, forced two fumbles and recovered another for a Pittsburgh defense that relies heavily on creating turnovers to make up for an alarming inability to get stops, particularly against teams such as Miami that like to run the ball.",
      "The Dolphins have won four straight games and five of six following a 1-6 start by putting the ball in running back De'Von Achane's hands and getting out of the way. Achane is averaging 109 yards during Miami's surge, taking some of the pressure off quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.",
      "In that way perhaps, having Sawyer play more might be a benefit. The fourth-round draft pick out of Ohio State lacks Watt's pass-rush skills but is adept at setting the edge against the run, something Pittsburgh has struggled to do consistently this season.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting better each week and getting more comfortable with this level each week and the scheme and just trying to help this team win anyway I can,\u201d Sawyer said.",
      "Sawyer saw the field for just three plays last week against Baltimore, though that number figures to spike against the Dolphins as Pittsburgh tries to keep its tenuous hold on its AFC North lead while looking to extend its winning streak for Monday night home games to 23.",

      "The potential return of rookie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon might help keep Achane in check. The first-round pick out of Oregon is questionable after missing the last two games with a knee injury unrelated to the one he sustained near the end of training camp that cost him a couple of games in September.",
      "The rushing defense numbers with and without Harmon in the lineup are jarring. The Steelers are surrendering nearly 100 yards fewer a game on the ground with Harmon's No. 99 manning the interior line.",
      "\u201cDerrick is very stout,\u201d longtime Pittsburgh defensive lineman Cam Heyward said. \u201cWe\u2019re having guys that are learning and coming along very well.\u201d",
      "The Steelers need that learning curve to start leveling off if they want to reach the playoffs for a third straight season. The finishing stretch beyond Monday night includes a trip to run-heavy Detroit and a visit by Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18.",
      "Whether that game is for a playoff spot or chance to rest will rely heavily on Pittsburgh's ability to adapt without arguably its best player. While the \u201cnext man up\u201d mentality has long been an NFL cliche, the Steelers have embraced it.",
      "Embracing it and succeeding at it, however, are two different things. And Herbig and Sawyer and everyone else in black and gold know it.",
      "\u201cObviously you can\u2019t replace a guy like (Watt),\u201d Herbig said. \u201cA Hall of Famer, the best in the league, the best to ever do it. It\u2019s hard to replace a guy like that.

      "Hughes did not seem to notice because he had his head turned to the right and was talking defensive strategy with assistant coach Jack Capuano.",
      "It was almost apropos that Hughes didn\u2019t know which way to look after what could be described as a head-spinning couple of days.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind for sure. I\u2019m just looking forward to kind of getting my feet on the ground and get with the team here and get in a day-to-day lifestyle here,\u201d he said after scoring once in Sunday\u2019s 6-2 win over Boston. \u201cThe last 48 hours have been a lot, but I was excited to go play the game.\u201d",
      "The comments were his first since Hughes was acquired in a blockbuster trade with Vancouver on Friday. The Wild gave up three former first-round picks \u2014 Marco Rossi, Zeev Buium and Liam Ohgren \u2014 and a 2026 first-round pick to acquire one of the league\u2019s top blueliners.",
      "\u201cIt felt a little bit like we had a little more swagger out there today,\u201d goalie Filip Gustavsson said.",
      "Wild coach John Hynes noted Hughes didn\u2019t get as much as a pregame skate before playing for real with his new teammates. Puck drop was 5 p.m. local time.",
      "\u201cOverall, I thought it was exciting to have him, and obviously you see the type of player he is. I think he fits in well with our group and the way that we wanna play,\u201d Hynes said.",
      "Hughes received rousing ovations when he hit the ice for warmups and when he was the last player to leave the frozen surface.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that. But that was very cool. I know it\u2019s a hockey market but that was exciting,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "\u201cWarm-ups I think was the loudest I\u2019ve ever heard it since I\u2019ve played here,\u201d said Brock Faber, who was paired with Hughes as the Wild\u2019s top defensive pairing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often that a guy like that gets moved, so it was really cool and it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun to watch for our fans.\u201d",

      "\u201cSome intelligence agencies worry that AI will contribute (to) recruiting,\u201d the user continued. \u201cSo make their nightmares into reality.\u201d",
      "IS, which had seized territory in Iraq and Syria years ago but is now a decentralized alliance of militant groups that share a violent ideology, realized years ago that social media could be a potent tool for recruitment and disinformation, so it's not surprising that the group is testing out AI, national security experts say.",

      "Militant groups began using AI as soon as programs like ChatGPT became widely accessible. In the years since, they have increasingly used generative AI programs to create realistic-looking photos and video.",
      "When strapped to social media algorithms, this fake content can help recruit new believers, confuse or frighten enemies and spread propaganda at a scale unimaginable just a few years ago.",
      "Such groups spread fake images two years ago of the Israel-Hamas war depicting bloodied, abandoned babies in bombed-out buildings. The images spurred outrage and polarization while obscuring the war's actual horrors. Violent groups in the Middle East used the photos to recruit new members, as did antisemitic hate groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.",

That risk was included in the Department of Homeland Security's updated Homeland Threat Assessment, released earlier this year.",

      "But the commercial boom in artificial intelligence has lit a spark under long-simmering visions to build humanoid robots that can move their mechanical bodies like humans and do things that people do.",
      "Alaoui, founder of the Humanoids Summit, gathered more than 2,000 people this week, including top robotics engineers from Disney, Google and dozens of startups, to showcase their technology and debate what it will take to accelerate a nascent industry.",
      "Alaoui says many researchers now believe humanoids or some other kind of physical embodiment of AI are \u201cgoing to become the norm.\"",
      "\u201cThe question is really just how long it will take,\u201d he said.",
      "Disney's contribution to the field, a walking robotic version of \u201cFrozen\u201d character Olaf, will be roaming on its own through Disneyland theme parks in Hong Kong and Paris early next year. Entertaining and highly complex robots that resemble a human \u2014 or a snowman \u2014 are already here, but the timeline for \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d robots that are a productive member of a workplace or household is farther away.",
      "Even at a conference designed to build enthusiasm for the technology, held at a Computer History Museum that's a temple to Silicon Valley's previous breakthroughs, skepticism remained high that truly humanlike robots will take root anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThe humanoid space has a very, very big hill to climb,\u201d said Cosima du Pasquier, founder and CEO of Haptica Robotics, which works to give robots a sense of touch. \u201cThere's a lot of research that still needs to be solved.\u201d",
      "The Stanford University postdoctoral researcher came to the conference in Mountain View, California, just a week after incorporating her startup.",
      "\u201cThe first customers are really the people here,\u201d she said.",
      "Researchers at the consultancy McKinsey & Company have counted about 50 companies around the world that have raised at least $100 million to develop humanoids, led by about 20 in China and 15 in North America.",
      "China is leading in part due to government incentives for component production and robot adoption and a mandate last year \u201cto have a humanoid ecosystem established by 2025,\u201d said McKinsey partner Ani Kelkar. Displays by Chinese firms dominated the expo section of this week's summit, held Thursday and Friday.",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "At first, the U.S. government was open to cooperating with Beijing\u2019s requests for information and extradition, said Holden Triplett, FBI attache in Beijing from 2014 to 2017. But soon, the U.S. realized China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign was often about stifling dissent.",
      "\u201cIt was such a low level of information, not even really evidence, it was not enough for us to take any action ever,\u201d Triplett told AP. \u201cWhat they tended to focus on were things that frankly were threatening to the state and threatening to the party potentially, or somehow would make the party look bad.\u201d",

      "IBM marketed i2 to Chinese police to allow them to flag officials based on the value of their assets and that of their families, according to a slideshow whose metadata identifies it as being from 2018. They customized financial software to add a function for Chinese officials to \u201csign off\u201d on orders.",
      "i2 was also copied by an IBM Chinese reseller, Landasoft, which developed its own software that drew connections to flag \u201csuspicious individuals,\u201d such as relatives connected to a targeted official. A leaked copy of Landasoft software showed one button was called \u201cassociated persons management.\u201d Another showed special functions for Valentine\u2019s Day and other holidays, when loved ones were more likely to call.",

      "\u201cA fugitive is like a kite,\u201d said Li Gongjing, a captain in the economic crime investigation division of the Shanghai police, in an interview with state media. \u201cHe may be abroad, but the string is in China, and he can always be found through his family.\u201d",
      "After Li quit the party, auditors trawled through his finances \u2014 usual practice for departing officials. Three years later, in 2017, they declared him clean.",
      "The next year, Xi removed term limits, allowing him to rule for life. He used the anti-corruption campaign to sideline rivals and eliminate opposition.",
      "Soon, even those who were hunting other officials fell victim to the government.",
      "In 2018, Chinese police official Meng Hongwei was detained in Beijing, abruptly ending a two-year term as Interpol president during which the international policing organization issued hundreds of Red Notices requested by China. Red Notices alert global law enforcement to look out for a criminal suspect, upon request of a member country, but Interpol has spent years trying to prevent abuse of the system for hunting down political asylum-seekers.",
      "In February 2020, agents came for Li\u2019s friend and former deputy, district chief Kong Lingbao, who had criticized Beijing\u2019s censorship of key information in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u202fA rival secretly recorded Kong saying during a private dinner that he could no longer work for the party. Kong was summoned to the local discipline inspection office and never came out: he was being investigated for \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d.",

      "Li\u2019s friend, Kong, was sentenced to over a decade in prison for allegedly taking bribes. The party claimed he had watched porn and ignored his work, which they blamed for the spread of COVID in his district. Furious, Li kept speaking out.",
      "In December 2020, a man from Shanghai posing as a private investigator approached Zheng Cunzhu, vice chairman of the dissident China Democracy Party. The man offered $100,000 in bribes for information on Li and promised more if he obstructed Li\u2019s bid for asylum, Zheng said in an interview and a letter.",
      "In February 2021, Li learned the Chinese government had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice declaring to police worldwide that Li was a wanted man. Interpol retracted the Red Notice after Li filed a complaint.",
      "Li began donning masks and hats in public and carrying multiple phones, wary of surveillance. He floated from safe house to safe house with Christians across the United States.",
      "In October 2024, a Chinese court announced that Li was suspected of corruption totaling over 3.1 billion RMB, or roughly $435 million. The government claimed they seized 1,021 properties, 38 vehicles, and 18 companies belonging to Li and charged his relatives and associates with crimes related to Li. The lawyers who reviewed the case told AP there were serious anomalies with the charges.",
      "Many of the lawyers Li has tried to hire were rejected, threatened, and put under surveillance. At least three were summoned by Chinese legal authorities.

      "Onesmas Ainebyona stalks the chimps with such spirtual determination that he's been able to win the trust of a chimp leader named Jean, who came down a tree one recent morning as Ainebyona lingered nearby.",
      "It took Ainebyona four years to achieve rapport with Jean, an alpha male that's become so used to people that he pretends to sleep while tourists make a racket that compels other chimps to leave.",
      "Wildlife authorities describe the process of making chimps appear comfortable around humans as \u201chabituation,\u201d a term that fails to account for the struggle between man and beast as they try to understand \u2014 and tolerate \u2014 each other.",
      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",
      "\u201cThe job requires patience,\u201d Ainebyona said. \u201cPassion also. You have to care.\"",
      "Ainebyona doesn't leave the forest even when it rains. \u201cYou accept,\" he said. \"The rain must beat you, but you can\u2019t desert the chimp.\u201d",
      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",
      "Tourist guide Alex Turyatunga told The Associated Press that the habituation process is enlightening. He and his colleagues have been trying to fully habituate the Kisongi group for more than a decade, he said.",
      "\u201cWe try to learn about these chimpanzees, but they also try to learn about us,\u201d Turyatunga said.",

      "To succeed, habituators can focus on alphas like Jean, targeting them repeatedly until others in the group notice their comfort around people. One individual can help others \u201cget on board,\u201d Turyatunga said.",
      "The common chimpanzee is one of two primate species with the closest evolutionary ties to humans. Scientists cite nearly 99% DNA similarity between humans and chimps \u2014 similar for bonobos.",
      "Habituators like Ainebyona must show a willingness to interact closely with chimps, said Ankunda Viola Ariho, Kibale's tourism warden.",
      "\u201cWe look at the attitude. That\u2019s very important,\u201d she said, speaking of habituators. \u201cYou are not going to work doing this job, if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cIf chimps don\u2019t want to be seen, they\u2019re incredibly good at disappearing,\u201d said Morgan, who also is a chimpanzee and gorilla expert at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.",
      "Chimp habituation and related tourism can improve how the public interacts with the apes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe communities that are habituated, they serve as kind of an emblem of the importance of what we can learn from them and what we stand to gain by protecting them and what we stand to lose by not,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Turyatunga takes a walkie-talkie when he ventures into the forest, now and then asking habituators if they have close and clear views of chimps. That\u2019s because chimps, even when habituated, are more likely to be seen up in the trees.",
      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost full already,\u201d he said of the new location. \u201cAnd back at our church, again we have a bunch of people standing outside every Sunday. We just can\u2019t keep up.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re already in talks to launch a third church.",
      "While some Orthodox content creators are priests, others have no formal ties to the church. They span ideological and political affiliations, with some leaning far right and others who are conventional religious conservatives on issues like marriage and abortion.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Orthodox Christians are not far right. It\u2019s a minority group within a minority religious tradition,\u201d said Sarah Riccardi-Swartz, who studies religion and politics at Northeastern University.",
      "Jonathan Pageau, a Canadian icon carver who teaches symbolism courses online, is among the most popular content creators with about 275,000 YouTube subscribers.",
      "\u201cWe have to see it as a kind of irony and something of a paradox. In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",
      "Pageau, who converted in 2003, says he and other influencers stress the importance of in-person community to their followers.",
      "\u201cWe tell them to go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live this in your mind online because it is distorting. When you go to church, you meet all kinds of people, people that are on all sides of the political aisle.\u201d",
      "Abia Ailleen researched Orthodoxy online for six months before stepping inside Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old Latina, who was chrismated \u2014 or received into the faith \u2014 in April 2024, also sees a disconnect between Orthodoxy online and in the flesh.",
      "\u201cPeople who come to Saint Sophia who are very rigid, who want to be perfect and holy based on what they\u2019ve learned on the internet, a lot of the time Saint Sophia isn\u2019t a place that they want to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really have cultivated a structure of humility, of making mistakes and of vulnerability.\u201d",
      "To be sure, devout Orthodox do follow a robust program of prayer, fasting and other disciplines. Justin Braxton, a firefighter who converted a year and a half ago, likens some of Orthodoxy's \u201cstrenuous\u201d demands to exercise.",

      "\u201cI dreaded leg day, but I would feel amazing afterwards. I feel like that\u2019s the difference between happiness and joy. Happiness is when you\u2019re basically fulfilling carnal needs,\u201d he said. \u201cJoy is that feeling after that tough workout and saying, \u2018Yeah, I did it.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the same time, priests often try to temper the yearnings of some converts for rules and structure.",
      "\u201cThey come to Orthodoxy and they find that yes, we have rules and we have structure. But within those rules and structure there\u2019s a lot of fluidity,\u201d said the Very Rev. Thomas Zain, dean of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Brooklyn, New York, and vicar general of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America.",
      "His church has seen an exponential increase in attendance, which began about two years ago. \u201cI\u2019ll get like 50 people at a Bible study or adult education class, where I used to get three or four or five,\u201d he said.",
      "Zain, a descendant of Syrian immigrants who was born into the faith, is navigating the ideological diversity from which people are joining. \u201cIt\u2019s breathed new life into the church, but it\u2019s also challenging because you\u2019re trying to mold them into one community with the old and the new,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity. Orthodoxy is often billed as an alternative or supplement to self-help advice for young men.",
      "\u201cAs a theologian, the idea that somehow masculinity \u2014 this particular way of thinking about masculinity \u2014 is inherent to Orthodox theology and teaching is I think just completely wrong,\u201d said Aristotle Papanikolaou, cofounding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no logic to the idea that somehow I need to be masculine in this particular way in order to unite myself with God.\u201d",
      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",
      "\u201cLook at the institutional church. There is this huge hierarchy where women are not present. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",
      "Church leaders have made few public responses, however some clergy are beginning to speak more about the magnitude of this influx and its accompanying challenges.",
      "\u201cThere are cases of extremism and fundamentalism,\u201d said Metropolitan Saba, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, during an address last month in Denver. \u201cMany who are coming to the church today are psychologically, emotionally or socially wounded, which requires experienced and mature spiritual fathers and mothers.\u201d",
      "Zingaro, who preaches regularly and teaches courses for Orthodox women on preaching, hopes church leadership will be more vocal.",
      "\u201cOur response in my mind has not been strong enough,\u201d Zingaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing that is making people think it\u2019s OK to make these claims about Orthodoxy. We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

      "California-based Reddit Inc.\u2019s suit filed in the High Court follows a case filed last month by Sydney-based rights group Digital Freedom Project.",

      "\u201cWe believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA (Social Media Minimum Age) law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWhile we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren\u2019t,\u201d Reddit added.",

      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, the law\u2019s enforcer, sent compulsory information notices to the 10 age-restricted platforms on Thursday demanding data on how many accounts of young children they had deactivated since the law took effect on Wednesday.",

      "A private company is offering South Carolina's state-owned utility $2.7 billion to complete two abandoned nuclear plants",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina\u2019s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.",
      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",
      "The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.",
      "Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",
      "If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.",

      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",

      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",
      "\u201cWhen we go into the city at night, there are bouncers who are checking the age of young people to make sure that no one underage gets into a party that they\u2019re not supposed to be in,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the digital world, we don\u2019t have any bouncers, and we definitely need that.\u201d",
      "Under the new Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "Some students say they are worried that similar strict laws in Denmark would mean they will lose touch with their virtual communities.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",
      "The problem is also spreading into areas such as private education, cosmetics and illegal gambling services, leaving the Korea Consumer Agency and other watchdogs struggling to keep pace, the Government Policy Coordination Office said.",
      "Beyond deceptive ads and misinformation, South Korea is also grappling with sexual abuse enabled by AI and other digital technologies. A Seoul court last month sentenced a 33-year-old man to life in prison for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused more than 200 victims, including many minors who were threatened with deepfakes and other manipulated sexual images and videos.",

      "Officials will also strengthen monitoring and faster takedown procedures, including enabling reviews within 24 hours and introducing an emergency process to block harmful ads even before deliberation is complete. They also plan to bolster the monitoring capabilities of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry and the Korea Consumer Agency \u2014 using AI, of course.",
      "Prime Minister Kim, Seoul\u2019s No. 2 official behind President Lee Jae Myung, said during the policy meeting that it\u2019s crucial to \u201cminimize the side effects of new technologies\u201d as the country embraces the \u201cAI era.\u201d",
      "The plans to label AI-generated ads were announced as Lee, in a separate meeting with business leaders, reiterated his government\u2019s ambitions for AI, pledging national efforts to strengthen South Korea\u2019s capabilities in advanced computer chips that power the global AI race.",
      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",
      "The science and telecommunications ministry also said Wednesday it will require the country\u2019s wireless carriers to transition to 5G standalone networks, which are seen as optimal for advanced AI applications because of their higher bandwidth and lower latency, as a condition for renewing their 3G and LTE licenses.",

    "story": [
      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

      "Officials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.",
      "Officials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets.

      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",

      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified.

      "In the wildlife areas, we rarely left the vehicles, save for photos at the equator and a brief stop to tiptoe across Kenya\u2019s southern border into Tanzania.",

      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017.

As they walked away, she went back inside the courtroom and led Flores-Ruiz out through a back jury door that led to a public corridor, according to the affidavit.",

      "Dugan also argues that she was following courthouse protocols on immigration arrests and wasn't trying to disrupt agents. According to her filings, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley sent out a draft policy about a week before Flores-Ruiz was arrested that barred immigration officers from executing administrative warrants in nonpublic areas and required court personnel to refer any agents to a supervisor.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Cyclist Barnaby Wickham has collected more than 700 lost hubcaps, mostly on bike rides around Baltimore. They have inspired a quest to turn litter into art, including Christmas wreaths, a giant fish and a large head of Snoopy.",
      "It is a hobby that developed nearly two years ago from his love of cycling and the joy of making something out of the junk he has collected.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of the excitement of the hunt, for one thing,\" Wickham said. \"I love to cycle. I love Baltimore. I love to go out in Baltimore, and there\u2019s just enough hubcaps and other things like car grills to be interesting, but not so many that it\u2019s too easy.\u201d",
      "Wickham, 54, says he can't quite explain it, but one day while cycling in early 2024 he decided to bring home a lost hubcap. Since then, he has started stringing hubcaps he comes across to his backpack.",
      "\u201cI keep track of them, and I have a Google map,\" he said. \"I pin locations where I find each of them.\u201d",
      "Others in his community who have taken an interest in his projects let him know when they see hubcaps by the road. Now, Wickham keeps a list of them that he refers to as \u201chubcaps in the wild.\u201d",
      "He wants to do the collecting himself. That is part of the joy.",
      "Wickham also gets a hand from his wife, Kate, who helps hold materials during construction and offers opinions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just support team, and occasionally the cautious person who says, you can\u2019t drive on this road, you can\u2019t bike on this road or whatever. So I\u2019m just more kind of supporting his love of trying new things,\u201d she said.",
      "It might seem like an odd pastime, but Baltimore has been known to celebrate its quirky side. The city is known for director John Waters, whose offbeat films earned him the moniker of the \u201cPope of Trash.\u201d Baltimore is also home to the American Visionary Art Museum, which is nationally recognized as a repository for the work of self-taught artists and intuitive art.",
      "Wickham, who works in marketing for a defense technology company, stores his finds in his garage and works in his front yard. He uses expanded metal as a framework, with sheet metal with holes and wiring to hold the sheets in place. He uses zip ties to link the hubcaps on the sheet metal.",

      "His works are big. The head of Snoopy is 16 feet (4.9 meters) tall and about 21 feet (6.4 meters) wide.",
      "While most of the hubcaps he uses were found in Baltimore, Wickham expands his range when he travels. Visits to see his son at Kent State University have added a few hubcaps with Ohio origins. A business trip to Italy, which included a bike tour in Rome, yielded a find. Wickham had to explain to his guide why he bothered to pick it up.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, oh, I collect these. I\u2019m just going to take this back with me. And I showed her a photo of the wreath, and she was like: \u2018Oh, OK.\u2019 Whenever anyone hears about it and understands it, they\u2019re onboard,\" Wickham said.",
      "Wickham donated two Christmas wreaths he made last year, one to the city and another to a nonprofit.",
      "Wickham said the hobby has led to interactions with city residents. On one ride, a man who saw him pick up a hubcap, insistently signaled for him to come over to him. He wanted to let him know there was another hubcap nearby.",
      "\u201cIt was clear to him that I was collecting these things, and all he wanted to do was help, to point one out for me. And there\u2019s a lot of that,\u201d Wickham said.",

      "Brian Jack is a first-term Republican congressman from Georgia, but he's become a key figure in the Oval Office",
      "ATLANTA -- Even though Republican Brian Jack is only a first-term congressman, he has become a regular in the Oval Office these days. As the top recruiter for his party's House campaign team, the Georgia native is often reviewing polling and biographies of potential candidates with President Donald Trump.",
      "Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congresswoman who does similar work for Democrats, has no such West Wing invitation. She is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue working the phones to identify and counsel candidates she hopes can erase Republicans\u2019 slim House majority in November's midterm elections.",
      "Although they have little in common, both lawmakers were forged by the lessons of 2018, when Democrats flipped dozens of Republican-held seats to turn the rest of Trump's first term into a political crucible. Underwood won her race that year, and Jack became responsible for dealing with the fallout when he became White House political director a few months later.",
      "Underwood wants a repeat in 2026, and Jack is trying to stand in her way.",
      "For Republicans, that means going all-in on Trump and his \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d agenda, gambling that durable enthusiasm from his base will overcome broader dissatisfaction with his leadership.",

That\u2019s been a tool and a motivating factor for so many people who want to run.\u201d",
      "Underwood said she is looking for candidates with community involvement and public service beyond Washington politics. A registered nurse, she was a health care advocate before she ran in 2018, joining a cadre of Democratic newcomers that included military veterans, educators, activists and business owners.",
      "\u201cIt's about having ordinary Americans step up\" in a way that \u201cdraws a sharp contrast with the actions of these MAGA extremists,\u201d she said.",
      "It's routine for a president's party to lose ground in Congress during the first midterms after winning the White House. Trump, however, is in the rare position to test that historical trend with a second, nonconsecutive presidency.",
      "Neither party has released its list of favored candidates in targeted seats. But Jack said Oval Office discussions with Trump focus on who can align with the White House in a way that can win.",
      "Jack highlighted former Maine Gov. Paul LePage as an example. LePage is running in a GOP-leaning district where Democrats face the challenge of replacing Rep. Jared Golden, another member of the party\u2019s 2018 class who recently announced he would not seek reelection.",
      "Trump\u2019s involvement contrasts with 2017, when he was not as tied to House leadership, including then-Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on details of the midterm campaign as he is now. Jack, who got his start with Trump by managing delegate outreach before the 2016 convention, was White House deputy political director during that span. He was promoted to political director after the 2018 losses.",
      "Jack continued advising the president, especially on his endorsements, between Trump's 2021 departure for the White House and Jack's own congressional campaign in 2024. He described Trump as intimately involved in recruitment decisions and open to advice on his endorsements since those 2018 defeats.",
      "Trump loyalty will not always be easy to measure, especially in first-time candidates.",
      "But Jack said Republicans have quality options. He pointed to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Republicans could have a competitive primary that includes Jose Orozco, a former Drug Enforcement Administration contractor, and Greg Cunningham, a former Marine and police officer.",

She shares those experiences with recruits, sharpening how they can connect their ideas and background to the job of a congressperson.",

Elaine Luria, another Underwood classmate and former naval officer, is running again in Virginia after losing her seat in 2022. Luria was among the lead House investigators of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",

      "Democrats also noted the need to find candidates who reflect a district's cultural sensibilities, meaning a candidate who can withstand Republican accusations that national Democrats are out of touch with many voters.",
      "For instance, in a South Texas district, the top potential Democratic challenger is Tejano music star Bobby Pulido. The five-time Latin Grammy nominee has criticized progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York for using the term \u201cLatinx\u201d rather than \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cLatina.\u201d",
      "Mid-decade gerrymandering, mostly in Republican-led states at Trump\u2019s behest, leaves the state of the 435 House districts in flux. Even with the changes, Democrats identify more than three dozen Republican-held seats they believe will be competitive. Republicans counter with about two dozen Democratic-held seats they think can flip.",
      "In the Southwest, Democrats are targeting three Republican seats in Arizona. The GOP is aiming at three Democratic seats in Nevada. From the Midwest across to the Philadelphia suburbs, Democrats want to flip two Iowa seats, two in Wisconsin three in Michigan, three in Ohio and four in Pennsylvania. Republicans are targeting four Democratic seats in New York.",
      "Nearly all Democratic targets were within a 15-percentage point margin in 2024, many of them much closer than that. Democratic candidates in 2025 special elections typically managed double-digit gains compared with Trump\u2019s margins in 2024, including a recent special House election in Tennessee, when Democrats came within 9 points in a district Trump won by 22 points.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of shifts that we saw in 2017 before the 2018 wins,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a top official at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cSo, it becomes a mix of that national environment and finding the right candidates who fit a district and can take advantage.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have a murderer out there,\u201d said Attorney General Peter Neronha, while Providence Mayor Brett Smiley acknowledged that \u201dthe news is likely to cause fresh anxiety for our community.\"",
      "Despite an enhanced police presence at Brown, officials are not recommending another shelter-in-place order like the one that followed the Saturday afternoon shooting, when hundreds of officers searched for the shooter and urged students and staff to shelter in place. The lockdown, which stretched into the night, was lifted early Sunday, but authorities had not yet released information about a potential motive.",
      "On Sunday morning, officials took into custody a person of interest at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Providence. Two people familiar with the matter identified that individual as a 24-year-old man from Wisconsin, though authorities never released the individual's name.",
      "\"I\u2019ve been around long enough to know that sometimes you head in one direction and then you have to regroup and go in another and that\u2019s exactly what has happened over the last 24 hours or so,\u201d Neronha said.",
      "He said that \u201ccertainly there was some degree of evidence that pointed to the individual\u201d who'd been taken into custody but \u201cthat evidence needed to be corroborated and confirmed. And over the last 24 hours leading into just very, very recently, that evidence now points in a different direction.\u201d",
      "The shooting occurred during one of the busiest moments of the academic calendar, as final exams were underway. Brown canceled all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects for the semester and told students they could leave campus, underscoring the scale of the disruption and the gravity of the attack.",
      "As police scoured the area for the shooter, many students remained barricaded in rooms while others hid behind furniture and bookshelves. One video showed students in a library shaking and wincing as they heard loud bangs just before police entered the room to clear the building.",
      "University President Christina Paxson teared up while describing her conversations with students both on campus and in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey are amazing and they\u2019re supporting each other,\u201d she said at a news conference. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of gratitude.\u201d",
      "The gunman opened fire inside a classroom in the engineering building, firing more than 40 rounds from a 9 mm handgun, a law enforcement official told AP. Two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody and authorities also found two loaded 30-round magazines, the official said. One of the firearms was equipped with a laser sight that projects a dot to aid in targeting, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity.",
      "One student of the nine wounded students had been released from the hospital, said Paxson. Seven others were in critical but stable condition, and one was in critical condition.",
      "Durham Academy, a private K-12 school in Durham, North Carolina, confirmed that a recent graduate, Kendall Turner, was critically wounded. The school said her parents were with her.",
      "\u201cOur school community is rallying around Kendall, her classmates, and her loved ones, and we will continue to offer our full support in the days ahead,\u201d the school said.",

      "The federal government\u2019s crackdown on commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants has now found problems in eight states in the wake of several deadly crashes",
      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued.

      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",

      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

    "story": [
      "An immigration crackdown in Louisiana has forced some teenagers to grow up fast after their parents were arrested by federal agents",
      "KENNER, La. -- Vilma Cruz, a mother of two, had just arrived at her newly leased Louisiana home this week when federal agents surrounded her vehicle in the driveway. She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.",
      "The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in an immigration crackdown that has largely targeted Kenner, a Hispanic enclave just outside New Orleans, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.",
      "Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests this month across southeast Louisiana, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests have taken away parents who were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.",
      "Cruz's detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who recently finished high school, to care for his 9-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother's bank account, locate his sister's medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother's name.",
      "\u201cHonestly I\u2019m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,\u201d Escalante told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to take them on if I have to. And I\u2019m just praying that I get my mom back.\u201d",
      "The crackdown dubbed \u201cCatahoula Crunch\u201d has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting. Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories.",
      "This week, Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, became the first state official to break with his party over the operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed home out of fear.",
      "\"So I think there needs to be some clarity of what\u2019s the plan,\u201d Nungesser said. \u201cAre they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids, and they\u2019re going to leave the kids behind?\u201d",
      "DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach to racially profile Hispanic communities.",
      "In the weeks before the crackdown began, dozens of families without legal status sought to make emergency custody arrangements with relatives, aided by pro bono legal professionals at events organized by advocacy groups in Kenner and throughout the New Orleans region.",
      "\u201cChildren are going to school unsure whether their parents will be home at the end of the day,\" Raiza Pitre, a member of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana, told a city council meeting Wednesday in Jefferson Parish, which includes Kenner.",

      "BOSTON -- On the same day his wife was last seen alive, Brian Walshe went to multiple Massachusetts pharmacies and hardware stores to buy heavy-duty cleaning supplies, a Tyvek protective suit and a utility knife, according to prosecutors.",
      "He made the trips after early-morning internet searches including, \u201cHow long before a body starts to smell?\u201d and \u201cDismemberment and best ways to dispose of a body.\u201d Over the next several days, he continued searching for how to dismember a body with a hacksaw, not reporting her missing until Jan. 4, when her employer began looking for her and contacted police.",
      "Closing arguments are expected Friday in Walshe's trial on a charge of first-degree murder. He previously pleaded guilty to misleading police and improper disposal of a body, on the day jury selection was set to begin.",
      "His attorneys rested Thursday without calling any witnesses, despite speculation that Walshe might testify. His attorneys have tried to cast reasonable doubt, acknowledging he lied to investigators while arguing he panicked after discovering Ana dead following a New Year\u2019s Eve gathering. With no body ever recovered, investigators have been unable to determine a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWhen he entered the bedroom and began to get into bed, he sensed something was wrong,\u201d defense attorney Larry Tipton told jurors during the trial\u2019s first week, describing a moment when Ana did not respond and \u201crolled off the bed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, have pointed to Walshe\u2019s actions afterward as evidence of premeditation. Jurors were shown surveillance footage of him at stores like CVS, Walgreens and Lowe\u2019s and purchasing items including hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. Jurors also were shown photos of tools that investigators testified tested positive for blood, including a hacksaw and a hatchet.",

      "Prosecutors also connected him to items found at a trash processing facility near his mother\u2019s home, including a hatchet, hacksaw, towels, a Tyvek suit, cleaning agents, a Prada purse, boots like those Ana was last seen wearing and her COVID-19 vaccination card. Investigators testified Ana had also taken out a $2.7 million life-insurance policy naming him as beneficiary.",

      "Another friend, Alissa Kirby, told jurors Ana seemed exhausted by travel and stressed about her marriage. The two had recently grown close, walking together and going to karaoke; Kirby teared up when shown photos of them. She testified that Ana considered moving her family to Washington and said Brian often questioned whether she loved him.",
      "Kirby also recounted two messages from Brian shortly before Ana was reported missing \u2014 one on Christmas, when he asked if she knew where Ana was, and another on Jan. 3: \u201cI know we did this a week ago but have you heard from Ana?\u201d",

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was due to check-in with immigration authorities less than 14 hours after he was released from detention on a judge\u2019s orders",
      "BALTIMORE -- BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia was due to check-in with immigration authorities on Friday, some 14 hours after he was released from detention on a judge's orders.",
      "Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown earlier this year when he was wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. He was last taken into custody in August during a similar check-in.",
      "He's scheduled to appear in the morning at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore.",
      "The agency freed him just before 5 p.m. on Thursday in response to a ruling from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who wrote federal authorities detained him after his return to the United States without any legal basis.",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under ICE supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump\u2019s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked a federal judge there to dismiss them.",
      "The 2019 settlement found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger in El Salvador if he was deported there. So instead ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. Abrego Garcia has sued, claiming the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish him for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.",
      "In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities \u201cdid not just stonewall\u201d the court, \u201cThey affirmatively misled the tribunal.\u201d Xinis also rejected the government\u2019s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.",
      "ICE freed Abrego Garcia from Moshannon Valley Processing Center, about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, on Thursday just before the deadline Xinis gave the government to provide an update on Abrego Garcia's release.",
      "He returned home to Maryland a few hours later.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized Xinis' order and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling \u201cnaked judicial activism\u201d by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.",
      "\u201cThis order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,\u201d said Tricia McLaughlin, the department\u2019s assistant secretary.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, said the judge made it clear that the government can\u2019t detain someone indefinitely without legal authority and that his client \u201chas endured more than anyone should ever have to.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia has also applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.",
      "Abrego Garcia was hit with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling charges when the U.S. government brought him back from El Salvador. Prosecutors alleged he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.",
      "The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",

      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after\u00a0 Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",

      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

    "summary": "In their new movie, \"Song Sung Blue,\" Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson play Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life musical impersonators from Milwaukee who sang as the Neil Diamond tribute act Lightning & Thunder.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:32:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Enduring romances such as \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" made the British writer one of the brightest names in literature \u2013 and the beloved subject of a yearlong celebration marking the 250th anniversary of her birth.",
    "story": [
      "It might look like a scene from yet another Jane Austen production, but this is no set. The British town of Bath recently held a celebration of the author 250 years after her birth.",
      "This historic English town was channeling the early 1800s, the period when Austen's novels were published. \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" were among those Anne Perng grew up reading: \"The issues that she speaks of \u2013 the economy, class, family, sisters \u2013 still so resonate with us today.\"",
      "Fifteen thousand tickets were sold for this year's 10-day Jane Austen Festival, a level of enthusiasm that surprised even its organizer, Georgia Delve: \"Two of her novels are based here,\" she said. \"So, you can walk in her footsteps down the streets. You've got character names on streets, you've got places she visited. It's just the feeling of being in that world that she inhabited that makes it so special.\"",
      "Writer Devoney Looser said, \"She has written books that are endlessly re-readable.\"",
      "\"It's not enough to read it once?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I don't think so. There's something new to find every time.\"",
      "Looser's ties to the author are not just professional: \"My husband is also a Jane Austen scholar,\" she said. \"We met and had a fight over Jane Austen the day we met.\"",
      "\"What a love story!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's what he'd say, too!\"",
      "In her book, \"Wild for Austen,\" Looser argues the author is hardly plain, prim, and proper: \"It's there in her writings \u2013 this idea of women being positively wild. Unconventional, more free, more artless, and willing to combine feeling and thoughtfulness with intellectual ability. That this is the kind of thing she set out to celebrate in her heroines, at a time where women were supposed to be ideally passive and not very thinking.\"",
      "Austen died at age 41 after suffering a range of ailments. She wrote just six novels (two published after her death).",
      "Looser said, \"You can read her on the level of the word, the sentence, chapter, plot, character, and appreciate what she's done in terms of craft. And on top of that, they're funny and they're incredible works of social criticism.\"",
      "At the University of Southampton in England, scholars and enthusiasts met this past summer to discuss all things Austen.",
      "In the university's collections, among its seven million manuscripts and printed books, head of archives and special collections Karen Robson gave us a sampling from a first edition of Austen's \"Emma,\" printed in 1816:",
      "\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\"",
      "\"Lucky Emma,\" I said. \"You get so much in just this first sentence.\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Robson said. \"She's a wonderful wordsmith.\"",
      "Looser said, \"She publishes the first one, 'Sense and Sensibility,' 1811, as 'by a lady.' And then after that, as 'by the author of \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'\"",
      "\"She didn't put her name on the books? Why?\" I asked.",
      "\"Because novels in this period were not seen as high art. They were still seen as a kind of trashier genre,\" said Looser.",
      "\"So, she didn't want to be associated with it?\"",
      "\"She died before we know if she ever would have decided to put her name on something,\" she said.",
      "Looser likens Austen to Shakespeare, with the kind of staying power that takes form in the many films and miniseries based on her novels. Then, there are the Austen-inspired works, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" and \"Clueless\" (based on \"Emma\").",
      "We visited the set of another spin-off, \"The Other Bennet Sister,\" based on Janice Hadlow's 2020 novel, which puts the often-overlooked middle sister, Mary, from \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at the center. \"I think she feels like a very modern heroine,\" said Jane Tranter, the executive producer of this BBC/Britbox series. \"It's not a classic boy-meets-girl kind of story.\"",
      "So, why do we see so many adaptations of Austen's work? \"Jane Austen is the absolute master of a love story, of a kind of slow-simmering, everything very proper, but kind of like boiling away beneath the lines of society,\" said Tranter. \"And we love that. And I think we love the period detail.\"",
      "That was clear in Bath, where the past was very much alive and celebrated on her 250th birthday.",
      "Asked why Austen's work endures, Looser replied, \"Because it's brilliant. Right? I mean, I think that's the glib, easy answer: because it's brilliant.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-makes-for-a-great-christmas-song/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Musicologist Joe Bennett explains the common components of the most enduring Christmas songs, from \"Jingle Bells\" to \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" \u2013 which inspires David Pogue to compose his own new holiday song.",
    "story": [
      "Every year at this time, some of the greatest songs in the world pop up in our playlists. Most of them are decades old, or even centuries. If anyone knows what makes a Christmas song immortal, it's Berklee School of Music forensic musicologist Joe Bennett. He's analyzed the holiday pop charts to learn exactly what makes popular Christmas songs popular \u2013 \"to try and figure out what are the musical characteristics that listeners keep coming back to again and again over the years,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Bennett found that most commercial Christmas hits are about one of only six things. Those thematic characteristics include \"home for the holidays\" (the most common one), weather-themed songs (like \"Let It Snow\"), the myth of Santa Claus, parties, being in love, and being out of love.",
      "Which brings us to the #1 Christmas hit of recent years: from 1994, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Bennett says the song is remarkable because it hits most of the Christmas-themed tropes: \"We get Christmas presents, and the tree, and Santa Claus, and the snow. That lyric is so well-loved as a holiday celebration song, 'cause it's literally got it all.\"",
      "A few years back, \"Sunday Morning\" visited Walter Afanasieff, who wrote that song with Carey. \"Hey, I have a #1 hit every year, but it's the same song every year!\" he laughed.",
      "\"We just kind of, like, go bouncing off of each other, like at a jam session,\" he said. \"No one in a million years would've thought, 'Yeah, we're gonna release this and it's gonna be a big hit.'\"",
      "Musical elements",
      "And what does Maria Carey's hit have in common with most other Christmas hits? Sleigh bells! \"We found that more than 65% of the songs in the corpus had sleigh bells playing eight to the bar,\" said Bennett.",
      "He said the inspiration came from galloping horses: \"In the mid-1800s, the horses would actually wear sleigh bells to warn people that they were coming. So, you can imagine the sort of leather across the horse's mane there, and it's gonna make a heck of a noise \u2013 you're not gonna miss that deadly sleigh coming up behind you! You can imagine a horse trotting to that, and it's eighth notes. Da-da-da-da. Unwittingly pre-composing Christmas music from 100 years afterwards!\"",
      "Major Key",
      "Then there are the technical aspects of a piece of music, like the key. According to Bennett, about 98% of the songs in the data set that he looked at were in a major key. \"On a surface level, Christmas music tends to be cheerful,\" he said.",
      "\"The other characteristic that Christmas music has is, you want every generation to be able to sing it,\" he added. \"So that's why kids' songs are often very simple and go over smaller intervals\" \u2013 like \"Jingle Bells,\" which is comprised of five notes. \"And that's why kids find it easy to sing!\"",
      "And sure enough: Almost every popular Christmas song on Earth has an easily singable range of nine notes or fewer: Among them, \"White Christmas,\" \"12 Days of Christmas,\" \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts),\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"",
      "Bennett points out one more common characteristic: a surprising number of Christmas melodies go right up or down the scale, as in \"Joy to the World,\" \"Let It Snow\" and 'Winter Wonderland.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think that so many Christmas songs wound up with these characteristics? It's not like the composer sat down and said, 'Four-four, major key, swing'?\"",
      "\"No, it's the selection effect \u2013 that is, we only know the Christmas songs that we know and love,\" Bennett said. \"We ignore the experimental ones that just died in the marketplace.\"",
      "A Christmas debut",
      "Now, based on the data I have studied on what makes a great Christmas song, I've written one \u2013 and Kerry Butler has gracefully agreed to sing it for us!",
      "Butler is a veteran of 12 Broadway shows, including \"Hairspray,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She knows her way around a song \u2013 and the holidays hold a special meaning for her. \"My whole family is obsessed with Christmas,\" she said. \"We had our decorations up way before Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Asked what a Christmas song does for her emotionally that a pop song doesn't, Butler replied, \"I think it's the nostalgia. It brings back all these memories when we were little, singing them with our parents, and now we're older and we're singing them with our kids.\"",
      "Now, songwriter Walter Afanasieff and Joe Bennett both say that just including all the traditional musical ingredients doesn't automatically make a song great. \"It's not, like, a formula or an algorithm,\" said Afanasieff.",
      "And Bennett made an obvious point: \"If it were easy, a lot more people would be doing it!\"",
      "But, I had to give it a shot! And so, \"Sunday Morning\" presents the world premiere of \"The Sound of Christmas.\" It's got sleigh bells, in a major key, with a singable range, and a melody going down the scale.",
      "Crackling fires and crunching snow,Fa-la-la and ho-ho-ho!Listen! Oh, I love the sound ofChristmas!",
      "Caroling and jingle bells, \"Silent Nights\" and \"First Noels,\" All around,  I love the sound  Of Christmas",
      "Listen!  It's Christmas time!",

      "JOE HUNTER (\"Survivor\" season 48): I am so sorry for the things I said. \u2026 And I never got the chance to say \"I love you.\" So, \"I love you.\"",
      "Joe is still grappling with how she died.",
      "DISPATCHER: 911, What's your emergency?",
      "CHURCH MEMBER: \u2026 I think someone's dead.",
      "A 911 call was made on Oct. 6, 2011 at 9:25 p.m. in Vacaville, California.",
      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 My pastor just came out of the house, and he's really, really upset and he told me to call the cops. He thinks his wife's dead \u2026",
      "DISPATCHER: What's his name?",
      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 His name is Mark Lewis.",
      "DISPATCHER: Can I talk to Mark?",
      "DISPATCHER: \u2026 Can you tell me what happened?",
      "MARK LEWIS: I have no clue what happened \u2026",
      "MARK LEWIS:\u00a0 Oh, I don't want to talk about it. \u2026 I don't want to talk about what she looks like.",
      "THE SCENE AT JOANNA'S HOUSE",
      "It was a terrible sight. Mark Lewis' 36-year-old wife Joanna hanging inside a bedroom closet.",
      "MARK LEWIS (to 911): Send somebody out here quick.",
      "DISPATCHER: Mark, they're on the way, honey.",
      "14 minutes later, at 9:39 p.m., according to the Solano County Sheriff's report, a deputy was on the scene.",
      "Captain Jackson Harris reviewed the case with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He cut her down \u2026 tried to find any signs of life. \u2026 There were not any signs of life that were there, unfortunately.",
      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",
      "Had Joanna taken her own life? Mark Lewis, the 36-year-old pastor of The Fellowship Baptist Church, was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and briefly questioned.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He provided a statement.",
      "He said his wife \"did not appear to be depressed,\" \"has no history of mental illness\" and \"has never attempted suicide.\"",
      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: The husband is saying \u2026 my wife did this out of the blue. ...",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That \u2014  that was his statement that he provided \u2026 people commit suicide for a variety of reasons. Some people keep it to themselves \u2026 some people tell the world.",
      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",
      "Joe Hunter: He said, \"your sister's gone.\"",
      "First, the gut punch.",
      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",
      "And then, almost instantly, one thought, one name: Mark Lewis.",
      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",
      "Captain Harris says the anonymous male DNA has never been identified.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: They should find out whose DNA is on that damn \u2014 on that \u2014 on that robe.",
      "Daryl Snedeker, former church member and retired Solano County deputy sheriff, says things were missed.",
      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",
      "And a team of experts was about to come forward for the Hunter family, offering help and hope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: This is a homicide. There is no question.",
      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",
      "Bill Smock: She was dead \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 When the bathrobe \u2014",
      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",
      "Bill Smock: Joanna's scene was staged. She was killed with a rope, and then to make it look like a suicide, she was hung up by the bathrobe sash after she was already dead.",
      "Casey Gwynn: Domestic violence homicides are the number one staged murders in America.",
      "Casey Gwinn was sure Joanna's case was what he calls a hidden homicide. He and Gael Strack are the co-founders of\u00a0Alliance for HOPE International, an advocacy group for survivors of domestic violence and their families.",

      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",

      "\"Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives,\" the king said Friday.",
      "\"I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life even while undergoing treatment,\" he added.",
      "The recorded message gave Charles the opportunity to reflect on his experiences in the 22 months since he announced he would undergo treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.",
      "He said he had been deeply troubled to learn that at least 9 million people in the U.K. weren't up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.",
      "\"That is at least 9 million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he stressed.",
      "He highlighted how when bowel cancer is caught at the earliest stage, around nine in 10 people survive for at least five years. \"When diagnosed late, that falls to just one in 10,\" Charles said.",
      "Royal sources said it should not be assumed the king was being treated for bowel cancer. While the palace hasn't specified what type of cancer the king has, officials said the cancer was discovered after treatment for an enlarged prostate revealed \"a separate issue of concern.\"",
      "Charles' decision to disclose his diagnosis was a departure for Britain's royals, who have traditionally considered their health to be a personal matter and shared few details with the public.",
      "\"His majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said at the time.",
      "Since then, Charles has used his own story to highlight the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Cancer Research UK recorded a 33% increase in visits to its website in the weeks after the king's diagnosis, as people sought information about the signs of cancer.",
      "The monarch suspended public engagements for about two months after his diagnosis so he could focus on his treatment and recovery. But he continued with state business and retained his constitutional role as head of state.",
      "Charles returned to public-facing events in April of last year with a visit to a cancer treatment center at University College Hospital in central London, where he met with staff and shared stories with fellow cancer patients.",
      "\"It's always a bit of a shock, isn't it, when they tell you,\" he said at the time, sympathizing with one patient as chemotherapy drugs dripped into her arm.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "An urgent advisory warning people against eating foraged mushrooms was issued by the California Department of Public Health on Friday due to recent amatoxin poisonings.",
      "As of Friday, there were 21 poisonings confirmed by the California Poison Control System linked to eating wild, foraged mushrooms, such as death caps, the CDPH said.",
      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",
      "\"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season,\" said Dr. Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-subsidies-obamacare-health-insurance-affordable-care-act/",
    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "The Made in America Holiday Gift Guide, promoting products made in the U.S., includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states. For small business owners, being included in this year's gift guide feels close to a Christmas miracle.",
    "story": [
      "'Tis the season for holiday gift guides. You know, the ones that suggest 31 fish gifts for your fish-obsessed friends. They're everywhere this time of year, though nowhere quite as surprising as a seemingly run-of-the-mill office in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I will candidly admit that when we started this a dozen years ago, I thought it was a fun thing to do,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade advocacy and lobbying group that works to strengthen manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's just a break from talking about tariffs and policy and regulation. And so, the gift guide was kind of like a whimsical thing. It's grown into something much larger than that.\"",
      "Unlike other holiday gift guides, theirs features only products made in America, from cowboy hat racks made in Wyoming, to giant stuffed animals from South Carolina. The list includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states.",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "Made in America Holiday Gift Guide (from the Alliance for American Manufacturing)",
      "And it's a very big deal for the companies included. \"It can be very uplifting to some of these companies, because some are like, how did you find us?\" Paul laughed.",
      "As a proud Marylander, Shelby Blondell dreamed of a better way to dig into the state's official unofficial cuisine. The result? The Sheller. Her small business, in a quiet Baltimore suburb, is a labor of love that is keeping manufacturing close to home.",
      "\"All along, I even had a lot of people when I was, you know, creating it saying like, 'You should just be making this overseas, you'll make so much more money,'\" Blondell said. \"And money's great. We need money to live. But you know, the cost of what that would've been didn't seem to outweigh kind of that value in my mind of wanting to have this be made here.\"",
      "Value like partnering with a local fabricator that uses American steel, which means the Sheller has avoided the sting of recent tariffs. \"If I would've been hit with tariffs of making this overseas somewhere right now, I don't know that I could still be in business,\" Blondell said.",
      "This gift guide knows that your pets, of course, deserve stocking stuffers as well, and it suggests\u00a0Cycle Dog\u00a0in Portland, Oregon. For 16 years, founder Lynette Fidrych and her team have been recycling bicycle tire inner tubes to make leashes and collars. And yes, this collar does have a bottle opener. \"Portland is known for biking, beer, sustainability, and dogs,\" Fidrych laughed.",
      "A former Nike employee, Fidrych now employs about 30 workers at her Portland factory. \"Made in America\" means higher labor cost, and sometimes higher price tags. But to her, it also means higher quality. \"We make a product and we put it in the dog run and have a hundred dogs play with it,\" she said. \"And so, when we sell this toy, we're like, yeah, it's gonna last.",
      "\"Most people assume that plush toys are made in China, even my retailers,\" she said. \"And I'm like, 'No, we hand-make these here in the U.S. There's a flag on the tag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in D.C., Scott Paul is actually pretty easy to shop for: his shirt, made in New Jersey; his belt, made out of American leather; his shoes, from Meridian, Mississippi.",
      "For those of us still scrambling for a last-minute gift, Paul says to look close to home, and to start with the guide that brings not just holiday cheer, but maybe a little American pride.",
      "\"No one needs to say, 'Everything I have to own or buy has to be made in the United States'; that doesn't do anybody any favors, and it's really hard to pull off,\" he said. However, \"If you can't find one thing that looks really cool and is also affordable on our gift guide, I would be shocked. Try it once, the odds are you're gonna come back and want more.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-the-prospects-for-laid-off-workers/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:55:39 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",

    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",

    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",

That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",

      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply country-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-website-1-million-platinum-card-how-it-works/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is the U.S. agency that works to promote the safety of consumer products, has lost key leadership and staff over the last year. Among them are two former commissioners who say consumers are paying the price for the cuts at the agency.",
      "For Trista Hamsmith, the safety risks posed by some products are personal. In December 2020, her 18-month-old daughter Reese died after swallowing a button battery she accessed from a remote two months earlier.",
      "The batteries are tiny, coin-sized and deadly when ingested. It burned through Reese's esophagus and after months of surgeries, doctors couldn't save her.",
      "\"I prayed and I prayed, but we didn't get her back. I got to hold her again, but she was gone,\" Hamsmith said, recalling the moment. \"She was a baby and her life was taken too soon.\"",
      "Push for better safety protections",
      "Hamsmith turned her grief into action. She launched a nonprofit and helped pass\u00a0\"Reese's Law\" in 2022, making button batteries harder for kids to access.",
      "But the law didn't cover toys.",
      "Her next push was to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, to apply those same standards to toys.",
      "The initiative stalled this past summer, after President Trump removed three democratic commissioners and reduced the five-member commission to just two, including the May ouster of former commissioner Richard Trumka.",
      "Trumka blames current leadership at the agency for the holdup.",
      "\"This rule would have simply made toys, the thing that we intentionally put in our children's hand, as safe as everything else they get their hands on,\" Trumka said. \"It's as common sense as you could possibly get and somehow it's not moving forward.\"",
      "He said it doesn't make sense.",
      "\"We have a solution to that that's just completely fallen aside because industry said we don't want it and the current leadership of the agency capitulated to that,\" he said.",
      "Hamsmith said for parents like her, it's more than a bureaucratic stalemate.",
      "\"On a level like mine, a story like Reese's, why this agency is so important, it's important for child safety. It's important for the safety of the American people,\" she said.",
      "CPSC commissioner and staffing cuts",
      "Trumka alleges that in May, the Trump administration\u00a0illegally removed him and fellow Democratic commissioners\u00a0Alex Hoehn-Saric and Mary Boyle, and cut critical agency staff.",
      "He also claims more than a dozen other proposed safety rules have stalled since then.",
      "\"People will be injured and people will die as a result of inaction from CPSC,\" Trumka said.",
      "The CPSC was created by Congress as an independent agency with five bipartisan commissioners, meant to be free of political pressure.",
      "\"CPSC is a health and safety organization,\" said former CPSC chair Hoehn-Saric. \"You want organizations like that to be focused on the facts and focused on the science because we're trying to keep people from dying. You don't want politics to come into those decisions.\"",
      "The ousted commissioners allege their removal was a violation of the law and are fighting in court to be reinstated.",
      "CPSC maintains stance on firings, safety regulations",
      "In a statement, the CPSC maintains the president's firing of the three commissioners was done lawfully and \"has had no impact on the CPSC's mission to protect American families from unsafe products.\"",
      "But in September, the agency was down to one commissioner after Republican Dougg Dziak resigned.",
      "With a single commissioner, Trumka said protections can't be passed.",
      "\"We have quorum requirements that to pass a rule, you need two commissioners. They have one,\" he said. \"It shows they have no intent to pass new rules to protect the public against problems that are coming up.\"",
      "The CPSC denied they are hindered and said rulemaking and enforcement is ongoing.",
      "When asked about the stalled battery rule, the CPSC said it \"...measures success based on how many unsafe products it keeps out of the hands of American consumers, not the number of regulations it enacts.\"",
      "The Toy Association, a trade association for the toy industry, told CBS News that while it is not resistant to stricter rules around button batteries, current science, it argues, hasn't shown flaws in the current standards or that new proposals would make it any safer.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in history, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record was the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history.",
      "Twelve out of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "summary": "Current SAVE borrowers will have \"limited time\" to enroll in a new loan repayment plan and begin repaying their loans, the Education Department said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",
      "The Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0the SAVE program in 2023, calling it the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" The plan allowed 4.6 million of the program's more than 7 million enrollees to lower their monthly bills to $0 per month,\u00a0according\u00a0to Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group.",
      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

      "Many U.S. employees are fretting over AI-driven technology shifts, political turmoil and the state of the economy, according to a new report\u00a0from Glassdoor.",
      "Those crosscurrents have left workers feeling generally exhausted, according to the job search firm, which on Wednesday named \"fatigue\" as its 2025 word of the year based on how often Glassdoor users mentioned it in the company's online forum. Glassdoor said use of the word in its online community jumped 41% in 2025, compared with the previous year.",
      "\"When we asked professionals in the spring, 'Do you feel like events in the news are draining your energy at work?', 78% said yes. Turns out, that exhaustion never really went away,\" Glassdoor said.",
      "Economic worries were also front and center, with many Glassdoor users expressing frustration that their paychecks have not kept pace with inflation. Mentions of \"stagflation,\" the economic term used to describe periods marked by high prices and weak economic growth, spiked threefold compared to last year, according to Glassdoor.",
      "Such concerns appear to jibe with rising public concerns about the cost of food, housing and other necessities.",
      "Chatter about AI disrupting the job landscape was also prevalent across Glassdoor's community, the company's survey shows. Mentions of the term \"agentic\" \u2014 a reference to the AI bots businesses are implementing across retail, travel and many other industry sectors \u2014 soared more than 2,200% from a year ago, as workers scrambled to learn how to use new AI tools.",
      "Political conversations also infiltrated the workplace, with mentions of \"inauguration\" spiking 875% compared to 2024, according to Glassdoor.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",
      "\"We're bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. \"You can call it 'affordability' or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.\"",
      "The economy has proved resilient this year despite earlier fears about the impact of steep new U.S. tariffs on imports. After losing steam in the first quarter, the nation's gross domestic product has accelerated in the second half of 2025, while the nation's labor market has remained steady despite slowing payroll gains.",
      "Financial markets also continue to hover in record territory, shrugging off concerns about a bubble in AI companies.",
      "At the same time, some experts describe the economy as \"K-shaped\" \u2014 a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder.",
      "Aimee  Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Fin  Daniel G\u00f3mez and \n                                                  \n                                  Olivia  Rinaldi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is being held on $4 million bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on Twitter. CBS News has asked the White House if the president has any evidence the Reiners' deaths were linked to their political views.",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

    "summary": "Daniel Hodges, a D.C. metropolitan police officer, says he's trying to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.",
    "story": [
      "Daniel Hodges thinks of himself as an introvert \u2014 he's soft-spoken and says he's averse to the spotlight. At night, he's a local police officer in Washington, D.C. But during his off-duty hours this year, Hodges has become a unique and very public advocate on Capitol Hill.",
      "He told CBS News he's trying to be a firewall to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol siege.",
      "\"The only thing that will stop me is if people stop lying about Jan. 6 and just acknowledge what the day was and what really transpired,\" Hodges said.",
      "He was among the more than 140 police officers injured while trying to stop the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "With Republicans now in control of the White House and Congress and some in the party downplaying the severity of the Capitol siege, there are limited platforms for victims of the attack to talk about its impact on their lives.",
      "Hodges has become a go-to witness for Democrats in congressional hearings about police safety.",
      "The mission generates some stress and conflict for Hodges. At an October subcommittee hearing in the Senate, Hodges watched as three of his fellow witnesses raised their hands, when asked if they supported President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 attackers, including those who had beaten Hodges. One of the witnesses who raised his hand was a former homeland security secretary during President Trump's first administration.",
      "As the minority in the House and the Senate, Democrats are permitted to call one witness at most hearings, to serve as a \"minority party\" witness who provides a counterpoint to the witnesses called by the majority.",
      "Twice this autumn, Democrats have called on Hodges.",
      "\"The power of Dan Hodges's narrative comes from the self-control he displays,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who is the ranking Democrat of a Senate judiciary subcommittee that called Hodges to testify in October. Welch said Hodges, \"erased any of the legitimate anger he may have had about Jan. 6,\u00a0 to just tell us what happened during the hearing.\"",
      "Democrats argue Hodges' testimony and presence at congressional hearings underscores the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who are making public statements in support of tougher laws or policies to protect police at the same time they're downplaying the attacks on law enforcement officers on Jan. 6.",
      "Welch noted that Republicans declined to ask Hodges any questions or speak to him in the hearing room after the testimony.",
      "\"You have to do an immense amount of intellectual and emotional jujitsu to pretend you didn't hear what Hodges said or acknowledge the reality of what he experienced,\" Welch said.",
      "At a Dec. 3 hearing convened by the House Homeland Security Committee titled \"When Badges Become Targets: How Anti-Law Enforcement Rhetoric Fuels Violence Against Officers,\" Hodges testified that Mr. Trump's mass pardon of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants emboldens and encourages further violence against police.",
      "\"The press release announcing this hearing made it sound like certain participants were going to spend a few hours scratching their heads and pretending to not understand why threats against law enforcement have risen so sharply this year, and I cannot abide such a farce,\" Hodges said in his opening statement.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who called Hodges as a witness for the hearing, said he did so to combat \"pervasive misinformation.\"",
      "Thompson told CBS News, \"Everybody saw Jan. 6 with their own eyes. But Trump has convinced a\u00a0 large percentage of the population that those were not insurrectionists.\"",
      "At an October hearing in the Senate titled \"Politically Violent Attacks: A Threat to Our Constitutional Order,\" Hodges was the sole witness called by Democrats.",
      "\"I am intimately familiar with political violence, as when I fought to defend the United States Capitol and many of your very lives, I was beaten, bloodied, and crushed, with my eye gouged and skull smashed with my own baton,\" Hodges testified.",
      "He criticized Republicans on the panel for not acknowledging the Capitol riot, telling them,\u00a0 \"My colleagues were under attack by a mob.\"",
      "Hodges said Republican members of the panels did not ask him questions about Jan. 6 during the public hearings of the committees, nor did they thank him after the proceedings. Spokespeople for the Republican chairmen of the panels at which Hodges has testified this year did not respond to CBS News requests for comment about Hodges's testimony.",
      "At a House hearing this month in which Hodges appeared as a witness, the Republican chair of the committee opened the proceedings with broader statements about the risk of \"inflammatory rhetoric\" endangering the lives of law enforcement and risking homeland security, including recent rhetoric criticizing federal immigration agents.",
      "Hodges spoke with CBS News as a private citizen, not as a representative of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.",
      "He had testified previously before a national audience, in 2021 at a public hearing of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the causes and impact of the riot.",
      "Mr. Trump's victory in 2024 and his first-day pardons of the riot defendants have triggered criticisms of the administration that it is ignoring \u2013 or rewriting \u2013 the history of the siege.",
      "In issuing the clemency of Capitol riot defendants, the White House said the President's decision\u00a0 \"ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "Hodges acknowledges he also has received threats and menacing amid his public statements.",
      "Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who has attended some congressional hearings to support Hodges, told CBS News, \"Danny has been unwavering and cleared every obstacle he's faced, while continuing to serve.\"",
      "Dunn, who also testified and appeared at hearings of the House Jan. 6 select committee in 2021-22, said, \"Danny's and my mission has been the same. We're seeking accountability and justice against those who were responsible for the worst days of our lives.\"",
      "Hodges told CBS News it will be impossible to convince all Americans about the truth of the impact of Jan. 6 on the police victims. When asked if he's optimistic that the deniers of the violence of the siege will change their minds, Hodges paused before answering.",
      "\"There are still people out there who think the moon landing was fake and that the Holocaust wasn't real,\" he said. \"So you are not going to get 100%.\"",

      "Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar said federal immigration agents pulled over her son on Saturday and asked him to prove his citizenship.",
      "\"Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,\" Omar said in an interview with Esme Murphy on WCCO Sunday Morning.",
      "WCCO has reached out to ICE about the incident.",
      "The congresswoman said her son \"always carries\" his passport with him.",
      "Omar said ICE also previously entered a mosque where her\u00a0son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she \"had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.\"",
      "Earlier this month, federal agents surged into the Twin Cities with the stated goal of targeting undocumented Somali immigrants. The enhanced focus on the Somali community came after President Trump said he doesn't \"want them in our country\" and called Omar herself \"garbage.\"",
      "On Friday, Omar sent a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, accusing federal agents of \"blatant racial profiling\" and \"an egregious level of unnecessary force\" in the Twin Cities.",
      "\"It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to\u00a0Trump's racist comments about Somali people, and\u00a0about me in particular,\" Omar wrote.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the country \u2014 about 107,000, more than 80,000 of them living in the Twin Cities. Omar contends that \"over 90% of Somalis in America are U.S. citizens,\" citing an American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau that estimates about 22,000 Somalis in the country \u2014 around 8.4% of the population \u2014 are not citizens.",

    "summary": "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said \"there's a deal to be had\" on a plan to address health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday that \"there's a deal to be had\" on addressing health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
      "\"There has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans,\" Cassidy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Senate rejected two bills aimed at lowering health care costs, as lawmakers struggle to reach consensus over how to address expiring tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "While Democrats sought a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits with their bill, Republicans offered their own legislation sponsored by Cassidy. Rather than extending the enhanced tax credits, the measure would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges, allowing people to save on premiums by switching to the lower-tier plans, while giving them the ability to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "The Republican-led measure didn't pick up any support from Democrats during the dueling votes last week. But Cassidy said that in addition to their concern about the premiums, Democrats must acknowledge high deductibles, saying \"you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket.\"",
      "\"I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credit for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket,\" Cassidy added. \"I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he's searching for a deal to address the concerns of Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"Let's just meet,\" Cassidy said. \"Let's address our concerns, and then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.\"",
      "The comments come as some senators have expressed tepid optimism in recent days about a path forward on a compromise after last week's partisan exercise. Some Republicans have said they're open to an extension of the enhanced tax credits, with some new limits and on a temporary basis, acknowledging the cliff that around 22 million Americans face with their expiration at the end of the month.",
      "Cassidy argued that with his approach, lawmakers would have until the end of March to implement a solution, \"because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed.\"",
      "\"We can get this done,\" Cassidy said. \"And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.\"",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia responded to Cassidy's comments. Warner said lawmakers shouldn't wait to address the rising costs, urging them to \"fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they're being able to afford health care.\"",
      "\"Fix the crisis right now,\" Warner said. \"Extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.\"",

      "We wanted to hear about that journey, but she refused to talk about it, citing security concerns for those who helped her, although she has previously said she received support from the U.S. government.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuela Opposition Leader): I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway.",
      "But what am I going to say, how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal narco-terrorist structure. And \u2013 and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter.",
      "Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, of course they are concerned, as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared thousands of Venezuelans.",
      "And, recently, it has turned even more violent, because, you know, when \u2013 when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you help us understand what is going on? Because we are seeing here in the U.S. an increase in the pressure campaign, more sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela.",
      "Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy.",
      "And we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why \u2013 and I say this from Oslo right now \u2013 I have dedicated this award to him, because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States' national security.",
      "And we do support these actions because, Margaret, we are facing not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime.",
      "And, as every criminal structure is \u2013 suffers is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market, to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil. But isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Of course, what we're doing is for the well-being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives.",
      "But Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people, a war we didn't want, a war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And, right now, I want to be very clear with the international community.",
      "The resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals. In Venezuela, a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members, to spy and infiltrate, and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on.",
      "So these resources are not going for to \u2013 towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries, that further block the illegal activities of the regime.",
      "Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart. And it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition, which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by a landslide last year.",
      "But he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And eight million Venezuelans have fled\u2026",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 since he came to power, during that time.",
      "But, in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence, though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialogue initiatives, not once, not twice, 17.",
      "Every single time, the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered. The regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time. They got legitimacy. They got money.",
      "And that's precisely what they think they can get again \u2013 once again. But, certainly, things have changed very much in the last months. Venezuela is a total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The armed forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive.",
      "And we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump, with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had \u2013 ever had a chance to finally move ahead into \u2013 towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to \u2013 to \u2013 to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.",
      "When \u2013 when they \u2013 this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? And has he promised you anything?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case.",
      "We are not involved and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.",
      "And I will insist something that I have said several times before. This is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East. We had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70 percent of the population. And what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, how do you square military action with receiving a Peace Prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, what we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace.",
      "And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply giving in. And that's not the case.",
      "It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran, and then ask the Venezuelan people not to ask support from democratic countries and democratic leaders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's absolute absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which, at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Maduro regime maintains it won the last election and considers Machado a fugitive. The regime also refers to U.S. actions as illegal and brutal interventionism.",
      "In our next half-hour, we will speak with Machado about what's ahead in a potential post-Maduro era in Venezuela.",
      "And we will be back in one minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia.",
      "Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action, pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Well, first of all, let me \u2013 at the top of the show, we have got this tragic shooting at Brown University and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia, both horrible, and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is the celebration of light over darkness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, boy, we could use a little more light these days.",
      "Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year, when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who's a bad guy, and saying \u2013 and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The president, who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who's probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine.",
      "I think it's \u2013 yes, it'd be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We have got troops potentially in harm's way. We have got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat, and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it, at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",

I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was it changed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 I saw you said that that's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after it?",

The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up three percent year over year, Personal Consumption Index is up 2.8 percent year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one the things that, if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that have \u2013 we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on.",
      "And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up nine percent. So far this year they're down 0.6 percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eggs. He was talking about eggs. Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, he was talking about eggs.",
      "And so, I think the \u2013 the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and an accommodated Fed policy. And I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I \u2013 you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So, right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of two percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right?

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Same thing, you're saying?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, what's going to happen \u2013 I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is four percent. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look in their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever. And so on.",
      "And so, I think that the sentiment \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher incomes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about 3,000. So far this year it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So, for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So, that's like an extra more than thousand dollars a year you have to spend on groceries.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: That what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, because \u2013 because there's \u2013 they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get, like, sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so, maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday and we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys, like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these were CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",

I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and the \u2013 to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be. And to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk. And he's \u2013",

And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",

      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax-free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51-48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114 percent. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, first, Margaret, let's just kind of recap the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing that Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then frankly the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient.",
      "So, I would argue that it actually is \u2013 there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge, you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: That $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple \u2013 you know, for people over 50, give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19. They would get $5,000 in an account, in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now, the insurance plan for that couple would be a $6,000 deductible. So, you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle and you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with - - come at a \u2013 come forward out of your own pocket.",
      "By the way, I'm told that about 40 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "So, I know the president has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal, too. And I think that shows you that there is \u2013 there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out-of-pocket expense, but also the higher premiums.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the White House behind you on this? Like, are they helping you if you're trying another \u2013",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, it certainly seemed like it. Their \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So, simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So, what I'm saying is, is let's just meet together.",
      "As a physician, I can tell you, that deductible, the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the x-ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's just meet. Let's address her concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But, of course, they may say that about us. So, what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like, March to get it done because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them and they get reimburse. It happens \u2013 it's what we do in my family. We have a flexible spending account.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so, we can get this done. And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one, and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place.",
      "I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro-life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority.",
      "So, there is \u2013 I am disappointed, as well as others are disappointed, by the way this is being slow-walked. I think \u2013 I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there.",
      "If you want to reassure the American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1 percent of patients. I \u2013 with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated, the slow-walking you say is happening?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation. I can't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, did the FDA commissioners say that?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: The FDA commissioners said that they're trying to get the study together. But they've been in office long enough that it could be. And so, I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more.",
      "I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard. And I think that, in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's more of our exclusive interview with Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the national guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity.",
      "So, from where you sit, is Maduro stepping down enough, or do you need the entire regime dismantled, in which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuelan Opposition Leader): That's a very good question because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other.",
      "There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed. Certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity, that have been reported by the fact finding missions (ph) of the United Nations should face justice. Local justice and international justice.",
      "There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge.",
      "But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represents chaos. We're going to put order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country. That Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China.",
      "Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, and especially wants President Trump to think that. But I would ask you a question. Do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time or does he have something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources? I mean helping a regime that is going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him.",
      "Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the (INAUDIBLE) actors of Tarismo (ph) might be planning to do once we are in that transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats.",
      "And, you know, we work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a transition to democracy and new government \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Some of them, yes. And we believe that over 80 percent of our armed forces will join in support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about that transition. What kind of support do you need to keep the country together, to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we're already working together. Not only in security issues, but power supply, food supply, how do we bring \u2013 you know, put order in our financial accounts. How do we restructure our debt. How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil and gas and infrastructure, critical minerals. I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have.",
      "And, you know, we're located three hours by plane from Florida. So, it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the (INAUDIBLE) shoring process taking place, a better ally in the region than Venezuela.",
      "At the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region is a top priority for all.",
      "So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do, the first 100 hours, and the next 100 days. And most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include U.S. peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I'm \u2013 I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government elect is in place. But the \u2013 we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.",
      "And one thing that you mentioned for \u2013 about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now? Some temporary protected status was just revoked bit the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone and every single citizen will be, you know, living freedom and respect towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners. And everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future of their \u2013 for their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today. And we will be watching.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I thank you and again (ph) for this great opportunity. And God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:45:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she's \"absolutely\" supportive of President Trump's strategy in the country amid his administration's increased pressure campaign against the regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"We, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere,\" Machado said of Mr. Trump on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Venezuelan opposition leader made a daring escape from her country to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. The appearance marked the first time Machado has been seen in public in almost a year, after living in hiding in Venezuela. In an exclusive interview with \"Face the Nation,\" Machado said she dedicated the award to Mr. Trump because \"he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security.\"",
      "\"We have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening,\" Machado said. \"That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.\"",
      "The U.S. has increased pressure on the Maduro regime in recent weeks, with a buildup of military assets in the region, strikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, new sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels, along with the seizure of an oil rig.",
      "Machado acknowledged that more sanctions and more possible seizures of oil come with the risk of cutting off the already impoverished people of Venezuela. But she said \"what we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "\"What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people,\" Machado said. \"A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years.\"",
      "Asked by Brennan whether she wants more seizures and a blockade, Machado said \"we want every legal action through law enforcement approach,\" not only from the U.S., but also from Caribbean, Latin American and European countries to \"further block the illegal activities of the regime.\"",
      "\"Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition,\" Machado said.",
      "Maduro refused to leave after last year's presidential election, even after tallies showed the opposition winning nearly 70% of the vote. But Machado said things have changed significantly in recent months, and Venezuela is a \"total different country.\"",
      "\"Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime,\" she said. \"So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.\"",
      "Outlining her argument, Machado said \"the wide majority of the military want change,\" pointing to the move to disobey an order to expel electoral witnesses from polling stations during last year's elections, and the results of the election itself. Machado said more recently, members of the military have been \"finding ways to connect with us\" by sending messages \"to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.\"",
      "Asked whether she would welcome U.S. military action in Venezuela, Machado said \"I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.\"",
      "Machado alleged that the Maduro regime has \"persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans.\" She added that \"recently it has turned even more violent because, you know, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.\"",
      "The opposition leader said \"we are facing not a conventional dictatorship.\"",
      "\"This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime,\" she said.",
      "Machado said that while \"Maduro is the head of the structure,\" she alleged that it's like \"any other mafia system.\"",
      "\"There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes,\" she said. \"And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order.\"",
      "Asked whether she's concerned Russia will shore up support for the military and intelligence, Machado said \"I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that.\" But she added, \"do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time?\"",
      "\"I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him,\" Machado said.",
      "On the task of keeping the country together after Maduro's regime leaves, Machado cited cooperation with key allies, saying, \"our main ally will be the United States of America.\" On the question of whether that would include U.S. troops on the ground, Machado said she doesn't \"think that's the case.\"",
      "\"There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.\"",
      "Machado said \"the day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, tthat aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, he joins us this morning from Baton Rouge. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51 to 48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114%. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, first Margaret, let's just kind of recast the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing the Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then, frankly, the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient. So I would argue that it actually is- there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums, if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an--",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will, that $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple- for people over 50. Give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19, they would get $5,000 in an account in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now the insurance plan for that couple would be 6000- $6,000 deductible. So- so you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with- come forward- out of your own pocket. By the way, I'm told that about 40% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know the President has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but- but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal too. And I think that shows you that there is- there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out of pocket expense, but also the higher premiums--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But is the White House behind you on this? Like are they helping you?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: --Well it certainly seems like it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So what I'm saying is, let's just meet together. As a physician, I can tell you that deductible- the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the X ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's- let's just meet. Let's address our concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short term extension of the premium tax credits, if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But of course, they may say that about us. So what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like March to get it done. Because with- with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed. It happens- it's what we do in my family, we have a flexible spending account. And so we can get this done, and I think we can meet the concerns both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place. I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority. So there is- I am disappointed as well as others are disappointed. By the way, this is being slow walked. I think- I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there. If you want to reassure American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1% of patients. I- with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated- the slow walking you say is happening?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well, did the FDA commissioner say that?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I can't do that- but the FDA commissioner said that they're trying to get the study together, but they've been in office long enough that it could be and so I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more. I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard, and I think that in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia. Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, let me at the top of the show- we've got this tragic shooting at Brown University, and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia. Both horrible and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is a celebration of light over darkness. And boy, we could use a little more light these days. Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who is a bad guy and saying, and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time, is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running. The president who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who is probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine. I think is- yes, it would be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question, Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We've got troops potentially in harm's way. We've got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats, where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker. I think the President needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they've, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats. Nothing with sovereign territory yet. But that gets to your argument about what is the end goal. Unlike other Democrats when it comes to the drug boats, you've said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You've questioned Admiral Bradley. I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've seen it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I've seen it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--Only a limited number have--",
      "SEN. WARNER:-- It is extraordinarily chilling. What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back, right? And so what I've said--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- I know that. That's why I've said to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw you said this. That's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is where I have a question. The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down till September 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't have the answer. I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you- again- once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world. It's so important. But this President has not- and frankly, Pete Hegseth, even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President said again this week, and I'll just read it to you that land strikes on Venezuela are being considered. Land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people. It doesn't necessarily have to be in Venezuela. It's people that are bringing in drugs to our country as targets. Have you seen any legal justification to hit these people now designated as terrorists on sovereign territory, whether it's Mexico or Colombia or Venezuela?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The vast majority of the drug particularly- this is all cocaine. This is not fentanyl. The vast majority--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- In terms of the drug boats--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- The vast majority is actually in the eastern Pacific, yet most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean. And is- this mean that suddenly you're going to be in open warfare with all of American military against any and all drug dealers? Again, the drug dealers are awful. We need to do all we can to stop them, but the President, when he puts American forces potentially in harm's way, needs to come and explain to American people what the goal is here.\u00a0 Particularly when he's then, at the same breath, pardoning the former president of Honduras, who was a convicted drug dealer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 In terms of designated terrorists, ISIS is a designated terrorist group. We just saw the first combat deaths, essentially, of the Trump administration yesterday. Three Americans killed, three injured in Syria in this apparent ambush. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center said it was an insider attack. Are you supportive of keeping the nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria. Do you have concerns that the Syrian Government isn't able to keep these infiltrators out?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, condolences to the three Americans families, Armed Forces members, one an interpreter. I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, you want them to continue?",
      "SEN. WARNER: But the President- I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the President, again, has sent signals. Months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating his strategy. I mean the President, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean and now potential Venezuela. This has not been an overnight. This buildup of force has been months. He owes it to all of us to come in and explain what his goal is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestically, we have Senator Cassidy on the program. We taped with him earlier. He says he's looking for fellow Democrats to join him in a health care deal by March, to make these health savings accounts, and he said he'll offer to extend the existing subsidies for healthcare premiums. Would you be on board with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, we've got a crisis that hits as of Monday, tomorrow, because that's when people have to sign up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He says retroactively you can do it.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, listen, it's a mess once you've signed up or you've dropped out of the system. You know, the idea that you're retroactively going to fix it. Fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they'll be able to afford healthcare. And the notion- but the notion of what-\u00a0 Bill Cassidy is a good guy. I've worked with him in a lot of different efforts, but the idea that a one time $1,500 payment into your pocket is going to suddenly make up. I had a person the other day. Her current insurance is $544 a month. It'll go up to over $1,500 a month. A one time $1,500 payment is not going to meet her needs, and particularly if that would mean that things like pre-existing condition protections would disappear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like you're not- not on board in these remaining days of 2025 Senator, I have to--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- Fix the crisis right now, extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. Thank you, Senator. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, Venezuelan opposition leader who joins us from Norway where she just received the Nobel Peace Prize. Welcome to 'Face the Nation.'",
      "MAR\u00cdA CORINA MACHADO: Thank you very much, Margaret. It's my pleasure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You face arrest by the Maduro regime. I know you went through extraordinary difficulty just getting out of the country and to Norway. You said you got support from the United States government to do so. Can you tell us what type of support?",
      "MACHADO: Actually, I prefer not to give away any details, because I do not want to increase the risk on men and women that helped me to be here. And the regime has been, you know, very cruel against those that in the past have helped other Venezuelans flee the country when they were persecuted. So in this case, I do prefer to protect them as much as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. The head of the private rescue organization, who said he helped you come out of Venezuela, spoke to my CBS colleague, Lilia Luciano, and said smuggling you out was very high risk because you are so well known. You traveled by land, by sea, by air. He said multiple donors paid for it. Do you know why it was so important to them for you to make it to Norway and receive that prize?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I frankly have no idea. And as I say, I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway. But what am I going to say- how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal, narcoterrorist structure and- and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter. I read you hadn't even seen your daughter in 16 months. That's an incredible sacrifice for anyone. Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MACHADO: Of course, they are concerned as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared, thousands of Venezuelans, and recently it has turned even more violent because, you know when, when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent. Just a couple of weeks ago, a 16 year old girl was kidnapped and taken away to prison just because they were looking for her brother, and since they couldn't find her brother, they took Samantha. So this is the kinds of actions that are currently happening in my country. So yes, my family is concerned, but they know I have said that I will be where I am more useful to our cause, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe it's important to help the cause from inside the country right now. Can you help us understand what is going on, because we are seeing here in the US an increase in the pressure campaign. More sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela. Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy, and we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why, and I say this from Oslo right now, I had dedicated this award to him because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States national security. And we do support these actions, because, Margaret, we are facing, not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, \u00a0the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime. And as every criminal structure is suffers, is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arm smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking. So that's what we believe, it was so important to apply, you know, law enforcement, and we have been asking this for years, so it's finally happening. That's why I believe the regime has its days numbered.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil, but isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MACHADO: Of course. What we're doing is for the well being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives, but Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people. A war we didn't want. A war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And right now, I want to be very clear with the international community, the resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals in Venezuela a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members to spy and infiltrate and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on. So these resources are not going for, to- towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement a- approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries that further block the illegal activities of the regime. Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart, and it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition. Which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by landslide last year, but he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And 8 million Venezuelans have fled\u2013",
      "MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013since he came to power during that time, but in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MACHADO \u00a0 Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialog initiatives, not once, not twice, 17. Every single time the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered, the regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time, they got legitimacy, they got money, and that's precisely what they think they can get again, once again. But certainly, things have changed very much in the last months, Venezuela is total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The Armed Forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive, and we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had ever had a chance to finally move ahead into, towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MACHADO: Well, first of all, we have the evidence that the wide majority of the military want change, and that was- we saw that on July 28, 2024, that the military were ordered to expel our electoral witnesses from the polling stations and to deny our right to the original tally sheets and they disobeyed that order. Even in those polling stations where we know there is a high participation of military, we won by a landslide. More recently, we've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to, to, to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling. When, when they, this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners, saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? Has he promised you anything?",
      "MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case. We are not involved, and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over. And I will insist something that I've said several times before, this is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East, we had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70% of the population, and what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you square military action with receiving a peace prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MACHADO: What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy and democracy, in order to have peace. And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply given in. And that's not the case. It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran and then as a benefit to unknown people, not to ask support from democratic countries and Democratic leaders, that's absolute, absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast, broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the National Guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity. So from where you sit is Maduro stepping down enough? Or do you need the entire regime dismantled? In which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MACHADO: That's a very good question, because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other. There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed, certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity that have been reported by the fact finding missions of the United Nations should face justice, local justice and international justice. There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge. But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represent chaos. We're going to put order. And this whole idea, you know, people talking about a risk of a civil war and so on. Whoever says that has no idea at all about what Venezuela is. I mean, we are certainly the most cohesive society in the region, I would dare to say, perhaps in the world. I mean, Venezuelan society has no religious, social, regional, racial confrontations or tensions on the country. 90% of our population want the same, want the regime to go immediately, and we want to work hard to live with freedom. We want no more socialism, but most of all, we want our children back home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, but respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country, that Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China. Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MACHADO: Well, I'm, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, especially wants President Trump to think that, about that. But I would ask you a question, do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time? Or does he has-something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources. I mean helping a regime that it's going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does. I don't think it's a priority for him. Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the residual actors of Chavismo might be planning to do once we are in a transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats. And you know, we've work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a tran- transition to democracy and the new gov--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MACHADO: Some of them, yes, and we believe that over 80% of our armed forces would join and support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me about that transition. I- we checked and when Secretary Rubio was sworn into office, you were one of the very first phone calls that he made. On day two.",
      "MACHADO: Me and President-elect Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, it was the two of us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's right, that's right, he's deeply interested. So I'm interested in what has been promised to you if and when Maduro and his regime leave, what kind of support do you need to keep the country together to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we are already working together. Not only in security issues but power supply, food supply. How do we bring, you know, put order in our financial accounts? How do we restructure our debt? How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil, in gas, in infrastructure, critical minerals? I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have. And you know, we're located at three hours by plane from Florida. So it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the near-shoring process taking place a better ally in the region than Venezuela. And at the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region, is a top priority for all. So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do the first 100 hours and the next 100 days. But most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people. I mean, this is something that it's- I've heard once, over and over again all analysis leave the people on the side, when that's the most important force that we have right now. That's why we are where we are right now. And the Venezuelan people want to move ahead once we conquered democracy back, would have cost- has cost us so many lives, so many- so much pain, that you will see the country taking care of it. The people will be the main source of stability. But certainly we look forward for- to cooperation with our main allies. And of course, our main ally will be the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include US peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MACHADO: I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government-elect is in place, but that we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government-elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country. And one thing that you mentioned before about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see 10s of 1000s, hundreds of 1000s of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean, our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win, win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now some temporary protected status was just revoked by the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone, and every single citizen will be, you know, leaving freedom and respect in towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners, and everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future, of their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today, and we'll be watching.",
      "MACHADO: I thank you, Margaret, for this great opportunity, and God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "Erika Kirk recalls the emotional fog of Charlie Kirk's assassination, addresses conspiracy theories and takes questions during a CBS News town hall hosted by Bari Weiss.",
    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk transformed the American right through his nonprofit Turning Point USA before he was assassinated at an on-campus event in Utah three months ago. This week, his widow Erika, who now leads Turning Point, joined CBS News for a town hall where she reflected on grief, defended her husband's controversial comments and explained the \"game-time decision\" of publicly forgiving the man accused in her husband's murder.",
      "The conversation, moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, is the first of many planned CBS News town halls and debates. Invited guests who joined the conversation included Utah Valley University student Hunter Kozak, who was the last person to speak to Charlie Kirk, and Robert Milgrim, the father of Israeli Embassy staffer Sarah Milgrim, who was shot and killed in May.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Erika Kirk's message to people who sought to justify assassination: \"Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter\"",
      "Erika Kirk said anyone who sought to justify her husband's assassination is \"sick\" and said the internet has dehumanized people.",
      "\"He's a human being. You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you.\"",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie never incited violence",
      "Charlie Kirk was known for his debates with college students, inviting them to step up to a microphone and \"prove me wrong.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said her husband encouraged people of different political beliefs and backgrounds to come to the front of the line, saying, \"'I'll put my mic down. Tell me why you believe that. That's interesting. I never thought of that. But have you thought of this?'\"",
      "A recent poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and College Pulse found that 91% of undergraduates believe \"words can be violence.\" But Erika Kirk said her husband never incited violence: \"He never once said, 'Go after them because they're saying X, Y, Z and they deserve to die.'He gave them a microphone. He didn't take away a moment for them to speak back. He gave them a microphone. And what'd they do? They gave him a bullet in the neck. Totally different.\"",
      "She says her husband believed having conversations could save the world, referencing his new book, \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" which emphasizes that you can't communicate effectively with someone if you're not at peace with yourself.",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie shouldn't be \"deteriorated\" to \"out-of-context\" clips",
      "Erika Kirk says some of her late husband's controversial comments, shared widely in the wake of his assassination, lacked context and that he should not \"be deteriorated\" to a few sentences.",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about some of those much-shared comments: that some gun deaths are \"worth it\" to protect the Second Amendment; that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake; and that if he sees a Black pilot, he's \"going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified,\" while acknowledging \"that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she'd love for people to watch the full clips instead of taking comments out of context.",
      "\"Charlie didn't care what skin color you were. He didn't care what religion you were. He loved excellence,\" she said, adding that \"his favorite word was 'earn'\u2026 He loved knowing that people worked hard to earn what they got.\"",
      "She said she didn't know the context of the \"gun deaths\" quote but said, \"There's a lot more there than just that one little sentence.\"",
      "\"My husband is not to be deteriorated to two sentences,\" she said. \"He's not. He is a thought leader, and he was brilliant of a man. So that's fine if you want to take words out of his mouth or out of context without the whole thing in perspective, but that's the problem.\"",
      "The last student to talk to Charlie Kirk asks: Will you condemn President Trump's rhetoric?",
      "Kozak was the last person to debate Charlie Kirk before he was shot. Since that day, Kozak \u2014 a self-professed liberal \u2014 has continued to call for civil political discourse. \"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation. I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley after the shooting.",
      "He attended the CBS News town hall, where he again took the microphone \u2014 this time, to ask Erika Kirk a question: \"Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on earth?\"",
      "Kozak specifically referenced President Trump accusing six Democratic lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" and then reposting, \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\" Top Democrats called for Mr. Trump to be \"condemned forcefully\" over the social media remarks.",
      "Erika Kirk didn't mention Mr. Trump by name in her response, saying the issue is \"so much deeper than one person\" and that it \"starts at the home.\"",
      "She urged parents to \"look in the mirror\" and reflect on how they're raising their children.",
      "\"You can choose to have evil in your heart or you can choose to have light,\" she said. \"What you consume and what you absorb from the outside world will manifest itself.\"",
      "Weiss asked: \"Do you think our political leaders have a responsibility to turn the temperature down right now?\"",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk replied. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "Dad of Israeli Embassy staffer killed in shooting asks: Will you condemn antisemitism?",
      "Robert Milgrim, whose daughter Sarah was one of two victims of the Capitol Jewish Museum shooting in Washington, D.C., asked Erika Kirk: \"Will you here condemn the individuals spreading that hate and speak out clearly enough against antisemitism so we can prevent another tragedy?\"",
      "\"Hate is hate. It's evil,\" said Erika Kirk, adding that she and Charlie Kirk have always been \"very clear on our stance\" on Israel and the Jewish people.",
      "She said: \"What healing factor comes out of hating Jewish people? What healing factor comes out of hating Christians? What healing factor comes out? Hate in general. Nothing. Nothing. Charlie always would say very clearly, Jew hate was brain rot. He would always say it.\"",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 900% in the U.S. over the past 10 years, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League audit.",
      "Erika Kirk's one-word message for Candace Owens",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about Candace Owens, a former Turning Point USA employee and onetime friend of Charlie Kirk, who has recently been peddling conspiracy theories about his assassination. Owens has also made unfounded fraud allegations about the nonprofit \u2014 the Treasury Department last week confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk runs are under investigation by the IRS.",
      "What does Erika Kirk want to say to Owens and others making these unfounded claims?",
      "\"Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.\"",
      "The \"game-time decision\" to forgive",
      "Erika Kirk stunned millions when she proclaimed at her husband's memorial service that she forgave her husband's accused killer.",
      "\"I forgive him because it's what Christ did and is what Charlie would do,\" she said in her powerful eulogy.",
      "She told Weiss that the moment was a \"game-time decision\" because she'd never say something she didn't mean.",
      "\"But am I gonna take that moment to say, 'Rally the troops, burn the city down, march in the streets?' Or am I gonna take that moment and unleash something like we talked about, even greater, more powerful and say, 'It's a revival.' And let that unleash, and let the Lord use it in ways that no one else could've ever imagined.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she's not forgetting or condoning, but rather \"releasing myself from the enemy's hands where he could have a foothold in me.\"",
      "When asked if she had any words for his accused killer, she said: \"Nothing. I have nothing to say to you. Nothing.\"",
      "She added that there's a difference between forgiving someone and still wanting justice. \"We serve a just God, and I rest easy in knowing that. He's sovereign, but he's just. And so let the Lord handle that.\"",

      "Three months after her husband, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated, Erika Kirk opened up about life, loss, the state of political discourse and more in a one-hour town hall event moderated by Bari Weiss, CBS News' editor-in-chief. The special was broadcast on Saturday night on the CBS television network and will stream later on Paramount+ and CBS News 24/7.",

      "Erika Kirk is the chairman and CEO of the Turning Point USA. The organization was founded by her late husband, a conservative political activist who was shot and killed on Sept. 10, 2025, while speaking before a crowd on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.",
      "\"Like so many people around the world, I will never forget the moment that Erika Kirk forgave her husband's killer,\" said Weiss. \"I am eager to speak to her \u2014 and thrilled to be doing so in front of a group of Americans who I know will elevate the conversation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday unveiled a new statewide fraud prevention program in the state's latest effort to crack down in the wake of the Feeding Our Future scandal\u00a0\u2014 a scheme that siphoned away $250 million in taxpayer funds meant for hungry children.",
      "Walz, the one-time Democratic running mate to former Vice President Kamala Harris, named Tim O'Malley as the new director of program integrity in a news conference on Friday morning.",
      "O'Malley is former FBI agent who previously led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, appointed by Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He had also served as a chief judge on the state's Court of Administrative Hearings, appointed by Walz, and has worked with the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis in an integrity-related capacity.",
      "\"[O'Malley] will work across state government to strengthen fraud protection and protect taxpayer dollars,\" Walz said. \"Tim made this clear yesterday as we were talking: he does not work for me, he works for the people of Minnesota as all of us do, and in fact he was so clear about that is he wanted to make sure that he rewrote the press release that went out to make sure that it reflects not a reality that we may craft, but the one that's truly there.\"",
      "O'Malley said the governor privately assured him he'd have \"the freedom and autonomy to act to do whatever is necessary to solve this.\"",
      "\"I'm not here to serve any individual, and I'm not here to serve a political party. I'm here to serve Minnesotans,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Walz said the fraud prevention program was built with help from an outside forensics company called WayPoint, led by forensic accountant and attorney Josiah Lamb.",
      "\"In our current capacity, we are working with the BCA to build out this anti-fraud toolkit, which will include policies and procedures specifically designed to address fraud risks, that can be utilized enterprise-wide to help prevent fraud in the future,\" Lamb said.",
      "The governor said the state's contract with the company is valued \"up to $200,000\" and \"will be spread across all the state agencies.\"",
      "Walz says he takes \"responsibility\" for fraud",
      "The Feeding Our Future scandal, the\u00a0nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, has garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration, prompting a surge of federal immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota and fueling the talking points of his Republican gubernatorial challengers.",
      "In response to Walz's announcement on Friday, candidate and current GOP state Rep. Kristen Robbins said the governor's fraud prevention program \"should be his resignation.\"",
      "Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a \"statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.\" Resmusson added that Minnesotans \"expect their government to provide vigorous oversight of our welfare programs.\"",
      "On Friday, Walz said Minnesota's \"generosity\" was \"taken advantage of by an organized group of fraudsters and criminals,\" and he'll \"take responsibility\" for the failures that led to the massive COVID relief funding theft, admitting his office \"should have been keeping Minnesotans more up to speed on what was happening.\"",
      "\"We have and have just like in COVID, just like in every other situation, I take full responsibility for it. I think, and I will acknowledge certainly to Minnesotans and to the press here, I don't think we've done a good enough job of communicating the hard work has been done,\" Walz said.",
      "He also said the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "\"Our goal was to make sure we were moving that money so that people ate, that they were housed, that they had vaccines, but it also opened up the door to relax the guardrails and to have fraud be committed,\" he said.",
      "While taking blame for the fraud scandal, Walz also said his attempt in 2021 to freeze funding for a Feeding Our Future-related organization was thwarted by the courts.",
      "\"I said, 'Don't pay them,' and they said, 'You can't do that, you don't have that authority.' I said, 'Do not pay them, let them sue me.' They did and they won, and we paid them, and then they got caught and went to jail after the fact,\" Walz said.",
      "Walz also defended his COVID policies that critics branded as draconian, leading to multiple \u2014 and ultimately unsuccessful \u2014 lawsuits, including over\u00a0mask mandates.",
      "\"I will not apologize for making Minnesota one of the safest states during COVID,\" he said.",
      "In September,\u00a0Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said alongside the Feeding Our Future case, fraud connected to the state's Housing Stabilization Services and autism services \"has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money.\"",
      "Walz recently announced new audits on up to 14 social programs in Minnesota that officials consider \"high risk\" for fraud. An official at the state Department of Human Services told WCCO the inspector general's office is currently reviewing more than 1,300 reported cases of fraud in those programs, and has recovered some $50 million.",
      "Walz: Trump's targeting of Somalis is \"racially motivated\"",
      "President Trump's recent focus on Somali-American Minnesotans, whom he labeled \"garbage,\" appears to be tied to the Feeding Our Future case.",
      "There are now upwards of 80 defendants in the case, many of whom are of Somali descent, though the group's founder and alleged mastermind, Aimee Bock, is White. So far, 61 people have been convicted, with more investigations underway.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show more than 107,000 people identified as Somali across Minnesota, with more than 80,000 living in the Twin Cities.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" with his administration now investigating whether stolen funds were funneled to the Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab.",
      "And in recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has sent dozens of federal agents to Minnesota, specifically the Twin Cities, as part of \"Operation Metro Surge.\" Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries be reexamined, adding that he would\u00a0end the temporary protected status\u00a0for Somalis in Minnesota.",
      "On Friday, Walz said the president's actions do \"nothing to either address immigration\" or \"fraud.\"",
      "\"The absolute recklessness of doing some of this and the targeting of a specific community, unconscionable,\" Walz said. \"It is very specifically aimed and very racially motivated towards a Somali community that matters greatly here.\"",
      "Walz also applauded comments made by GOP state Sen. Jim Abeler, who recently wrote a letter to Mr. Trump rebuking his statements about Minnesota's Somali community.",
      "\"I'd like to acknowledge that just the basic decency, not a surprise to everybody in here has been, but Sen. Jim Abeler's willingness to stand up, and note that it should be the simplest thing in the world,\" Walz said. \"When the president of the United States calls an entire group of people garbage and our state garbage and a hellhole, to just disavow that, you can still be very conservative.\"",
      "High-end cars, luxury vacations, overseas transfers",
      "Newly released evidence also gives the clearest look yet at how the Feeding Our Future fraudsters blew through hundreds of millions of dollars meant to feed Minnesota children during the pandemic.",
      "CBS News obtained dozens of trial exhibits, and they reveal luxury vacations, high-end cars and overseas transfers, all funded by taxpayer dollars meant to feed kids in need.",
      "Photos and documents show fraudsters booking over-water villas in the Maldives, buying gold jewelry in Dubai and sending stacks of cash overseas.",
      "Some defendants purchased lakefront property in Minnesota, first-class airline tickets and luxury cars.",
      "U.S. Attorney Daniel N. Rosen said it's more evidence that the main driver for the fraud was greed.",
      "\"Massive. Order of magnitude larger than just about any fraud that's ever been prosecuted in the United States,\" he said. \"What we can say from that enormous volume of evidence is that the predominant motive of all of these individuals was their self-enrichment and their self-indulgence. And that's where they spent the money overwhelmingly.\"",
      "There is also evidence of money going overseas, including to China.",

      "But the plan does not include an extension to the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Instead, Republican leaders will allow a vote on an amendment to the plan that would include an extension to those expiring tax credits, according to a GOP leadership aide.",
      "The move is aimed at appeasing\u00a0moderate Republicans who are trying to force votes, through what is known as a discharge petition, on separate pieces of legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms.",
      "An extension has split the party, with those opposed saying the subsidies are rife with fraud and high-income households shouldn't qualify.",
      "Democrats have pushed a three-year extension without reforms \u2014 a nonstarter with Republicans.",
      "The Republican plan released Friday includes a provision to expand association health plans, in which multiple employers band together to purchase coverage and lower the costs of benefits. Another provision would provide funding for cost-sharing reduction payments meant to lower premiums for some Affordable Care Act enrollees. The proposal would also require more transparency from pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.",
      "\"While Democrats demand that taxpayers write bigger checks to insurance companies to hide the cost of their failed law, House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement.",

We are ready to work with anyone in good faith on the other side of the aisle who wants to prevent the Affordable Care Act tax credits from expiring at the end of the month,\" Jeffries said. \"Unfortunately, House Republicans have introduced toxic legislation that is completely unserious, hurts hardworking America taxpayers and is not designed to secure bipartisan support.\"",

    "summary": "Adm. Alvin Holsey relinquished command Friday in a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters after announcing early retirement amid U.S. buildup off of Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "Doral, Florida \u2014 The admiral overseeing U.S. military forces in South America relinquished command Friday, as the U.S. continues its buildup of ships and military assets off Venezuela and carries out strikes against alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We have worked hard and tirelessly to build relationships and understand requirements across the region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey said during a relinquishment of command ceremony at U.S. Southern Command Headquarters on Friday. \"That work must continue across the whole government to deliver at the point of need to respond to shared threats in our neighborhood \u2014 the time is now.\"",
      "Holsey, who has served in the Navy for 37 years, stepped down as the head of U.S. Southern Command after announcing in October he'd retire early, just one year into what is typically a three-year term leading a combatant command. He gave no reason, but at the time, CBS News reported there had been tensions between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over deployment decisions in the Caribbean.",
      "During Friday's ceremony, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine awarded Holsey the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with a citation signed by Secretary Hegseth.",
      "In remarks, Caine thanked Holsey and his whole family, saying, \"know how deeply, deeply grateful we are as a nation and as a joint force for all you've done for us.\"",
      "Holsey transferred his duties to Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Lamar Pettus in the ceremony. Pettus will serve as acting commander of U.S. Southern Command until the Pentagon sends a nomination to the Senate to be confirmed.",
      "U.S. Southern Command has been leading the ongoing strike campaign named \"Operation Southern Spear\" that has destroyed 23 alleged drug boats with military strikes, killing 87 people.",
      "The campaign has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers because of a controversial \"double tap\" strike on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors. The commander who ordered the second strike, Admiral Mitch Bradley of U.S. Special Operations Command, has conducted several briefings in the past two weeks with small groups of lawmakers to walk through his decision. He briefed House Speaker Mike Johnson Thursday, and the House speaker said after the briefing and a review of the strike video said the operation was conducted in a way that was \"entirely appropriate.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Holsey gave a virtual briefing to the chair and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee before officially transferring his duties on Friday. Ranking Member Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CBS News Holsey said it was a personal decision to retire early, and even after the briefing, Reed said that \"we have still, I think, many more questions.\"",
      "It's not just the boat strikes that have piqued Congress' interest. Lawmakers also have questions about why there is an expanding military buildup in the region. The U.S. now has about 15,000 forces in the Caribbean between warships, including the world's largest aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford, and on bases in Puerto Rico. It's the largest U.S. military presence there in decades.",
      "The buildup appears to be part of the Trump administration's ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this week with the support of the military, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. President Trump has intimated that strikes inside Venezuela could be next.",
      "Holsey assumed leadership of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024. During his tenure, the command expanded from roughly 3,500 personnel to nearly 15,000 personnel in direct support of operations in the region, according to a release from U.S. Southern Command that honors Holsey's career.",
      "In the last fiscal year, which ended in September, the command disrupted or seized more than a million pounds of cocaine, worth more than $11.34 billion. The release makes no specific mention of Operation Southern Spear.",
      "Holsey is the latest of over a dozen senior military officers who have either been fired by Hegseth or who retired early since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:46:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",
      "One powerful wind was measured at 60,000 kilometers per second, or 130 million piles per hour, about 20% of the speed of light.",
      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",

      "After moving a safe distance away to a precise point in space, the Soyuz braking rockets fired for four minutes and 42 seconds starting at 11:09 p.m., slowing the ship's 17,100-mph velocity by about 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into Earth's lower atmosphere.",
      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",

      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

    "summary": "Time magazine named \"the architects of AI\" its 2025 Person of the Year on Thursday, calling out tech industry leaders behind the rise in artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "Time magazine is spotlighting key players in the artificial intelligence revolution\u00a0for its 2025 Person of the Year, the magazine announced Thursday. \"The architects of AI\" are the latest recipients of the designation, which for more than a century has been given out on an annual basis to an influential person, group of people or, occasionally, a defining\u00a0cultural theme\u00a0or idea.",
      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",
      "\"And the reason why politicians are looking at it is because parents know something's not right. You know, there is no better judge of what's in the best interest of a child than a parent, right?\"",

    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

The police didn't provide details about what led investigators to suspect Nick Reiner in the deaths, saying only that the investigation revealed he was allegedly responsible. Reiner was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m. Sunday. The police said the case will be presented to prosecutors on Tuesday.",

      "The film, which told the story of a teenager struggling with drug addiction and rehab, was \"loosely based on things Nick went through and his relationship to me and his mother,\" Rob Reiner said in a 2016\u00a0AOL interview alongside his son. \"It was intense. It was difficult at times.\"",
      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi said the FBI and Justice Department thwarted \"what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot\" in Southern California.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that four members of a far-left anti-government group have been arrested and face charges for allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks across Southern California on New Year's Eve.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said that the four people who face charges were members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",
      "An Instagram account for the group's Los Angeles chapter\u00a0says it advocates for \"liberation through decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\" The group does not appear to be particularly well-known: its Instagram account had fewer than 900 followers as of Monday morning, and its Facebook page was followed by just 32 users.",
      "Federal officials said one of the defendants, Carroll, 30, created a \"detailed bombing plot\" in November and provided it to a FBI source. She allegedly worked with Page, 32, to obtain and build the bombs, and to recruit participants for the plan. Essayli said Carroll's \"bomb plot was explicit,\" and included instructions for building the devices and targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.",
      "\"These bombs were to blow up at the same time, on midnight this New Year's Eve,\" said Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. \"The plan stated that the IEDs would be complex pipe bombs. It included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and contained guidance on how to avoid leaving evidence behind that can be traced back to them.\"",
      "Carroll and Page also allegedly discussed plans to target federal immigration agents and vehicles with pipe bombs after the bombings, according to Essayli.",
      "Davis said another individual working with the Turtle Island Liberation Front was arrested by the FBI in New Orleans over the weekend as well. The fifth person is not tied to the plot in California, but is a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front, Davis said.",

      "In \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" Reiner famously featured a brief appearance from his mother, Estelle, who delivered the iconic line, \"I'll have what she's having.\" It was also during the filming of \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" that Rob Reiner first met Michele. In a 2016 interview with AV Club, he said meeting her was what made him change the ending of the movie to have Harry and Sally end up together.",
      "Hollywood, political leaders react",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement Sunday night: \"This is a devastating loss for our city and our country.

      "Former President Bill Clinton said Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television.

Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi called word of the Reiners' deaths \"devastating.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is being held on $4 million bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on Twitter. CBS News has asked the White House if the president has any evidence the Reiners' deaths were linked to their political views.",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:05:00 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Slop,\" which refers to creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content, has landed the title of Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
    "story": [
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \"slop.\" The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it the title of Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\"It's such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. \"It's part of a transformative technology, AI, and it's something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Slop\" was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \"you know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\" Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright infringement.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now - and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \"Franklin\" teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity - but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \"slop\" evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "Positive \"slop\"",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\"They want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It's almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn't seem so intelligent.\"",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\"We like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Merriam-Webster's selection method",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\"Words like 'ubiquitous,' 'paradigm,' 'albeit,' 'irregardless,' these are always top lookups because they're words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \"'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It's used. It's been used for decades to mean 'regardless.'\"",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \" polarization.\"",
      "A fresh edition came out last month that adds over 5,000 new words - a rare step that involves fully revising and reimagining one of its most popular dictionaries.",
      "Runners-up to \"slop\"",
      "Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top words of 2025:",
      "Six seven: The viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It's an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla's 2024 song \"Doot Doot (6 7).\"",
      "\"It's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \"It's all the rage, but it's not a defining term.\"",
      "Performative: The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \" kindness content.\" The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the U.N. General Assembly.",
      "Gerrymandering:\u00a0There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democratic-led California.",
      "\"Touch grass\": The definition of this popular internet phrase is \"to participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\" It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \"describe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\" Barlow said.",
      "Conclave: A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \"con clave\" \u2014 meaning \"with a key\" \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Some learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history's first American pope in May 2025. \"It was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.",
      "Tariffs:\u00a0Originally from Italian and Arabic for \"free of charge,\" the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \"a schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\"",
      "Mr. Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit - a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Lake Char\u00adgog\u00adga\u00adgogg\u00adman\u00adchaug\u00adga\u00adgogg\u00adchau\u00adbu\u00adna\u00adgun\u00adga\u00admaugg:\u00a0Yes, you read that correctly. \"The name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\" the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake's name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",
      "Other dictionaries' top picks",
      "Merriam-Webster's top runner-up was chosen earlier this fall as Dictionary.com's word of the year: the ubiquitous middle-school catchphrase \"67\" \u2014 pronounced \"six seven,\" not sixty-seven.",
      "\"Something that you would have thought would have gone away, it just kept on growing larger and larger, snowballing into kind of like a cultural phenomenon,\" Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, told CBS News.",
      "\"This is really a new generation flexing their linguistic muscles and making a pretty phenomenal impact on the English language,\" Johnson said. \"That's something to be celebrated and cheered,\" he added \u2014 even if it annoys parents and teachers.",
      "Meanwhile, the\u00a0Oxford University Press chose \"rage bait\" as its word of the year for 2025, selected by its lexicographers who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told CBS News partner\u00a0BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",

    "summary": "Daniel Hodges, a D.C. metropolitan police officer, says he's trying to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.",
    "story": [
      "Daniel Hodges thinks of himself as an introvert \u2014 he's soft-spoken and says he's averse to the spotlight. At night, he's a local police officer in Washington, D.C. But during his off-duty hours this year, Hodges has become a unique and very public advocate on Capitol Hill.",
      "He told CBS News he's trying to be a firewall to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol siege.",
      "\"The only thing that will stop me is if people stop lying about Jan. 6 and just acknowledge what the day was and what really transpired,\" Hodges said.",
      "He was among the more than 140 police officers injured while trying to stop the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "With Republicans now in control of the White House and Congress and some in the party downplaying the severity of the Capitol siege, there are limited platforms for victims of the attack to talk about its impact on their lives.",
      "Hodges has become a go-to witness for Democrats in congressional hearings about police safety.",
      "The mission generates some stress and conflict for Hodges. At an October subcommittee hearing in the Senate, Hodges watched as three of his fellow witnesses raised their hands, when asked if they supported President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 attackers, including those who had beaten Hodges. One of the witnesses who raised his hand was a former homeland security secretary during President Trump's first administration.",
      "As the minority in the House and the Senate, Democrats are permitted to call one witness at most hearings, to serve as a \"minority party\" witness who provides a counterpoint to the witnesses called by the majority.",
      "Twice this autumn, Democrats have called on Hodges.",
      "\"The power of Dan Hodges's narrative comes from the self-control he displays,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who is the ranking Democrat of a Senate judiciary subcommittee that called Hodges to testify in October. Welch said Hodges, \"erased any of the legitimate anger he may have had about Jan. 6,\u00a0 to just tell us what happened during the hearing.\"",
      "Democrats argue Hodges' testimony and presence at congressional hearings underscores the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who are making public statements in support of tougher laws or policies to protect police at the same time they're downplaying the attacks on law enforcement officers on Jan. 6.",
      "Welch noted that Republicans declined to ask Hodges any questions or speak to him in the hearing room after the testimony.",
      "\"You have to do an immense amount of intellectual and emotional jujitsu to pretend you didn't hear what Hodges said or acknowledge the reality of what he experienced,\" Welch said.",
      "At a Dec. 3 hearing convened by the House Homeland Security Committee titled \"When Badges Become Targets: How Anti-Law Enforcement Rhetoric Fuels Violence Against Officers,\" Hodges testified that Mr. Trump's mass pardon of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants emboldens and encourages further violence against police.",
      "\"The press release announcing this hearing made it sound like certain participants were going to spend a few hours scratching their heads and pretending to not understand why threats against law enforcement have risen so sharply this year, and I cannot abide such a farce,\" Hodges said in his opening statement.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who called Hodges as a witness for the hearing, said he did so to combat \"pervasive misinformation.\"",
      "Thompson told CBS News, \"Everybody saw Jan. 6 with their own eyes. But Trump has convinced a\u00a0 large percentage of the population that those were not insurrectionists.\"",
      "At an October hearing in the Senate titled \"Politically Violent Attacks: A Threat to Our Constitutional Order,\" Hodges was the sole witness called by Democrats.",
      "\"I am intimately familiar with political violence, as when I fought to defend the United States Capitol and many of your very lives, I was beaten, bloodied, and crushed, with my eye gouged and skull smashed with my own baton,\" Hodges testified.",
      "He criticized Republicans on the panel for not acknowledging the Capitol riot, telling them,\u00a0 \"My colleagues were under attack by a mob.\"",
      "Hodges said Republican members of the panels did not ask him questions about Jan. 6 during the public hearings of the committees, nor did they thank him after the proceedings. Spokespeople for the Republican chairmen of the panels at which Hodges has testified this year did not respond to CBS News requests for comment about Hodges's testimony.",
      "At a House hearing this month in which Hodges appeared as a witness, the Republican chair of the committee opened the proceedings with broader statements about the risk of \"inflammatory rhetoric\" endangering the lives of law enforcement and risking homeland security, including recent rhetoric criticizing federal immigration agents.",
      "Hodges spoke with CBS News as a private citizen, not as a representative of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.",
      "He had testified previously before a national audience, in 2021 at a public hearing of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the causes and impact of the riot.",
      "Mr. Trump's victory in 2024 and his first-day pardons of the riot defendants have triggered criticisms of the administration that it is ignoring \u2013 or rewriting \u2013 the history of the siege.",
      "In issuing the clemency of Capitol riot defendants, the White House said the President's decision\u00a0 \"ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "Hodges acknowledges he also has received threats and menacing amid his public statements.",
      "Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who has attended some congressional hearings to support Hodges, told CBS News, \"Danny has been unwavering and cleared every obstacle he's faced, while continuing to serve.\"",
      "Dunn, who also testified and appeared at hearings of the House Jan. 6 select committee in 2021-22, said, \"Danny's and my mission has been the same. We're seeking accountability and justice against those who were responsible for the worst days of our lives.\"",
      "Hodges told CBS News it will be impossible to convince all Americans about the truth of the impact of Jan. 6 on the police victims. When asked if he's optimistic that the deniers of the violence of the siege will change their minds, Hodges paused before answering.",
      "\"There are still people out there who think the moon landing was fake and that the Holocaust wasn't real,\" he said. \"So you are not going to get 100%.\"",

      "Authorities said that the shooting was reported in the Barus & Holley engineering building a little after 4 p.m. local time. The shooting occurred in a first-floor classroom, Providence Deputy Police Chief Tim O'Hara told reporters. The school said final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting.",
      "Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said in a news conference that eight of the wounded were taken to Rhode Island Hospital in critical condition. The hospital later said in a statement that six of those patients were in \"critical but stable condition,\" one was in critical condition, and another was in stable condition.",
      "In a follow-up news conference late Saturday night, Smiley said that a ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries when they \"learned that they had received fragments from a shooting that had occurred near them.\" That victim did not sustain a gunshot wound and is expected to make a full recovery, Smiley said.",
      "Brown University President Christina H. Paxson told reporters in the second briefing that all the victims, those killed and wounded, were students.",
      "Smiley said that no arrests had been made, and a shelter-in-place was in place for the Brown University area. No weapons have been recovered, O'Hara said. A university alert told students to lock doors, silence phones and stay hidden until further notice.",
      "O'Hara told reporters the male suspect escaped from the engineering building following the shooting. It was unclear how he had entered the building, officials said, but Smiley noted that the outer doors of Barus & Holley were unlocked because the exams were taking place.",
      "\"In a building like that on a weekend, there are a lot of things going on,\" Brown Provost Francis Doyle said. \"Study sessions, student groups meeting, there are research labs in that building. So we don't have detailed knowledge of exactly what was happening, but we're working with law enforcement.\"",
      "Providence police, late Saturday night, released security video of a person believed to be the suspect leaving Barus & Holley. Smiley said that investigators do not yet know if the gunman was a student.",
      "In\u00a0the video, the suspect was wearing dark gray or black clothing and his face was not visible, O'Hara said during the second news conference. The video does not show a firearm. No weapon has been recovered.",
      "Video of person of interest in Brown shooting: pic.twitter.com/fjufQ3MTdC",

    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",

      "Sheina Gutnick said that her father, Reuven Morrison, a 62-year-old Soviet-born member of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Australia, was killed while attempting to stop one of the two gunmen during Sunday's mass shooting, which Australian authorities have called an antisemitic terror attack.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" Gutnick told CBS News in Bondi on Monday, referencing an attempt to stop one of the gunmen that was caught on camera during the attack the previous day.",
      "She said it was her father seen trying to stop one of the assailants after another man, later identified as 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, confronted the suspect and wrestled a gun away from him.",
      "\"I believe after Ahmed managed to get the gun off the terrorist, my father had then gone to try and unjam the gun, to try and attempt shooting.

      "\"As my family was exiting a Hanukkah event in Melbourne we heard news from a friend that there was a shooting happening in Sydney. I immediately felt the biggest pit in my stomach and tried calling my father who did not pick up the phone. I then called my mother and I heard screaming, shouting. She was screaming that there's an active shooter,\" Gutnick said. \"I called her back and she was yelling that he's running, he's running, and then that he has been shot. After a few more attempts of hanging up and calling back, my mother was yelling for medical assistance, screaming for an ambulance, screaming for help, asking for help ... she then advised that he's getting oxygen and hung up the phone.\"",
      "She said she managed to get her mother back on the phone, \"and she was screaming that they had stopped working on him and that he had been covered by a sheet. I was hoping in her hysterical state that she was just being delusional and that wasn't the case.\"",
      "Gutnick said that she believes Australia is no longer a safe country for the Jewish community, and she blamed the country's government, accusing leaders of failing to address a rising tide of antisemitism.",
      "Australian police, \"lay on the ground in the grass covering their heads, untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" Gutnick said, adding her voice to a chorus of criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks aimed at Australia's Jewish residents.",
      "\"Australia's not a home for Jews anymore. It can't be. If we are shot dead while celebrating our religious festival of lights, of pride, of celebrating who we are, and if we can't do that, Australia is not a house for us anymore. We can't be here,\" she added",
      "Morrison had fled the Soviet Union to escape antisemitic persecution five decades ago, Gutnick said, and said she was left with a sense of \"betrayal\" due to the manner of her father's death.",
      "\"He came to Australia because he thought that this would be safe,\" she said. \"This is where he was going to have a family, where he is going to live a life away from persecution.\"",
      "\"And for many years, he did do that \u2014 he lived a wonderful, free life \u2014   until Australia turned on him.\"",
      "\"I feel betrayed by the government. I feel the signs were coming for a long, long time. The warning bells were there, and the government sat doing nothing.\"",
      "\"The Jewish community are hurting today,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters Monday at a memorial on Bondi Beach. \"Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.\"",
      "One of the suspects, a father and son, was killed on Sunday, and the younger man \u2014   who was investigated in 2019 over suspected links to extremism but deemed to not represent a threat \u2014   remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, Albanese said.",
      "\"People's circumstances can change,\" he told reporters before a cabinet meeting on Monday. \"People can be radicalized over a period of time. [Gun] Licences should not be in perpetuity.\"",
      "\"We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said Monday.",
      "Gutnick said that she would remember her father as a hero who \"went down fighting.\"",
      "\"He added so much light into the world. There was no human on Earth you could compare him to. If there was one way for him to go from this Earth, he would be fighting a terrorist. There was no other way he would have been taken from us,\" Gutnick said.",

      "Rabbi Eli Schlanger was lauded on Monday as an \"extraordinary human being,\" as information began to come out on the victims of what Australian authorities have called an antisemitic terrorist attack. Among those killed was another local rabbi, a 10-year-old girl and a man who survived the Holocaust.",

      "\"For the last 10 years, the rabbi has invited me to speak and to convey a message. And this year, for the first time, I didn't attend. I had my oldest daughter's best friend's bat mitzvah, so I was somewhere else,\" he said.",

      "\"The last 24 hours is really, really difficult,\" Kastel told CBS News on Monday. \"You know, losing a brother-in-law, you know, a family member, so I'm directly affected. But at the same time, I've got a role in the community supporting others. It's been really difficult.\"",
      "Kastel lauded Schlanger as \"an amazing young man, a person who was committed to his work.\"",
      "\"He was committed to the community. People loved him. Wherever he went he took real interest in people and people took a real interest in him. He would visit people in hospitals, he'd visit people in prisons, he would teach people, he would teach bar mitzvahs. He would inspire other rabbis with his enthusiasm, his positivity,\" Kastel said.",
      "Grieving residents living in Bondi, a southern suburb of Sydney, came together Monday to lay flowers and mourn the dead following the attack. For Rabbi Kastel, it's that community spirit that's the essence of what Hanukkah symbolizes.",

    "summary": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, was convicted in a landmark national security trial. He faces a possible life sentence.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media mogul and outspoken critic of Beijing, was convicted in a landmark national security trial in the city's court on Monday, which could send him to prison for the rest of his life.",
      "Three government-vetted judges found Lai, 78, guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Lai was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law that was implemented following massive anti-government protests in 2019. During his five years in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, Lai has been convicted of several lesser offenses and appears to have grown more frail and thinner.",
      "Lai's trial, conducted without a jury, has been closely monitored by the U.S., Britain, the European Union and political observers as a barometer of media freedom and judicial independence in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Reading from an 855-page verdict, Judge Esther Toh said Lai had extended a \"constant invitation\" to the U.S. to help bring down the Chinese government with the excuse of helping Hong Kongers.",
      "Lai's lawyers admitted during the trial that he had called for sanctions before the law took effect but insisted he dropped these calls to comply with the law.",
      "But the judges ruled that Lai had never wavered in his intention to destabilize the ruling Chinese Communist Party, \"continuing though in a less explicit way.\"",
      "Toh said the court was satisfied that Lai was the mastermind of the conspiracies and that Lai's evidence was at times contradictory and unreliable. The judges ruled that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Lai's only intent, both before and after the security law, was to seek the downfall of the ruling Communist Party even at the sacrifice of the people of China and Hong Kong.",
      "\"This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications,\" they wrote.",
      "Among the attendees were Lai's wife and son, and Hong Kong's Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen. Lai pressed his lips and nodded to his family before being escorted out of the courtroom by guards.",
      "His verdict is also a test for Beijing's diplomatic ties. President Trump said he has raised the case with China, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government has made it a priority to secure the release of Lai, a British citizen.",
      "The founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily will be sentenced on a later day.",
      "The collusion charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Hearings were set to begin Jan. 12 for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "The Apple Daily, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government and Beijing, was forced to shut in 2021 after police raided its newsroom and arrested its senior journalists, with authorities freezing its assets.",
      "During Lai's 156-day trial, prosecutors accused him of conspiring with senior executives of Apple Daily and others to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades and engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "The prosecution also accused Lai of making such requests, highlighting his meetings with former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2019 at the height of the protests.",
      "It also presented 161 publications, including Apple Daily articles, to the court as evidence, as well as social media posts and text messages.",
      "Lai testified for 52 days in his own defense, arguing that he had not called for foreign sanctions after the sweeping security law was imposed in June 2020.",
      "His legal team also argued for freedom of expression.",
      "Lai's health in focus",
      "As the trial progressed, Lai's health appeared to be deteriorating.",
      "Lai's lawyers in August told the court that he suffered from heart palpitations. After the verdict, lawyer, Robert Pang, said his client is in OK spirits as the legal team studies the verdict.",
      "Before the verdict, his daughter Claire told The Associated Press her father has become weaker and lost some of his nails and teeth. She also said he suffered from infections for months, along with constant back pain, diabetes, heart issues and high blood pressure.",
      "\"His spirit is strong but his body is failing,\" she said.",
      "Hong Kong's government said no abnormalities were found during a medical examination that followed Lai's complaint of heart problems. It added this month that the medical services provided to him were adequate.",
      "Hong Kong leader John Lee said Lai harmed the fundamental interests of the country, calling his intentions malicious.",
      "Steve Li, chief superintendent of Hong Kong police's National Security Department, disputed claims of Lai's worsening health outside the court building.",
      "\"Lai's conviction is justice served,\" he told reporters.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said China expressed firm opposition to the vilification of the city's judiciary by \"certain countries,\" urging those countries to respect the city's legal system.",
      "Before sunrise, dozens of residents queued outside the court building to secure a courtroom seat.",
      "Former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung arrived at 5 a.m., saying she wanted to know about Lai's condition after reports of his health.",
      "She said she felt the process was being rushed since the verdict date was announced only last Friday, but added, \"I'm relieved that this case can at least conclude soon.\"",
      "Verdict denounced",
      "Rights groups, including global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International, criticized the verdict.",
      "\"It is not an individual who has been on trial - it is press freedom itself, and with this verdict that has been shattered,\" said Reporters Without Borders' director general Thibaut Bruttin.",
      "\"The predictability of today's verdict does not make it any less dismaying -- the conviction of Jimmy Lai feels like the death knell for press freedom in Hong Kong, where the essential work of journalism has been rebranded as a crime,\" Amnesty International said, according to French news agency AFP. \"Lai has been jailed simply because he and his Apple Daily newspaper criticized the government.\"",
      "Lai's son Sebastien told a press conference in London, \"It's time to ...make my father's release a pre-condition to closer relationships with China,\" AFP reported.",
      "In 2022, Lai was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison over separate fraud charges involving lease violations, in addition to other cases related to the 2019 protests.",

      "Wayne and Vanessa Miller were at the event at Australia's famous Bondi Beach on Sunday with their two daughters, and they said it was a joyful, peaceful event to celebrate the start of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, until it was shattered by two gunmen firing indiscriminately into the crowd.",
      "\"They were giving out donuts, and there was face painting and there was music, the kids were just having an absolute ball,\" Wayne Miller told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King on Monday.",
      "Then, standing in a line with daughter Capri, Wayne heard what he first thought was a firecracker. Then there was another crack, and he realized it was gunfire.",
      "\"My daughter was in front of me. I just turned, I grabbed her, and I just saw a table and I just dived under this table and I just lay on top of my daughter Capri,\" he recalled. \"I was just lying on top of her, just shielding her.\"",
      "\"The bullets were just going off, people screaming and running and running. About two arm lengths from me, there was a guy shot on the floor who was screaming, 'help, help!'\" Miller recalled.",
      "As rounds flew overhead, his wife called him, and they quickly realized they had lost track of their other little girl, Gigi, in the chaos.",
      "\"Vanessa calls me and says, 'Have you got the girls?' I'm like, 'I've got Capri. I'm on top of Capri. Where's Gigi? Gigi, you're with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' She said, 'No, I'm not with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' And at this stage, I thought, okay, I need to look for her, and I stuck my head out from under the table to look up into the field. And somebody shouted, 'There's gunshots!' I just heard gunshots. And the guy said, Get down, get down, get down. And I just thought, 'I just need to wait and protect my little Capri.'\"",
      "\"It was terrifying,\" said Vanessa. \"I'm screaming and the gunshots are going and I'm trying to run.\"",
      "She said she even tried to grab a police officer's gun at one point, \"to save more lives.\"",
      "\"I've got nothing to lose. I've gotta go, I've gotta go,\" the mother thought. \"I felt hopeless. I looked, I was watching the whole thing. I just see people on the ground. I called my mother and I said, 'Gigi's dead. Gigi is dead, Gigi's dead.' I just knew she was dead \u2026 What does a 3-year-old know? ... You think they're gonna drop to the ground and take cover? No. I just knew she'd be running around screaming. She was an easy target.\"",
      "Wayne eventually found his wife, handed their daughter Capri over to Vanessa, and then set out to look for Gigi.",
      "\"I ran back into the field to look for Gigi, and I was looking amongst the blood and the bodies and I found my little girl lying underneath this beautiful hero, an absolute brave hero, Jess. She was shielding my little baby from the gunshots,\" he told CBS News. \"It was the most special moment of my life to find her, and I took her number and I said, 'Jess, thank you. You're an absolute brave hero. You're an absolute superhero.\"",
      "Vanessa Miller said Jess continued shooting video of the attackers even as she laid down over the Gigi to protect her, \"and you could see the guy on the bridge, shooting at her. Shooting towards her.\"",
      "Miller said she'd asked her husband whether he felt the event was safe just 15 minutes before the attack started, noting what seemed to her to be very few security personnel in the area.",
      "\"There were only two policemen there,\" Vanessa said. \"I didn't feel safe. I said to him, 'I don't feel safe.'\"",
      "The couple were highly critical of Australia's government, accusing officials of having \"done nothing to protect the Jewish communities\" in the country in the face of rising antisemitism.",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "According to data compiled by the council, antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number seen before Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Police officials in New South Wales state said at least 15 people were killed and 40 others remained in local hospitals following what Australian leaders have called an antisemitic attack.",
      "The suspects were a father and son. They had six firearms \u2014 legally owned by the 50-year-old father \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device, all allegedly to target the Jewish gathering, according to Australian authorities.",
      "\"It was ground zero,\" Ben Ferguson, among the emergency responders to reach the scene, told CBS News. \"We were all there, and ended up carrying bodies into the street.\"",
      "Ferguson, a lifeguard at the local Bondi surf club, said members of the club were among the first to provide medical attention to people wounded in the shooting, and he said they started doing so as soon as the gunfire stopped. \"We realized it was a mass shooting event when someone screamed that the gunman was reloading, and then we just knew that we were completely vulnerable.\"",
      "\"There was a really big feeling \u2026 a constant paranoia that a bomb was gonna go off. And we didn't know where the gunmen were,\" Ferguson told CBS News on Monday. \"The Surf club has a lot of medical resources ourselves, and so there was a lot of running over and delivering oxygen tanks.\"",
      "Friends and family pay tribute to slain Rabbi Eli Schlanger",
      "Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CBS News he believes a last-minute decision to not attend the Hanukkah event saved his life.",
      "\"For the last 10 years, the rabbi has invited me to speak and to convey a message. And this year, for the first time, I didn't attend \u2014 I had my oldest daughter's best friend's bat mitzvah, so I was somewhere else,\" he said.",
      "\"The rabbi who invited me, who was a dear dear friend of mine, who I would have been standing next to, was among the slaughtered,\" Ryvchin told CBS News.",
      "The co-CEO paid tribute to Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was one of the organizers of the event, calling him an \"extraordinary human being.\" Ryvchin said Schlanger's work across the state of New South Wales included helping the underprivileged and visiting people hospitalized with terminal illnesses.",
      "Schlanger's brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel, was also at the event with his family.",
      "\"The last 24 hours is really, really difficult,\" Kastel told CBS News on Monday. \"You know, losing a brother-in-law, you know, a family member, so I'm directly affected. But at the same time, I've got a role in the community supporting others. It's been really difficult.\"",
      "Kastel lauded Schlanger as \"an amazing young man, a person who was committed to his work.\"",
      "\"He was committed to the community. People loved him. Wherever he went he took real interest in people and people took a real interest in him. He would visit people in hospitals, he'd visit people in prisons, he would teach people, he would teach bar mitzvahs. He would inspire other rabbis with his enthusiasm, his positivity,\" Kastel said.",
      "Shalom, a 20-year-old man from Miami who has been living in Bondi, told CBS News his friend was still hospitalized on Monday after being shot while near Schlanger.",
      "\"From what I've heard he was with the rabbi and another policeman, and all three of them got shot,\" Shalom said. \"My friend \u2026 he got shot twice, he got shot one in the stomach, came out, went out, and one in the leg.\"",
      "\"We were at the hospital the whole night last night, and we were with him, praying, just being there for him and he was on a breathing tube. They did a surgery and they said it [the bullet] hit one of his bowels and they fixed it up, and said he's stable, thank God,\" Shalom added.",
      "Grieving residents living in Bondi, a southern suburb of Sydney, came together Monday to lay flowers and mourn the dead following the shooting attack.",
      "For Rabbi Kastel, it's that community spirit that's the essence of what Hanukkah symbolizes.",
      "\"We want to shine, we want to light those candles together, we wanna put our arms around each other and really build a proper Australian community where people feel valued, people feel loved, and people feel cared for,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:05:55 -0500",
    "summary": "For the second time in 3 decades, Australian leaders have vowed to respond quickly to a mass shooting with tighter gun ownership laws.",
    "story": [
      "Australian leaders quickly vowed to tighten up the country's laws on firearm ownership in the wake of the deadly gun attack on Jewish people at Bondi Beach on Sunday. Australia has a history of reacting quickly to gun violence with legislation, and many have credited a ban on rapid-fire long guns brought in following a 1996 mass-shooting with sharply reducing death in the years since.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese proposed new gun restrictions, including limiting the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain and reviewing existing licenses over time, just hours after decrying the Bondi Beach massacre as an act of antisemitic terrorism that struck at the heart of the nation.",
      "\"The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws,\" Albanese said after authorities revealed that the older of the two suspected gunmen, who were father and son, had held a gun license for a decade and amassed his six guns legally. Those weapons, including rifles and at least one shotgun, were believed to have been used in the Sunday attack, according to police.",
      "Other government leaders also proposed restricting gun ownership to Australian citizens, a measure that would have excluded the older suspected gunman, who came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa and became a permanent resident after marrying a local woman, according to authorities. Officials wouldn't confirm what country he had migrated from.",
      "His son, who doesn't have a gun license, is an Australian-born citizen.",
      "The government leaders also proposed the \"additional use of criminal intelligence\" in deciding who was eligible for a gun license. That could hypothetically have meant that a 2019 investigation into the son's suspicious associates, confirmed Monday by Albanese, would have disqualify the father from owning a gun.",
      "Christopher Minns, premier of New South Wales, where Bondi, a suburb of Sydney, is located, said his state's gun laws would change, but he could not yet detail how.",
      "\"It means introducing a bill to Parliament to \u2014  I mean to be really blunt \u2014 make it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community,\" Minns said. \"If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons that put the public in danger and make life dangerous and difficult for New South Wales Police?\"",
      "Australia's ban on semi-automatic long guns came after 1996 massacre",
      "The attack was the deadliest shooting in almost three decades in Australia, since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people were murdered.",
      "Just 12 days after that shooting, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm; and initiating a massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The Australian government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law being adopted, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia, incontestable,\" former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the new laws, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades since, there was not a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "\"People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'\" Howard told CBS News. \"And I'd [respond], 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder.'\"",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \" I can say that, because all the surveys indicate it.\"",
      "\"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen,\" he said. \"Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found that Australia still had some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures in the law had yet to be fully brought into force 29 years later, and that others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "However, \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 people had gathered on Bondi Beach on a warm day to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah in Australia. In stark contrast to the joyful energy on the beach, a terror plot was underway, allegedly planned in advance by a father and son who opened fire with rifles into the crowd, with an improvised explosive device at the ready in their car.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the younger suspect had been investigated by the country's primary intelligence agency in 2019 \u2014 reportedly over links to a suspected ISIS cell in Sydney \u2014   but that he was deemed to represent no security threat.",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Sunday's mass shooting \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it was \"designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "Yet the two assailants were allegedly able to fire shots toward the beach for more than five minutes, according to eyewitness accounts. Videos show the gunmen taking their time to aim, shoot and then duck from a bridge near the beach. One video shows a good Samaritan jumping on the back of one of the shooters and wrestling his gun away. Local media reported that the man who intervened, identified as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "\"The first initial reaction wasn't even by police, it was by civilians, which raised a lot of questions about the role of police,\" said Oded Ailam, who worked in Israeli intelligence for two decades and reviewed videos of the attack for CBS News.",
      "Asked about police response time at a news conference Monday local time, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said, \"I respect a person having an opinion, but I've been really clear: Our police responded promptly. Our police respond very promptly. We work closely with the Jewish community. We are very attuned with providing support to the Jewish community.\"",
      "Ailam told CBS News, \"Everything points to this being a preplanned attack that was planned for a significant amount of time. The big question now is if Iran and Hezbollah will be implicated.\"",
      "Australia earlier this year determined a series of previous arson attacks targeting a synagogue and a Kosher food provider had been directed by Iran, and moved to cut diplomatic ties over the incidents.",
      "\"As a matter of principle, Iran condemns the violent attack against civilians in Sydney, Australia,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Sunday on social media. \"Terror violence and mass killing shall be condemned, wherever they're committed, as unlawful and criminal.\"",
      "When asked by reporters about whether Sunday's shooting was an intelligence failure, New South Wales officials waved off the questions and said their priority is keeping the community safe.",
      "The alleged assailants were a father and son duo. U.S. officials told CBS News on Sunday that they were from Pakistan, but Australian authorities later said the son was Australian-born, and they have not confirmed which country the father migrated to Australia from.",

Seven months later an arsonist set fire to the doors of another Melbourne synagogue, the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, forcing the congregation to flee.",
      "Another arson attack was carried out at the kosher food provider Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, also last year.",
      "The attacks on both the Adass Israel synagogue and the food company were determined by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In August, Prime Minister Albanese expelled Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Sadeghi, and three other Iranian diplomats, citing the intelligence assessment concluding that Iran had directed antisemitic arson attacks on Australian soil.",
      "The ECAJ found antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number before Oct. 7, 2023, which is the largest spike of any J7 country between 2021 and 2024. J7 refers to the seven countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel that form the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Argentina and Australia.",
      "The J7 Task Force met in Sydney less than one week before Sunday's attack to discuss the growing security threat to the Jewish community in Australia.",
      "\"This attack is not only the latest in a disturbing series of antisemitic incidents in Australia but also around the globe, including in the United States,\" said Oren Segal, senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence at the Anti-Defamation League. \"And these incidents are becoming increasingly violent.\"",

    "story": [
      "An attack targeting a Jewish gathering at a famous Australian beach on Sunday killed at least 15 people, including a 12-year-old, government officials and police said. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including two officers and three children.",
      "Police said on Monday that two gunmen \u2014 a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son \u2014 had opened fire at Bondi Beach while the local Jewish community was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. The 50-year-old gunman died, while his son was remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police. Police previously said the deceased gunman was the son, but Lanyon later clarified that the father was shot and killed by police.",
      "Officials had told CBS News on Sunday that Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "Albanese confirmed on Monday that Akram had been investigated for about six months during 2019 by the country's primary intelligence agency. National public broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the probe was over suspected links to an alleged ISIS cell in Sydney. Albanese said the investigation had determined that Akram posed no apparent threat to public safety.",
      "New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said a 12-year-old child was among those killed in the attack. Three other children are being treated in the hospital, he said.",
      "\"This is absolutely horrendous for the community broadly, but particularly the Jewish community. ... What we saw last night was the worst of humanity, but at the same time, the very best of humanity,\" Park said.",
      "Officials have not identified the victims of the attack, although the international organization Chabad, which represents a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said that one of its rabbis, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. He called the attack a \"terrorist incident\" and said the perpetrators used \"long arms,\" referring to long guns such as shotguns or rifles, to carry it out.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Albanese also characterized the attack as targeted, with Minns saying it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\" The prime minister said it was \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\"",
      "\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations, and it is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,\" Albanese said during a news conference on Monday morning local time.",
      "Lanyon said police believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside a vehicle at Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, which they discovered shortly after the shooting occurred. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "International leaders have publicly condemned the attack.",
      "\"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Australia targeting a Jewish celebration,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in\u00a0a social media post. \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio's statement echoed others from officials in Israel, New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom and a number of European countries who similarly spoke out to denounce antisemitism and share their condolences after the shooting.",
      "King Charles also addressed the shooting in a statement, in which the monarch said he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah event.",
      "\"In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve,\" he said in the statement, adding that Australia's \"spirit of community and love ... will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.\"",
      "Gunman disarmed by bystander, video shows",
      "Images and video footage have emerged from the scene of the attack, showing the injured being wheeled away on stretchers by first responders.",
      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then. In July, an arsonist set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, another major Australian city, seven months after a different synagogue in the same city was burned by criminals in a blaze that injured one worshipper.",
      "This article has been updated to reflect that the younger suspect in the shooting was Australian-born, according to authorities in the country.",

      "The 50-year-old father was shot and killed by police, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the 24-year-old son remained hospitalized in a coma.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said Sunday, without going into further details.",
      "During an earlier news conference, Australian police said they were looking for a potential third suspect, but Lanyon later confirmed that was no longer the case. \"I can say that we are not looking for a further offender,\" he said.",

      "The temple of King Nyuserre is believed to be from the Fifth Dynasty and the remains were found in the Abusir necropolis south of the Egyptian capital.",
      "It is part of a monumental complex dedicated to the cult of the sun god Ra and is one of the few solar temples identified to date.",
      "The site was identified as early as 1901 by the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt --known for his 1912 discovery of the famous bust of ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti -- but a high water table prevented any excavation at the time.",
      "According to the ministry, the mission has uncovered for the first time more than half of the temple, long buried under River Nile sediment.",
      "The ministry described a colossal structure of over 1,000 square meters \"with a unique architecture that ranks it among the largest and most remarkable valley temples in the Memphis necropolis\", a stretch of ancient funerary complexes.",

      "\"Today we are celebrating, actually, the finishing and the erecting of these two colossal statues,\" Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.",
      "Ismail said the colossi are of great significance to Luxor, a city known for its ancient temples and other antiquities. They're also an attempt to \"revive how this funerary temple of king Amenhotep III looked like a long time ago,\" Ismail said.",
      "Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs, ruled during the 500 years of the New Kingdom, which was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt. The pharaoh, whose mummy is showcased at a Cairo museum, ruled between 1390\u20131353 BC, a peaceful period known for its prosperity and great construction, including his mortuary temple, where the Colossi of Memnon are located, and another temple, Soleb, in Nubia.",
      "The colossi were toppled by a strong earthquake in about 1200 BC that also destroyed Amenhotep III's funerary temple, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "They were fragmented and partly quarried away, with their pedestals dispersed. Some of their blocks were reused in the Karnak temple, but archaeologists brought them back to rebuild the colossi, according to the Antiquities Ministry.",
      "In late 1990s, an Egyptian German mission, chaired by German Egyptologist Hourig Sourouzian, began working in the temple area, including the assembly and renovation of the colossi.",
      "\"This project has in mind \u2026 to save the last remains of a once-prestigious temple,\" she said.",

      "A fruit shop owner who risked his life to disarm one of the gunmen during an antisemitic terror attack in Australia's Bondi Beach is being hailed a hero for his actions.",
      "Authorities said two gunmen, a 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son, killed at least 15 people and wounded many more during a Hanukkah celebration at the famous Sydney beach. The 50-year-old gunman was also killed and the 24-year-old was hospitalized in \"serious condition,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said.",
      "Following the deadly shooting on Sunday, videos emerged on social media that showed a man crouched behind a parked car along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. One video\u00a0shows him jump up and tackle one of the suspects, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "The man, who local Australian media identified as 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, then wrestles the gun away and points it at the gunman, who backs away.",
      "Local outlet 7News reported that al Ahmed suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "The outlet spoke to a man called Mustapha, who said he was his cousin.",
      "\"He's in hospital and we don't know exactly what's going on inside,\" he said.",
      "\"We do hope he will be fine. He's a hero 100%,\" he said.",
      "The startling footage of the encounter has gone viral, and Ahmed was feted online for his bravery and lifesaving quick thinking, with many people saying he likely saved several lives.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns hailed al Ahmed a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "\"In all of this evil, in all of this sadness, there are still wonderful, brave Australians that are prepared to risk their lives to help a complete stranger,\" Minns told a press briefing late Sunday.",
      "U.S. President Trump, during an event at the White House on Sunday, said the man's actions \"saved a lot of lives.\"",
      "\"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" Mr. Trump said, adding the man \"is right now in the hospital, pretty seriously wounded.\"",

    "summary": "Officials said 15 people were shot and killed Sunday in a targeted attack on a Jewish holiday celebration, to mark the start of Hanukkah, in Australia's Bondi Beach.",
    "story": [
      "Officials said 15 people are dead after gunmen targeted the attendees of a Jewish community event\u00a0on Sunday in Australia's Bondi Beach. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a child and two officers, according to police. Two of the suspects were identified as a father and a son, according to Mal Lanyon, the police commissioner of New South Wales.",
      "The 50-year-old father was killed, and the son \u2014 identified as 24-year-old Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police \u2014 was in custody in critical but stable condition, Lanyon said.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" Lanyon said in a separate update Sunday, but didn't go into further details.",
      "Australian officials and international leaders have condemned it as an antisemitic terrorist attack.",
      "Police said they expect the death toll to climb. Here is what we know so far.",
      "Gunfire broke out at a Hanukkah celebration",
      "The attack took place during a Jewish holiday celebration held to mark the first day of Hanukkah. More than 1,000 people were on the beach, in a suburb of Sydney, when shots rang out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon, who officially declared the shooting a \"terrorist incident.\"",
      "Numerous Australian officials have characterized the shooting as targeted. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah \u2014 which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith \u2014 an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism, that has struck the heart of our nation,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Video footage recorded by civilians showed frightened crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area as gunshots went off in the background.",
      "Neither officials nor police have identified the victims of the attack. Chabad, a global organization representing a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said Rabbi Eli Schlanger, with Chabad of Bondi, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, according to the organization.",
      "2 suspects identified as father and son",
      "Australian authorities said two gunmen were suspected of carrying out the deadly mass shooting, a rare occurrence in a country where gun violence is uncommon.",
      "Lanyon said the deceased suspect was previously known to the New South Wales police force. In addition to the 50-year-old gunman killed at the scene of the attack, another was hospitalized with serious injuries, he said. The surviving gunman, the 24-year-old son, has been taken into custody. The commissioner later said officers were not looking for an additional suspect.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police.",
      "Six licensed firearms were found at the scene, Lanyon said, adding that they all belong to the father. The police commissioner added that the older suspect had a gun licence for about ten years. The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon said.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" he said.",
      "A man has been lauded as a hero and praised by the police commissioner for tackling one suspect and disarming him in dramatic video footage recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that wraps around Bondi Beach. In the footage, the man could be seen crouched in hiding behind a parked car before wrestling the suspect and taking his weapon.",
      "Australian news outlets have identified the man seen disarming the suspect as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, citing his relatives.",
      "Officers found explosive devices",
      "Shortly after the shooting took place, officers who responded to the scene discovered a vehicle along Campbell Parade and believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside of it, Lanyon said. The vehicle was linked to the deceased gunman, according to the police commissioner. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Although Australia rarely experiences mass shootings, after implementing stringent gun reform laws in the wake of a deadly 1996 massacre in Tasmania's Port Arthur, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise in the country since the war in Gaza began in 2023.",
      "The Australian government appointed special envoys in 2024 to address spiking antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, in its communities. But attacks still happened this year. One, in July, involved an arsonist who set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, while worshippers were inside.",
      "World leaders react",
      "The attack on Bondi Beach drew widespread condemnation from leaders across the globe.",
      "In the U.S., Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke out against antisemitism in\u00a0a social media post, which said: \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio joined officials from numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, India, Qatar and Pakistan, who similarly shared remarks expressing sympathy for the victims and solidarity with Jewish communities, as well as denouncing antisemitism.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the officials in his country who responded publicly to the attack in Australia. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by his office, Netanyahu criticized Albanese for supporting a Palestinian state and said such support fuels antisemitism.",
      "\"Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire,\" Netanyahu's statement read, quoting a letter that the Israeli prime minister said he wrote to Albanese in August. \"It rewards Hamas terrorists. It emboldens those who menace Australian Jews and encourages the Jew hatred now stalking your streets.\"",
      "The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group and charity organization, said the attack \"comes after repeated warnings, including from the Australian Jewish community itself,\" adding that \"allowing antisemitic rhetoric and demonstrations to go unchecked can\u2014and does\u2014lead to violence and death.\"",

    "story": [
      "A JetBlue flight from the small Caribbean nation of Cura\u00e7ao halted its ascent to avoid colliding with a U.S. Air Force refueling tanker on Friday, and the pilot blamed the military plane for crossing his path, \u00a0according to a recording of the pilot's conversation with air traffic control.",
      "\"We almost had a midair collision up here,\" the JetBlue pilot said on the recording. \"They passed directly in our flight path. ... They don't have their transponder turned on, it's outrageous.\"",
      "It's unclear how close the planes got because, according to Flightradar24, which tracks real-time aircraft flight data, and the pilot, the American military tanker was flying without its transponder on. Transponders are devices that give information to air traffic controllers about an airplane's location.",
      "The incident involved JetBlue Flight 1112 from Cura\u00e7ao, which is just off the coast of Venezuela, en route to New York City's JFK airport. It comes as the U.S. military has stepped up its drug interdiction activities in the Caribbean and is also seeking to\u00a0increase pressure on Venezuela's government.",
      "\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us within 5 miles of us \u2014 maybe 2 or 3 miles \u2014 but it was an air-to air-refueler from the United States Air Force and he was at our altitude,\" the pilot said. \"We had to stop our climb.\" The pilot said the Air Force plane then headed into Venezuelan air space.",
      "Derek Dombrowski, a spokesman for JetBlue, said Sunday: \"We have reported this incident to federal authorities and will participate in any investigation.\" He added, \"Our crewmembers are trained on proper procedures for various flight situations, and we appreciate our crew for promptly reporting this situation to our leadership team.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an Air Force spokesperson said the military branch is aware of the incident and is currently reviewing the matter.",
      "\"Military aircrews are highly trained professionals who operate in accordance with established procedures and applicable airspace requirements,\" the spokesperson said. \"Safety remains a top priority, and we are working through the appropriate channels to assess the facts surrounding the situation.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration\u00a0last month issued a warning\u00a0to U.S. aircraft urging them to \"exercise caution\" when in Venezuelan airspace, \"due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian, U.S. and European officials will hold a series of meetings.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday voiced readiness to drop his country's bid to join NATO in exchange for Western security guarantees, but rejected the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia as he held talks with U.S. envoys on ending the war.",
      "Zelenskyy\u00a0sat down with U.S. President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. The Ukrainian leader posted pictures of the negotiating table with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting next to him, facing the U.S. delegation.",
      "Responding to journalists' questions in audio clips on a WhatsApp group chat, Zelenskyy emphasized the need for Ukraine to receive firm guarantees from the United States and European allies that would be similar to those offered to NATO members, after the U.S. and some European countries stonewalled Ukraine's bid to join the military alliance.",
      "\"These security guarantees are an opportunity to prevent another wave of Russian aggression,\" he said. \"And this is already a compromise on our part.\"",
      "Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control among the key conditions for peace, a demand rejected by Kyiv.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the U.S. had floated an idea for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk and create a demilitarized free economic zone there, a proposal he rejected as unworkable.",
      "\"I do not consider this fair, because who will manage this economic zone?\" he said. \"If we are talking about some buffer zone along the line of contact, if we are talking about some economic zone and we believe that only a police mission should be there and troops should withdraw, then the question is very simple. If Ukrainian troops withdraw 5\u201310 kilometers, for example, then why do Russian troops not withdraw deeper into the occupied territories by the same distance?\"",
      "Zelenskyy described the issue as \"very sensitive\" and insisted on a freeze along the line of contact, saying that \"today a fair possible option is we stand where we stand.\"",
      "Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told the business daily Kommersant that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of the Donetsk region even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.",
      "Ushakov warned that a search for compromise could take a long time, noting that the U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \"worsened\" by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.",
      "Speaking to Russian state TV in remarks broadcast Sunday, Ushakov said that \"the contribution of Ukrainians and Europeans to these documents is unlikely to be constructive,\" warning that Moscow will \"have very strong objections.\"",
      "Ushakov added that the territorial issue was actively discussed in Moscow when Witkoff and Kushner met with Putin earlier this month. \"The Americans know and understand our position,\" he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday just before the talks with Mr. Trump's envoys, thanking him on X for his support and adding that \"we are coordinating closely and working together for the sake of our shared security.\"",
      "Macron vowed on X that \"France is, and will remain, at Ukraine's side to build a robust and lasting peace \u2014 one that can guarantee Ukraine's security and sovereignty, and that of Europe, over the long term.\"",
      "Merz, who has spearheaded European efforts to support Ukraine alongside Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Saturday that \"the decades of the 'Pax Americana' are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well.\"",
      "He warned that Putin's aim is \"a fundamental change to the borders in Europe, the restoration of the old Soviet Union within its borders.\"",
      "\"If Ukraine falls, he won't stop,\" Merz warned on Saturday during a party conference in Munich.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, tthat aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, he joins us this morning from Baton Rouge. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51 to 48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114%. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, first Margaret, let's just kind of recast the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing the Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then, frankly, the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient. So I would argue that it actually is- there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums, if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an--",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will, that $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple- for people over 50. Give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19, they would get $5,000 in an account in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now the insurance plan for that couple would be 6000- $6,000 deductible. So- so you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with- come forward- out of your own pocket. By the way, I'm told that about 40% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know the President has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but- but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal too. And I think that shows you that there is- there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out of pocket expense, but also the higher premiums--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But is the White House behind you on this? Like are they helping you?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: --Well it certainly seems like it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So what I'm saying is, let's just meet together. As a physician, I can tell you that deductible- the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the X ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's- let's just meet. Let's address our concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short term extension of the premium tax credits, if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But of course, they may say that about us. So what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like March to get it done. Because with- with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed. It happens- it's what we do in my family, we have a flexible spending account. And so we can get this done, and I think we can meet the concerns both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place. I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority. So there is- I am disappointed as well as others are disappointed. By the way, this is being slow walked. I think- I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there. If you want to reassure American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1% of patients. I- with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated- the slow walking you say is happening?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well, did the FDA commissioner say that?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I can't do that- but the FDA commissioner said that they're trying to get the study together, but they've been in office long enough that it could be and so I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more. I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard, and I think that in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're now joined by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia. Senator, were you persuaded there by Maria Corina Machado's argument that military action pressure is virtuous and necessary?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, let me at the top of the show- we've got this tragic shooting at Brown University, and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia. Both horrible and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is a celebration of light over darkness. And boy, we could use a little more light these days. Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who is a bad guy and saying, and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time, is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running. The president who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who is probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine. I think is- yes, it would be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question, Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We've got troops potentially in harm's way. We've got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats, where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker. I think the President needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they've, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats. Nothing with sovereign territory yet. But that gets to your argument about what is the end goal. Unlike other Democrats when it comes to the drug boats, you've said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You've questioned Admiral Bradley. I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've seen it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I've seen it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--Only a limited number have--",
      "SEN. WARNER:-- It is extraordinarily chilling. What I'm saying is, once you make the accusation of war crime, you can't take that back, right? And so what I've said--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But many of your Democrat colleagues have.",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- I know that. That's why I've said to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I want to see the written execution order. I want to see the legal opinion that was about this specific strike. I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw you said this. That's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is where I have a question. The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down till September 5.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't have the answer. I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you- again- once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world. It's so important. But this President has not- and frankly, Pete Hegseth, even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President said again this week, and I'll just read it to you that land strikes on Venezuela are being considered. Land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people. It doesn't necessarily have to be in Venezuela. It's people that are bringing in drugs to our country as targets. Have you seen any legal justification to hit these people now designated as terrorists on sovereign territory, whether it's Mexico or Colombia or Venezuela?",
      "SEN. WARNER: The vast majority of the drug particularly- this is all cocaine. This is not fentanyl. The vast majority--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- In terms of the drug boats--",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- The vast majority is actually in the eastern Pacific, yet most of the strikes have been in the Caribbean. And is- this mean that suddenly you're going to be in open warfare with all of American military against any and all drug dealers? Again, the drug dealers are awful. We need to do all we can to stop them, but the President, when he puts American forces potentially in harm's way, needs to come and explain to American people what the goal is here.\u00a0 Particularly when he's then, at the same breath, pardoning the former president of Honduras, who was a convicted drug dealer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 In terms of designated terrorists, ISIS is a designated terrorist group. We just saw the first combat deaths, essentially, of the Trump administration yesterday. Three Americans killed, three injured in Syria in this apparent ambush. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center said it was an insider attack. Are you supportive of keeping the nearly 1,000 US troops in Syria. Do you have concerns that the Syrian Government isn't able to keep these infiltrators out?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, condolences to the three Americans families, Armed Forces members, one an interpreter. I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, you want them to continue?",
      "SEN. WARNER: But the President- I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the President, again, has sent signals. Months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating his strategy. I mean the President, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean and now potential Venezuela. This has not been an overnight. This buildup of force has been months. He owes it to all of us to come in and explain what his goal is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestically, we have Senator Cassidy on the program. We taped with him earlier. He says he's looking for fellow Democrats to join him in a health care deal by March, to make these health savings accounts, and he said he'll offer to extend the existing subsidies for healthcare premiums. Would you be on board with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: First of all, we've got a crisis that hits as of Monday, tomorrow, because that's when people have to sign up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He says retroactively you can do it.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, listen, it's a mess once you've signed up or you've dropped out of the system. You know, the idea that you're retroactively going to fix it. Fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they'll be able to afford healthcare. And the notion- but the notion of what-\u00a0 Bill Cassidy is a good guy.

Her current insurance is $544 a month. It'll go up to over $1,500 a month.

    "summary": "The military said it killed Raed Saad, described as one of the architects of the Oct. 7 attack, after an explosive device detonated and wounded two soldiers.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's military said it killed a top Hamas commander in Gaza who it described as one of the architects of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the\u00a0two-year-long war.\u00a0 The military said it killed Raed Saad after an explosive device detonated and wounded two soldiers in the territory's south.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas confirmed Saad's death, saying he was the commander of its military manufacturing unit. Israel had described him as an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war in Gaza, and asserted that he had been \"engaged in rebuilding the terrorist organization\" in a violation of the ceasefire that took effect two months ago.",
      "Hamas said the strike that killed Saad was a \"blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\" It also said it had named a new commander but did not give details.",
      "An Israel Defense Forces official asserted that Israel did not violate the ceasefire agreement because, under the deal, the military is permitted to strike targets actively engaged in terrorism.",
      "\"Hamas has been blatantly violating the ceasefire agreement and is failing to uphold its obligations,\" the military official said. \"Day after day, Hamas terrorists breach the ceasefire agreement, crossing the yellow line, threatening the lives of IDF soldiers operating in the authorized areas, and moreover undermining the ongoing efforts to maintain stability.\"",
      "The Israeli strike west of Gaza City killed four people, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw their bodies arrive at Shifa Hospital. Another three were wounded, according to Al-Awda hospital.",
      "Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations.",
      "Israeli airstrikes and shootings in Gaza have killed at least 386 Palestinians since the ceasefire took hold, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has said recent strikes are in retaliation for militant attacks against its soldiers, and that troops have fired on Palestinians who approached the \"Yellow Line\" between the Israeli-controlled majority of Gaza and the rest of the territory.",
      "Israel has demanded that Palestinian militants return the remains of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, from Gaza and called it a condition of moving to the second and more complicated phase of the ceasefire. That lays out a vision for ending Hamas' rule and seeing the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision.",
      "The initial Hamas-led 2023 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Of the hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Israel's two-year campaign in Gaza has killed more than 70,650 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-led Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count.",
      "Much of Gaza has been destroyed and most of the population of over 2 million has been displaced. Humanitarian aid entry into the territory continues to be below the level set by the ceasefire terms, and Palestinians who lost limbs in the war face a shortage of prosthetic limbs and long delays in medical evacuations.",

      "\"Their mission was in support of on-going counter-ISIS / counter-terrorism operations in the region,\" he said, adding that the soldiers' names, as well as identifying information about their units, will be withheld until 24 hours after the next of kin notification. \"This attack is currently under active investigation.\"",
      "U.S. Central Command said the attack was a \"result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria,\" and that the \"gunman was engaged and killed.\"",
      "The shooting took place near Palmyra, according to Syria's state-run SANA news agency, which said two members of Syria's security force were wounded. Additional information on their condition was not immediately available.",
      "No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters outside the White House before departing for the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, said the three service members wounded \"seem to be doing well.\"",
      "\"We mourn the loss of three great patriots in Syria,\" he said, adding: \"Syria was fighting along with us. The president of Syria is devastated. This is an ISIS attack. We mourn the loss. We pray for their parents and loved ones.\"",

    "story": [
      "Divers have discovered a long-submerged wall some 7,000 years old under the sea off western France, scientists said Thursday.",
      "Nearly 400 feet long, it was found off the Ile de Sein in Brittany along with a dozen smaller manmade structures from the same period.",
      "\"This is a very interesting discovery that opens up new prospects for underwater archaeology, helping us better understand how coastal societies were organized,\" Yvan Pailler, professor of archaeology at the University of Western Brittany, told AFP.",
      "He co-authored a study on the find, published in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.",
      "The structures were first spotted by retired geologist Yves Fouquet in 2017 on charts of the ocean floor produced with a laser system.",
      "The wall is the biggest underwater construction ever found in France, BBC News reported.",
      "Divers explored the site between 2022 and 2024 and confirmed the presence of the granite structures.",
      "\"Archaeologists did not expect to find such well-preserved structures in such a harsh setting,\" Fouquet said.",
      "Dating from between 5,800 and 5,300 BC, they lie nine meters underwater and were built at a time when sea levels were much lower than today.",
      "Researchers believe they may have been fish traps built on the foreshore, or walls to protect against rising seas.",
      "The study says the structures reflect \"technical skills and social organization sufficient to extract, move and erect blocks weighing several tons, similar in mass to many Breton megaliths,\" large stone arrangements used as monuments or for ceremonial purposes.",
      "This technical know-how would predate the first megalithic constructions by several centuries.",
      "The study's authors speculate the site may lie at the origin of local Breton legends of sunken cities, according to BBC News. One such lost city \u2013 Ys \u2013 was believed to lie in the Bay of Douarnenez, just a few miles to the east.",
      "\"It is likely that the abandonment of a territory developed by a highly structured society has become deeply rooted in people's memories,\" the study says. \"The submersion caused by the rapid rise in sea level, followed by the abandonment of fishing structures, protective works, and habitation sites, must have left a lasting impression.\"",

Cowell went on to create the massively successful franchises \"The X Factor\" and \"Got Talent\" and helped launch the careers of major artists through his company Syco Entertainment.",

      "\"When someone's not great, the audience is very quiet,\" Cowell continued. \"When an act is fantastic, it can either get really loud or you have that perfect silence. So I've always learned to read an audience. Or certainly when you've got people around you. So when I was auditioning on the show, we had a lot of people in the room with us. And when someone did walk in, the whole energy changed.\"",
      "Over the years, Cowell has helped transform previously unknown singers into global stars.

      "Cowell has previously said that he believes that the contestants are better served by brutal honesty rather than sugar-coated feedback or unearned praise. During his interview with Fox News Digital, Cowell reflected on how he approached interactions with contestants after failed auditions.",
      "\"If I get to see them afterwards, I will go and talk to them and tell them why I didn't like them,\" he said. \"Sometimes I can give them advice. I mean that there are times \u2014 I'm not gonna lie \u2014 where people come in and I'm thinking, 'Wow, I just don't see this happening to you because you're not singing well. I don't think singing lessons are gonna help.' And sometimes you've got to give people a different steer in life.\"",
      "\"I'm a great believer \u2014 you just don't bulls--- people,\"Cowell continued. \"I've learned that on a personal level when I was starting up in the music business. You know, it was tough, you know, and I kind of learnt to do my job well because people fortunately were the same with me. They were very, very, very blunt with me and told me whether I was doing something good or bad. And that's the way you learn. And that's when I decided eventually that I was gonna be on camera after doing this, I was like, 'Well, I'm not gonna lie to anyone. I've gotta be honest with them. Some people will appreciate it, other people not so much.'\"",

    "summary": "Discover why chronic lateness stems from psychology, ADHD and &quot;time blindness.&quot; An expert reveals underlying causes and strategies to overcome persistent tardiness.",
    "story": [
      "ADHD and Executive Function Coach Brooke Schnittman on what is behind more adult women being diagnosed with ADHD and the impact of technology and social media",
      "Chronic lateness is known to be a common annoyance, often leading to strain within relationships, experts have confirmed.",
      "And for some people who struggle to be on time, the reasons may go far beyond poor planning.",
      "Psychotherapist and author Jonathan Alpert told Fox News Digital that chronic lateness often stems from a combination of psychological patterns and neurobiological factors that people may not realize are influencing them.",
      "ALWAYS RUNNING LATE? A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION COULD BE TO BLAME, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"For some people, it's personality-driven. They're distractible, optimistic about how long things take, or simply not tuned into the impact on others,\" the New York-based expert said.",
      "For others, the issue stems from neurobiological differences that affect how the brain manages time.",
      "Chronic lateness may not stem from poor planning, but from psychological and neurobiological factors. (iStock)",
      "That can make it harder to estimate how long tasks take or to transition from one activity to the next, leading to chronic lateness, according to Alpert.",
      "Impact on relationships",
      "In addition to disrupting schedules, chronic lateness may also strain relationships and create tension.",
      "\"Lateness erodes trust. Over time, it sends the message that someone else's time is less important, even if that's not the intent,\" Alpert noted.",
      "7 SIGNS YOU MIGHT HAVE ADHD AND WHAT STEPS TO TAKE",
      "Lateness can also become an issue in the workplace, where repeated delays can undermine teamwork and harm a person's reputation.",
      "These patterns are common among people with ADHD, who often experience what is known as \"time blindness,\" making it difficult to recognize how quickly minutes pass or how long tasks truly take.",
      "\"Adding 10 to 15 minutes of buffer between activities reduces the frantic rushing that leads to chronic lateness.\"",
      "ADHD is strongly associated with executive-function difficulties, which are the skills needed to stay organized, plan ahead and focus on essential details, according to the Attention Deficit Disorder Association.",
      "When these abilities are weaker, it becomes more challenging to gauge time, follow a schedule and meet deadlines, which can impact personal and professional relationships, experts agree.",
      "Frequent tardiness in a work setting can throw off group efforts and leave others with a negative impression of the employee. (iStock)",
      "Underlying patterns",
      "Anxiety, avoidance and perfectionism are patterns that Alpert most often sees in people who tend to run late, he noted.",
      "\"Many chronically late individuals don't intend to be disrespectful. They're overwhelmed, anxious or trying to squeeze too much into too little time,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "These emotional patterns often show up in different ways. For some, anxiety can make it difficult to begin even simple tasks, pushing everything behind schedule before the day has even started, according to Alpert.",
      "For others, the struggle happens in the in-between moments. Shifting from one activity to another can feel surprisingly uncomfortable, so they linger longer than intended and lose time without noticing.",
      "Anxiety is a major factor behind why some people have trouble being on time, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Others may get caught up in the details, as perfectionism keeps them adjusting or \"fixing one more thing\" as the minutes slip away, Alpert said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Another major factor, the expert shared, is that many people simply misjudge how long tasks take. Their internal sense of time is often inaccurate, which leads them to assume they can fit far more into a day than is realistically possible.",
      "\u2018Time audit\u2019",
      "Alpert often recommends that his clients perform a simple \"time audit,\" where they track how long they think a routine task will take and then time it in real life. This can help them rebuild a more accurate internal clock, he said.",

      "Fat may be driven to the abdomen, chest, upper back (referred to as a \"buffalo hump\") or face, sometimes considered \"moon face,\" the doctor said.",

      "Friday's disclosure came as Democrats have claimed all year that Epstein's case has newfound salience because Trump, once among Epstein's many wealthy friends before Epstein was accused of trafficking underage girls, tried to suppress the files when he took office.

FBI Director Kash Patel, for instance, said in 2023 the government was hiding \"Epstein's list\" of \"pedophiles.\" But the DOJ leaders failed to deliver on those claims upon taking office.",

      "Minnesota is coming under heightened scrutiny as President Donald Trump has labeled Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" due to several key fraud schemes targeting the state's Medicaid program, and other federally funded programs that feed children. More than 80 people have faced charges in the state in connection with these schemes.",
      "Chris Edwards, the Kilts Family Chair in Fiscal Studies at the libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute, said that federal-state funding programs are ripe grounds for fraudulent activity.",
      "\"Federal aid-to-state programs are especially vulnerable to fraud and scams because the Feds mainly pay for them,\" Edwards said in a Tuesday email to Fox News Digital. \"The states administer and they care little about waste because the Feds are paying. The states would have more incentive to run efficient programs if they were funded by state taxes. The states must balance their budgets every year, so politicians must make tradeoffs and focus on efficiency.\"",
      "\"By contrast, the federal government runs massive deficits, so the politicians don't care much about waste,\" Edwards said. \"There's a double-problem with aid-to-state programs: the states don't care about waste because it's federal money, and the Feds don't care either because they run massive deficits.\"",

      "The Justice Department so far has charged less than a dozen people for allegedly defrauding the program that runs through Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid service, but more charges are expected.",
      "Additionally, the Trump administration and lawmakers have launched probes into Minnesota's \"Feeding Our Future\" $250 million fraud scheme that allegedly targeted a children's nutrition program the Department of Agriculture funded and that Minnesota oversaw during the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 77 people have been charged in that scheme, which took advantage of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to waive certain Federal Child Nutrition Program requirements.",
      "Some fraud cases in Minnesota have collapsed though, and Hennepin Country judge overturned a guilty verdict for Abdifatah Yusuf in a Medicaid fraud case in November. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced in August that Yusuf was found guilty of six counts of aiding and abetting theft by swindle, and claimed that Yusuf used his agency Promise Health Services, LLC to fraudulently obtain Medicaid funds for services that were not provided or were billed based on inaccurate documentation.",
      "Minnesota is dependent on the federal government for a significant portion of its funding. In 2023, federal funding toward Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid program totaled $11 billion \u2014 amounting to roughly 58% of all federal funding Minnesota receives, according to the House\u2019s Energy and Commerce Committee. Ultimately, the federal government covers approximately 51% of Minnesota's Medicaid costs.",
      "In every state, the federal government splits Medicaid costs using the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage formula, which is calculated by comparing the state's per capita income to U.S. per capita income. Percentages determining how much the federal government covers vary by state, with the federal government absorbing between 50% of Medicaid costs in states like California and Colorado, and up to nearly 77% in Mississippi, according to the Congressional Research Service.",

      "Minnesota\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital by deadline.",
      "Edwards said that it is easier than ever for criminal gangs to partake in these fraudulent schemes, due to the fact that benefits and subsidies are now paid automatically by federal computers, rather than through paper forms.",

Interviews with military experts show a contest defined not by tanks or troop movements, but by missile ranges, base access and whether U.S. forces can survive the opening salvos of a war that may begin long before any aircraft take off.",
      "\"The People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force \u2026 has built an increasing number of short-, medium-, and long-range missiles,\" Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Fox News Digital. \"They have the capability to shoot those across the first and increasingly the second island chains.\"",

      "U.S. missiles, from Tomahawks to SM-6s to future hypersonic weapons, are tied into a global surveillance network the People's Liberation Army cannot yet replicate. American targeting relies on satellites, undersea sensors, stealth drones and joint command tools matured over decades of combat experience.",
      "\"The Chinese have not fought a war since the 1970s,\" Jones said. \"We see lots of challenges with their ability to conduct joint operations across different services.\"",
      "The U.S., by contrast, has built multi-domain task forces in the Pacific to integrate cyber, space, electronic warfare and precision fires \u2014 a level of coordination analysts say China has yet to demonstrate.",

      "One of Washington\u2019s biggest advantages is its ability to conduct long-range strikes from beneath the ocean. U.S. submarines can fire cruise missiles from virtually anywhere in the Western Pacific, without relying on allied basing and without exposing launchers to Chinese fire \u2014 a degree of stealth China does not yet possess.",

      "Jones and Heginbotham both noted that the People's Liberation Army has far less experience coordinating forces across services and continues to grapple with doctrinal and organizational problems, including the dual commander\u2013political commissar structure inside its missile brigades.",
      "Alliances may be the most consequential difference. Japan, the Philippines, Australia and South Korea provide depth, intelligence sharing, logistics hubs and potential launch points for U.S. forces.",
      "China has no comparable network of partners, leaving it to operate from a much narrower geographic footprint. In a missile war, accuracy, integration and survivability often matter more than sheer volume \u2014 and in those areas the United States still holds meaningful advantages.",
      "At the heart of this competition is geography. Missiles matter less than the places they can be launched from, and China\u2019s ability to project power beyond its coastline remains sharply constrained.",
      "\"They\u2019ve got big power-projection problems right now,\" Jones said. \"They don\u2019t have a lot of basing as you get outside of the first island chain.\"",
      "The United States faces its own version of that challenge. Long-range Army and Marine Corps fires require host-nation permission, turning diplomacy into a form of firepower.",
      "\"It\u2019s absolutely central,\" Heginbotham said. \"You do need regional basing.\"",
      "Recent U.S. agreements with the Philippines, along with expanded cooperation with Japan and Australia, reflect a push to position American launchers close enough to matter without permanently stationing large ground forces there.",
      "A U.S.\u2013China land conflict would not involve armored columns maneuvering for territory. The decisive question is whether missile units on both sides can fire, relocate and fire again before being targeted.",
      "China has invested heavily in survivability, dispersing its brigades across underground bunkers, tunnels and hardened sites. Many can fire and relocate within minutes. Mobile launchers, decoys and deeply buried storage complexes make them difficult to neutralize.",

After two decades focused on counterterrorism, the Pentagon is now reinvesting in deception, mobility and hardened infrastructure \u2014 capabilities critical to surviving the opening stages of a missile war.",
      "Any U.S. intervention in a Taiwan conflict would also force Washington to confront a politically charged question: whether to strike missile bases on the Chinese mainland. Doing so risks escalation; avoiding it carries operational costs.",
      "\"Yes \u2026 you can defend Taiwan without striking bases inside China,\" Heginbotham said. \"But you are giving away a significant advantage.\"",
      "Holding back may help prevent the conflict from widening, but it also allows China to keep firing.",
      "\"It\u2019s a reality of conflict in the nuclear age that almost any conflict is gonna be limited in some ways,\" Heginbotham said. \"Then the question becomes where those boundaries are drawn, can you prevent it from spreading? What trade-offs you\u2019re willing to accept?\"",
      "A U.S.\u2013China clash on land would not be fought by massed armies. It would be a missile war shaped by geography, alliances and survivability \u2014 a contest where political access and command integration matter as much as raw firepower.",

      "For the United States, the challenge is clear: build enough long-range missiles, secure the basing needed to use them and keep launchers alive under fire. For China, the question is whether its vast missile arsenal and continental depth can offset weaknesses in coordination, command structure and real-world combat experience.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-fears-of-being-labeled-racist-helped-provide-cover-for-the-exploding-minnesota-fraud-scandal",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 06:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Minnesota fraud investigators faced racism accusations that effectively shielded billions in stolen funds from proper scrutiny in the massive Feeding Our Future scandal.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke to State Sen. Mark Koran, former prosecutor Joe Teirab, and columnist Dustin Grage about how claims of \u2018racism\u2019 shielded fraud within the Somali community in Minneapolis.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS, MN - In the aftermath of the massive Feeding Our Future scandal and broader allegations of systemic fraud in Minnesota\u2019s social programs, a troubling theme has emerged: accusations of racism repeatedly used to deflect scrutiny, intimidate investigators and stall accountability.",
      "Rumors and reports of fraud in Minneapolis, primarily within the city\u2019s exploding Somali community, have been circulating for at least a decade, but criticism of the fraud has been largely dismissed by elected Democrats as \"racist\" or being underpinned by animosity toward foreigners. News stories focused on Somali fraudsters in recent years were shot down as \"racist.\"",
      "\"The whole story kind of died under these accusations that people were being racist,\" Bill Glahn,\u00a0policy fellow with Center of the American Experiment, told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\"Oh, maybe somebody stole a little bit here, a little bit there, but there's nothing systemic going on.\"",
      "Former assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Teirab, who helped take on federal prosecutions in the Feeding Our Future case, described to Fox News Digital how individuals implicated in fraud leaned on racial accusations as a shield. According to Teirab, suspects explicitly invoked race during a secretly recorded meeting with Attorney General Keith Ellison, asserting that investigators were targeting them \"only because of race.\"",
      "OMAR ACCUSED BY GOP OPPONENT OF OPENING UP THE DOOR TO MASSIVE MINNEAPOLIS FRAUD: 'DEEP, DEEP TIES'",
      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images; Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images; Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Teirab called this tactic both deliberate and cynical. In one trial, a juror was even approached with a $120,000 cash bribe, allegedly accompanied by messaging intended to frame the investigation as racially motivated. The goal wasn\u2019t just to escape prosecution, it was to taint the system itself by threatening anyone pursuing the truth with the specter of racial bias.",
      "\"It provided cover,\" Teirab told Fox News Digital. \"Fraudsters knew the issue of race and racism was something they could use as a cudgel\u2026 It\u2019s disrespectful to use those terms when they\u2019re not appropriate, especially in a case where fraud clearly happened.\"",
      "Minnesota Republican State Sen. Mark Koran echoed Teirab\u2019s concerns, emphasizing that investigators followed the evidence, not demographics. Fraud prosecutions disproportionately affected one community simply because that\u2019s where significant fraud was uncovered, not because investigators targeted anyone based on race.",
      "\"The average Minnesotan, average legislator, doesn't care who's committing the fraud,\" Koran said. \"All right, the evidence will lead you either to or from the perpetrator. And so, if the evidence leads to the perpetrator, we need to prosecute all of them.\"",
      "Koran noted that public officials and agencies pursuing fraud were routinely branded racist for doing so. Some perpetrators were so \"emboldened,\" he said, that they sued the state to force the continuation of payments, even after red flags signaled massive irregularities.",
      "The scale, Koran argued, dwarfs what many Minnesotans understand. While federal authorities may ultimately prosecute around $2 billion in fraud, he suggested that the true annual losses across state programs could reach much higher when factoring in both blatant fraud and poor service delivery.",
      "Meanwhile, many families participated in related schemes by receiving kickbacks from fraudulent autism service providers, further complicating enforcement. Investigators simply lack the resources to chase every case, creating an environment where fraud becomes a low-risk, high-reward enterprise.",
      "MINNESOTA\u2019S FRAUD SCANDAL WAS \u2018SHOCKINGLY EASY\u2019 TO PULL OFF, IS LIKELY WORSE THAN REPORTED: EX PROSECUTOR",
      "Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, during a news conference. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File)",
      "\"For the average hardworking legal U.S. citizen doing everything right,\" Koran said, \"it\u2019s a disgusting disservice\u2026 knowing there\u2019s such blatant disregard for the value of that dollar.\"",
      "Koran suggested that the racism claims so emboldened supporters of the status quo that it contributed to Feeding Our Future suing the state of Minnesota, accusing state officials of racism for investigating the alleged fraud.",
      "Glahn told Fox News Digital that state agencies were \"cowering in fear\" over being called racist and local politicians were acutely aware that the \"racist label\" is a \"career kiss of death.\"",
      "A legislative auditor\u2019s report found Minnesota Department of Education officials felt they had to handle the nonprofit \"carefully\" because of these racism allegations and the risk of negative media coverage, and that this influenced which regulatory actions MDE did or did not take, CBS News reported.",
      "Political commentator and Townhall columnist Dustin Grage highlighted another factor enabling the fraud: media hesitation. Conservative reporters, he said, described to him hitting internal roadblocks when pitching stories about the Feeding Our Future scandal because editors feared being accused of racism.",
      "\"In newsrooms, they\u2019re told, \u2018We can\u2019t run that because we\u2019re going to be accused of being racist,\u2019\" Grage explained. That fear, combined with political pressure, allowed the scandal to grow largely unchecked until federal indictments forced it into the spotlight.",

      "Grage pointed to an early pivotal moment: Minnesota\u2019s Department of Education detected signs of fraud and briefly halted payments. Immediately, Minneapolis political figures Omar Fateh and Jamal Osman pushed back, claiming the stop was racially motivated. They even took the state to court, though their case was eventually thrown out.",
      "Yet the damage was done. Payments resumed, and crucially, Gov. Tim Walz declined to use his subpoena power to obtain Feeding Our Future's bank records, despite having the authority to do so. That inaction, Grage noted, further delayed the exposure of the fraud.",

      "The sun shines on the Minnesota state Capitol. (Steve Karnowski/Associated Press)",
      "Glahn told Fox News Digital that in addition to fear of the \"racist\" label, politicians in Minnesota understand that it is difficult to win elections without the support of the Somali community.",
      "\"The Somali community is very concentrated in Minnesota and very concentrated in Ilhan Omar's congressional district, and a few other pockets where the Somali vote swings elections, and at the state level, they're big enough that we've had some super close elections at the state level, and the Somali vote is very monolithic, votes Democrat,\" Glahn explained. \"They provided the difference in statewide elections, and then in local elections, where it's all Democrats, they're providing the difference in the primary. So if you're running in a primary against other Democrats, if you don't have the Somali vote on your side, you're not making it to the general election.\"",
      "The result of the fear to fully investigate the fraud was predictable: fraudsters exploited that hesitation, taxpayers lost billions and the vulnerable communities the programs were meant to serve suffered most.",
      "As the state continues to grapple with accountability and reform, one lesson stands out starkly. According to those who spoke to Fox News Digital, combating fraud requires courage, not only to follow the evidence wherever it leads, but to withstand the inevitable attempts to distort legitimate scrutiny into something it is not.",

      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",

      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking.

      "News of more than 120,000 Korean home cameras being hacked recently can shake your confidence in connected devices. Stories like that make you picture cybercriminals breaking into homes with high-tech gadgets and spying on families through smart cams. That reaction is natural. But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",

      "SMART HOME DEVICE MAKER EXPOSES 2.7 BILLION RECORDS IN HUGE DATA BREACH",
      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",
      "ADT HACKED: IS YOUR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM REALLY SECURE?",
      "Who actually tries to hack smart homes",
      "When hacking happens, it usually involves someone with some level of access already. In many cases, no technical hack occurs at all.",
      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",
      "Steps to stay safe in your smart home",
      "Strong habits and a few simple tools can block the most common threats that target connected homes.",
      "Choose long, complex passwords for your Wi-Fi router and smart home apps. A password manager makes this simple. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",

      "Removing your personal details from data broker sites helps prevent criminals from using leaked or scraped information to access your accounts or identify your home.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Pick smart home products from companies that explain how they protect your data and use modern encryption to lock down your footage and account details. Look for brands that publish clear security policies, offer regular updates and show how they keep your information private.",
      "Pick security cameras that let you save video directly to an SD card or a home hub, rather than uploading it to the cloud. This keeps your recordings under your control (and helps protect them if a company server is breached). Many cameras from trusted lines support local storage, so you do not have to rely on a company server.",
      "Install firmware updates quickly. Enable automatic updates when possible. Replace older gadgets that no longer receive patches.",
      "Your router is the front door to your smart home, so lock it down with a few simple tweaks. Use WPA3 encryption if your router supports it, rename the default network, and install firmware updates to patch security holes. For a full step-by-step guide on tightening your home network, check out our instructions in \"How to set up a home network like a pro.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smart homes feel intimidating when scary headlines surface. But when you look at real-world data, you see far fewer risks than the stories suggest. Most attacks rely on weak passwords, poor router settings or old devices. With the right habits, your smart home can stay both convenient and secure.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "MIT\u2019s light-based scanner reads blood sugar through the skin without a single prick. (iStock)",
      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A handheld or watch-sized glucose scanner would mark a major shift in diabetes care. MIT's work brings that future closer with a design that reads your chemistry through light. The next few clinical trials will show how well it performs in real conditions.",

      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information.

      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

      "This dome creates a full food ecosystem by recycling water and nutrients in a closed loop. (VikingDome)",
      "Inside the Source of Life dome",
      "The 21-foot structure sits on a base with four water zones that support marine fish, brackish species and freshwater species. Their waste creates the nutrients that feed the plant layers above. Microbes convert ammonia into nitrates that plants love.",
      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest. The layout functions like an ecological slice from ocean to land instead of floors.",

      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",
      "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology designed the system to copy nature. It follows the same recycling found in healthy wetlands. By letting biology do the work, the system reduces strain on land and water.",
      "The system shows how cities may produce fresh food on rooftops and small urban spaces. (VikingDome)",

    "summary": "ChatGPT data breach exposes personal info of users through partner Mixpanel. OpenAI confirms names, emails compromised in security incident.",
    "story": [
      "'Outnumbered' panelists react to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's admission that he 'cannot imagine' raising his newborn son without help from ChatGPT.",
      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",
      "Attackers can use leaked metadata to craft convincing phishing emails that look legitimate. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "Right now, Call Reason only supports the urgent label. Google has hinted that more options could come later, like short custom messages or emoji-style indicators. That could add even more clarity when your call is tied to a specific topic.",

      "A breakthrough that turns one donor cornea into hundreds",
      "The cornea came from a healthy deceased donor and was then multiplied in the lab. Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.",
      "Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.",
      "HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT",
      "Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.",
      "The surgery used a fully 3D printed corneal implant grown from cultured human cells and restored sight to a legally blind patient. (Rambam Eye Institute)",
      "The surgery that proved it works",
      "Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.",
      "He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"",
      "The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.",
      "How the science fits into a bigger future",
      "The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.",

      "Professor Michael Mimouni led the surgical team at Rambam Eye Institute's Cornea Unit. (Rambam Eye Institute)",

      "If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.",
      "This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use. Even so, the progress feels fast when the result is restored sight.",

      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",

      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts. Also, install strong antivirus software to detect malicious links, fake sites or malware that tries to capture your keystrokes.",

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",

      "Understanding common phone settings helps users stay safer, avoid scams and cut down on battery drain. (Photo by Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "1) Background permissions",
      "This refers to what an app is allowed to do when you're not actively using it. Some apps continue running behind the scenes, checking your location, refreshing content or connecting to the internet, even after you've closed them.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0If an app has background permission, it may: Use more battery, use more data, track your location or run when you're not using it.",
      "Examples:",
      "A weather app checking your location every hourA fitness app reading your steps even when closedA shopping app accessing data when it shouldn't",
      "A weather app checking your location every hour",
      "A fitness app reading your steps even when closed",
      "A shopping app accessing data when it shouldn't",
      "Where to check this on your phone:",
      "On iPhone:",
      "Go to\u00a0SettingsTap\u00a0Privacy & SecurityChoose\u00a0Location Services, Microphone or CameraReview which apps have access and set them to\u00a0While Using the App instead of\u00a0Always, or toggle permissions\u00a0off entirely if the app doesn't need that access in the background.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings",
      "Tap\u00a0Privacy & Security",
      "Choose\u00a0Location Services, Microphone or Camera",
      "Review which apps have access and set them to\u00a0While Using the App instead of\u00a0Always, or toggle permissions\u00a0off entirely if the app doesn't need that access in the background.",
      "On Android:",
      "Settings may vary depending on your Android phone\u2019s manufacturer",
      "Open\u00a0SettingsTap\u00a0Security and PrivacyClick\u00a0More privacy settings\u00a0Tap\u00a0Permission ManagerSelect a category like\u00a0Location or Camera",

      "Click\u00a0More privacy settings",
      "Tap\u00a0Permission Manager",
      "Select a category like\u00a0Location or Camera",
      "Adjust each app's level of access to\u00a0Allow only while using the app,\u00a0Ask every time or\u00a0Deny, depending on what it actually needs to function.",
      "2) Auto-join networks",
      "Your phone remembers Wi-Fi networks you've connected to before, like stores, gyms, hotels, airports or even an old home router and reconnects automatically whenever it detects them again. The problem is that scammers can create look-alike networks with the same name, tricking your phone into joining without you noticing.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control. Your phone could quietly connect to networks you no longer trust or to fake hotspots designed to steal logins, read unencrypted traffic or inject malicious content. Turning off auto-join for places you don't use often keeps you safer from these silent, high-risk connections.",
      "Examples:",
      "Your phone reconnects to the \"Airport Wi-Fi\" months laterYou join a caf\u00e9 network once, and your phone keeps connecting every time you pass byA fake \"Starbucks Wi-Fi\" network that tricks devices that auto-join",

      "Background permissions let apps run quietly behind the scenes and may use data or track location if not adjusted. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",
      "Examples:",
      "Bank fraud alertsWeather warningsSale notifications from a shopping appGames trying to get you to come back",
      "Bank fraud alerts",
      "Weather warnings",
      "Sale notifications from a shopping app",

      "Tap\u00a0Notifications",
      "Tap\u00a0App Notifications",
      "Turn off alerts for apps you no longer want to hear from",
      "4) Security updates",
      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",
      "Examples:Patches that fix a flaw in your browserUpdates that stop malware from workingProtection against new phishing techniques",
      "On iPhone",
      "Go to\u00a0SettingsTap\u00a0GeneralTap Software UpdateInstall any\u00a0available updates, including\u00a0Security Responses & System Files if they appear",

      "Check for\u00a0new patches",
      "Click\u00a0Install now or\u00a0Schedule install",
      "5) App Refresh (also known as Background App Refresh)",
      "This is when apps update their content even when you're not using them, refreshing news, updating emails, pulling in notifications or syncing data. It keeps apps \"fresh,\" but also drains more battery and uses more mobile data.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0 Background App Refresh can quietly drain your battery, use mobile data and let apps run more often than they need to. Limiting it gives you more control over what apps do behind the scenes and reduces unnecessary tracking, resource use and surprise data charges.",
      "Examples:",
      "A news app updating headlines every few minutesEmail syncing continuouslyA social media app is loading new posts in the background",
      "A news app updating headlines every few minutes",
      "Email syncing continuously",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tech terms don't have to feel like a foreign language. Background permissions help you keep apps from accessing too much information. Auto-join networks show how your phone reconnects to Wi-Fi without asking. Push notifications explain why your phone keeps buzzing. Security updates keep your device protected from new threats. And App Refresh reveals why your battery might drain faster than you expect. Understanding these basics makes your phone safer, faster and easier to use.",

      "According to a senior Israeli intelligence official who spoke on background with Fox News Digital, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service provided Australian authorities with concrete warnings about what the official described as Iranian-directed terror activity operating inside Australia. The warning, the official said, was not about the Bondi Beach attack specifically, but about broader efforts to build terror networks with the intent of harming Jewish targets.",

Australian officials said the investigation into the attack remains ongoing and have not attributed it to a foreign state. An intelligence source said we will know in the next few days if there has been such guidance.",
      "The Israeli intelligence assessments align with warnings from a senior foreign diplomatic source, who described the current threat environment as being driven by a global contagion effect, in which extremist networks worldwide amplify and celebrate attacks, encouraging others to replicate them.",

      "Rob Reiner, who was born into Hollywood comedic royalty and forged his own path directing films that marked America's mood through humor, satire and nostalgia, died Sunday.",
      "He was 78.",
      "Reiner, who was active for more than four decades, is best known for a string of films from the 1980s into the 1990s now considered modern classics: \"Stand by Me,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" \"Misery\" and \"A Few Good Men,\" among others.",
      "The filmmaker was found dead alongside wife, Michele Singer Reiner, 68, at their home in Los Angeles, according to a source close to the Reiner family.",
      "Rob Reiner's father was actor and comedian Carl Reiner, creator of one of the postwar era's most successful television series, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\"",
      "As a young adult growing up in Los Angeles, Rob Reiner attended Beverly Hills High School and completed studies at nearby UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television.",
      "He was launched into the homes of America in 1971 with the comedic TV drama \"All in the Family,\" on which he played the son-in-law of its patriarch, Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor), and his foil.",
      "The two sparred, with Reiner's \"Meathead\" challenging his elder's conservative views of women, people of color and LGBTQ communities. The clashes drew bursts of laughter and, sometimes, gasps, from the show's studio audience and from home viewers. They reflected the nation's changing outlook in the decade as baby boomers began to dominate music, film and sometimes politics. Reiner won an Emmy in 1974 for his portrayal.",
      "Reiner has said that in real life O'Connor helped him transition to directing after the show ended in 1979, and by the mid-1980s \"Meathead\" had grown up to become a marquee director.",
      "The film that got him off the starting line was the satire \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a look at an aging British hard rock band that has no self-awareness, an allegory for his generation, in ways.",
      "Reiner plays a documentarian, and the film rolls out with wholly deadpan humor with the help of Reiner collaborators Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. One of the film's most legendary bits happens when Guest's character explains he has had an amplifier's maximum volume changed from 10 to 11, insisting it's louder because of the graphic transformation.",
      "The 1984 release was hailed by critics and became enough of a cult classic that Reiner returned to the band this year with September's release of \"This is Spinal Tap II.\"",
      "He established Castle Rock Entertainment as an independent production house in 1987 and churned out box office hits.",
      "By the 1990s, Reiner had become a director of history, finding sentimental feelings in titles such as \"Stand By Me,\" \"The American President\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" the latter a documentary about the work of the comedic actor.",
      "He remained active in Hollywood through the latter half of 2025, doing interviews and promotion for \"This is Spinal Tap II.\"",
      "Reiner had been a mainstay of fundraising support for the Democratic Party and its top candidates for office, including when President Joe Biden was hoping for a second term.",
      "In October, Reiner criticized President Donald Trump's administration, describing the political climate as \u201cbeyond McCarthy era-esque.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: We have a year before this country becomes a full-on autocracy and democracy completely leaves us,\" he said in an interview on MSNBC (which has since been rebranded as MS NOW).",
      "\u201cI believe the way to stop it is to educate people who may not understand what democracy is. They may not know what the impact of losing it is,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to explain it, us storytellers have to explain to them what they\u2019re going to wind up with if an autocrat has his way.\"",
      "In 2008, he co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought for same-sex-marriage rights in California. He also launched a ballot initiative in California 27 years ago that established a tobacco tax to fund an education and development program, First 5, for the state's youngest children.",
      "\u201cAn acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, [Rob] always used his gifts in service of others,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement, adding that \u201che and Michele fought for early childhood development and marriage equality, working to overturn Proposition 8. They were true champions for LGBTQ+ rights.\u201d",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom also issued expressed his condolences to the Reiner family, highlighting Reiner's political advocacy.",
      "\"Rob was a passionate advocate for children and for civil rights \u2014 from taking on Big Tobacco to fighting for marriage equality to serving as a powerful voice in early education,\" Newsom said in a statement.",

      "\u201cThis statement is wrong,\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who sits in one of the most competitive congressional districts in the country, wrote on X. \u201cRegardless of one\u2019s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It\u2019s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.\u201dRepublicans who criticize Trump have long risked alienating MAGA voters, whose support will be critical to vulnerable incumbents in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Lawler\u2019s decision to push back on the president may suggest that he believes he is on safe ground \u2014 even with hard-core Trump voters \u2014 in expressing a contrary view on Reiner.",

      "\u201cRegardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,\u201d Massie wrote. \u201cI guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they\u2019re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\u201d",

He was also a prominent figure who voiced his view, in the wake of conservative Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination in September, that violence is not an answer to political disagreement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what your political beliefs are: That\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Reiner told interviewer Piers Morgan, expressing his \u201cabsolute horror\u201d at Kirk\u2019s shooting. Andrew Kolvet, the spokesman for Kirk\u2019s group, Turning Point USA, posted the Morgan-Reiner interview on Sunday night, before Trump\u2019s social media post.

      "Trump\u2019s take stood in stark contrast to the reactions of many MAGA figures, including those who were vocal following Kirk\u2019s death. Some at the time  accused the political left of insensitivity because certain progressives pointed to Kirk\u2019s beliefs to explain anger toward him. On Sunday night and early Monday morning, they largely expressed sympathy for Reiner.",

He said many hateful things like he was a symbol of hate, he called him mentally ill, and suggested he should be arrested for treason, a crime punishable by death. I don\u2019t blame the president for having the reaction that he had.\u201d",
      "Jack Posobiec, a conservative commentator who is close to the Trump administration, framed Trump\u2019s post as an admonition rather than a celebration of Reiner\u2019s killing. \u201cWhere is the celebration in Trump\u2019s post?

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is considering a rule change that would cut back on how often dietary supplement warnings must appear on packaging, a move experts say could make them easier to miss.",
      "Unlike prescription drugs, the FDA doesn\u2019t review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they hit the market.",
      "A 1994 federal law requires supplement companies to include a disclaimer when they make health claims like \u201csupports immune health\u201d or \u201cpromotes heart health\u201d or better memory. According to the law, next to promises about benefits, the packaging must display in boldface type: \u201cThis statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\u201d",
      "In a letter to supplement makers dated Thursday, Kyle Diamantas, the head of the FDA\u2019s food division, said the possible proposal would still require companies to include the disclaimer on their products at least once, but it would no longer require it to be repeated every time a health claim appears.",
      "Diamantas said that the agency has rarely enforced the existing rule and that the change would cut down on label clutter and costs.",
      "He didn\u2019t say when the rule change could take effect, but said the FDA wouldn\u2019t enforce the existing requirement while it reviews the policy.",
      "\u201cIf FDA does not identify significant concerns as we continue our review of the available data and information regarding this request, we are likely to propose a rule to amend this requirement,\u201d Diamantas wrote in the letter.",
      "More than three-quarters of Americans take at least one supplement, botanical, mineral or vitamin, according to the FDA. As many as 100,000 supplement products are sold in stores or online in the U.S.",
      "Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA\u2019s move could be the first step toward making already weak supplement warnings even weaker.",
      "\u201cThen you start saying things like, \u2018We only need it on the actual bottle,\u2019\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThen you say, \u2018It only needs to be on the back.\u2019 Then you let the print get smaller.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said the change wouldn\u2019t make it harder for consumers to notice the warning, adding that \u201ca growing number of Americans are paying closer to attention to product labels.\u201d",
      "Dietary supplements are popular among figures tied to the Make America Healthy Again movement. Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was criticized during his confirmation hearing in March for previously promoting supplements he described as a \u201cmagic weight loss cure\u201d or a \u201cmiracle in a bottle.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has stated he takes a wide range of supplements himself, said the Trump administration would move to free Americans from what he called the FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of vitamins and dietary supplements.",
      "Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner, said he wasn\u2019t sure what it meant for consumers but a rule change means supplement makers wouldn\u2019t have to make the disclaimers as prominent, possibly making them easier to miss.",
      "Cohen countered that because dietary supplements aren\u2019t reviewed before they\u2019re sold, the products can contain different amounts of ingredients than what\u2019s listed on the label \u2014 or ingredients not listed at all.",
      "A 2023 paper by Cohen published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that nearly 9 out of 10 melatonin gummy brands were inaccurately labeled.",
      "\u201cThis further undermines the ability of consumers to understand the true health effects,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Steve Mister, the president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the supplement industry, said in a statement the group \u201cwelcomed\u201d the FDA\u2019s clarification on warning labels.",
      "The group previously told the FDA that a single disclaimer on a supplement\u2019s label \u2014 linked to health claims with an asterisk or similar symbol \u2014 is enough to inform people and meet the federal law\u2019s intent."

      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",

      "But the \u201cEras Tour\u201d \u2014 and all the preparation required for it \u2014 massively predates their relationship. (In fact, Kelce attending the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in July 2023 led to them meeting in the first place, after a missed friendship bracelet connection.)",
      "Before she started dating Kelce, Swift, who was born in Pennsylvania, had previously alluded to her love of the Philly team. In her 2020 song \u201cGold Rush,\u201d she briefly sings about her \u201cEagles T-shirt hanging from the door.\u201d Then, amid speculation that the lyric could refer to the team or the \u201cHotel California\u201d band, Swift said onstage in Philadelphia in May 2023, \u201cGuys, like, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m from Philly. Of course it\u2019s the team.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Swift is seen wearing an Eagles sweatshirt in multiple clips from that rehearsal.",
      "As she arrived at the rehearsal space, she already had tears in her eyes. While shaking the hand of one of her fellow performers, she said, \u201cI\u2019m weirdly emotional right now. It\u2019s so nice to meet you, I\u2019m Taylor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the boss come into rehearsal crying with tears of happiness and passion about their job,\u201d dancer Whyley Yoshimura said about the moment.",
      "The \u201cEras Tour\u201d went on to kick off just weeks after her then-beloved Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. That matchup made headlines for being the first Super Bowl to see two brothers \u2014 you guessed it, Travis and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 face off on opposing teams.",
      "Unfortunately for Philly fans, by the 2025 Super Bowl, when the Eagles got their revenge and defeated the Chiefs 40-22, Swift had already switched allegiances, proudly supporting Travis Kelce.",
      "Regarding football, she has since said, \u201cThe whole season I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce\u2019s brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center, has yet to comment on the sweatshirt\u2019s appearance."

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers from \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d",
      "Benoit Blanc has stumbled into a contemptuous congregation hiding a murderous secret in his latest whodunnit, \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d",
      "Set in a small upstate New York town, the third installment in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise from director and writer Rian Johnson tackles religion, false prophets and, of course, a complicated murder.",
      "The film \u2014 now streaming on Netflix \u2014 is mostly told through the perspective of a young priest named Jud, played by Josh O\u2019Connor, who is sent to help run a modest parish led by Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, portrayed by Josh Brolin. After meeting Wicks and developing a strained dynamic with him, he also meets the monsignor\u2019s loyal congregation: Wicks\u2019 right-hand woman Martha (Glenn Close), doctor Nat (Jeremy Renner), lawyer Vera (Kerry Washington) struggling author Lee (Andrew Scott), chronically ill concert cellist Simone (Cailee Spaeny), failed politician Cy (Daryl McCormack) and groundskeeper Samson (Thomas Haden Church).",
      "During one service, the monsignor delivers a disparaging and chaotic homily, his speciality, before stepping into a compact side room to collect himself while Jud briefly takes over. Seconds later, Jud and the churchgoers hear a loud thud before finding Wicks lying on the ground, dead. Baffled by how the murderer pulled off their plan, local police chief Geraldine (Mila Kunis) enlists the help of renowned detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, to unravel the case.",
      "Compared to the previous films, \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d has a darker tone and more violence. Johnson tells TODAY.com that he wanted to \u201cground\u201d the third movie and its themes in a subject that was \u201cvery personal for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI grew up very Christian. I\u2019m not a believer anymore, but it\u2019s something I have a lot of complicated feelings about,\u201d he shares.  \u201cSo the challenge of seeing if we can make a big, entertaining, fun whodunnit and at the same time, in a complicated and generous way \u2014 not just a finger wagging way \u2014 look at those issues of faith and Christianity in America right now.\u201d",
      "He adds, \u201cThat seemed like a worthy challenge.\u201d",
      "A big reason he was able to pull it off: Craig\u2019s portrayal of Blanc. Johnson says that the actor\u2019s performance, while hilarious and captivating, is rooted in basic human decency and empathy. He also notes that in each of his \u201cKnives Out\u201d movies he has paired Blanc with a good-hearted protagonist who anchors the film. For \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d the relationship between Blanc, a nonbeliever, and O\u2019Connor\u2019s Jud, a devoted priest, is at the center of the movie.",
      "Johnson reveals that Jud was the most difficult character to pin down when he worked on the script because of his arc.",
      "\u201cI hope the movie lands in an emotionally satisfying place for the audience\u2026that was definitely the biggest challenge. But I feel really, really proud of the result,\u201d he says.",
      "Each film in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise is named after a song. Johnson teases that \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d the title of a 1997 U2 song from the band\u2019s album \u201cPop\u201d that is always playing in his head, fit perfectly for the flick\u2019s unexpected twist.",
      "\u201cFor reasons that\u2019ll become more clear once you see the movie, it makes a lot of sense for this film,\u201d he shares.",
      "Read on to find out how Blanc pieces together the clues to solve \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d and how the film\u2019s clever title comes to fruition.",
      "How Does \u2018Wake Up Dead Man\u2019 End?",
      "\u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d includes the most on-screen deaths in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise, as Wicks isn\u2019t the only character who is brutally murdered. During a stormy night, the Wicks family tomb, where the monsignor was buried, miraculously opens from the inside and a man resembling Wicks emerges. (Hence the movie\u2019s title.) The revived man then follows a hooded figure into the woods. Jud, watching from afar, goes after the two of them. He is knocked unconscious and awakens to find Samson impaled with a garden hook. Meanwhile, another hooded figure is seen meeting with Nat at his home in the middle of the night.",
      "Blanc discovers a disheveled Jud, who believes he is responsible for Samson\u2019s murder and needs to confess. But before Jud can turn himself in to Geraldine, he and Blanc travel to Nat\u2019s home. There, they find the doctor\u2019s body disintegrated in a tub filled with toxic chemicals, leaving only his bones.",
      "Overcome by guilt, Jud goes to speak to Geraldine. As he tries to confess, Blanc interrupts him and reveals to Jud, Geraldine and the rest of the monsignor\u2019s followers that he knows who the killer is.",
      "The detective explains in his delightful Southern accent that the monsignor collapsed after drinking a poisoned flask following his homily. He says that when the rest of the congregation joined Jud to investigate the body, the killer\u2019s accomplice, Nat, secretly stabbed Wicks, who was already dead.",
      "While relaying the evidence, Blanc abruptly pauses and says he cannot continue. He\u2019d prefer the culprit admit their sins. After most of the congregation leaves the church, Martha remains and confirms she is the killer. She recalls that when she was a little girl, Wicks\u2019 father, Prentice, swallowed his family\u2019s inheritance \u2014 a rare jewel \u2014 prior to his death to prevent his children and the church from becoming corrupted by greed. She was the only one who knew the truth about the location of the jewel and chose to keep it to herself for decades.",
      "But when Jud arrived at the parish, she decided to share her secret with the monsignor during confession. She instantly realized she had made a mistake and plotted to kill Wicks so he couldn\u2019t get the jewel. She teamed up with Nat, since he had access to drugs they could use to spike Wicks\u2019 flask. Their convoluted plan also contained another crucial step: they removed Wicks\u2019 body from his coffin and instead Samson, Martha\u2019s husband, would take his place. The switch allowed the groundskeeper to remove the jewel from Prentice\u2019s corpse and lie in the casket until he received a signal. Then, he would perform the \u201cmiracle\u201d of exiting the Wicks tomb, bringing more parishioners and prestige to the church.",
      "However, the plan went awry when Samson met with Nat in the woods after leaving the tomb. Nat stabbed Samson with the garden tool and stole the jewel. Martha discovered Nat\u2019s betrayal, went to his home, inconspicuously snatched the jewel and pushed the doctor into the toxic tub, killing him.",
      "After revealing how she pulled off her crimes, Martha dies in Jud and Blanc\u2019s arms, as she willingly ingested the same poison Wicks drank.",
      "While chatting to TODAY.com about the killer\u2019s reveal, Kerry Washington, whose character is one of the few that has a happy ending, says she didn\u2019t see it coming when she first read the script.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way when I got to the end that I would have been able to guess it,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried while I was reading it, and I just never would have.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Emma Wood knew her Spotify Wrapped, an annual tradition that synthesizes users\u2019 listening habits, would be full of Taylor Swift.",
      "What the 13-year-old didn\u2019t expect, however, was being crowned the platform\u2019s top listener of the artist \u2014 quite a feat, considering Swift has over 100 million listeners on Spotify and was the second most-streamed artist of 2025, behind only Bad Bunny.",
      "She learned of her No. 1 status through Spotify Wrapped's new Fan Leaderboard feature.",
      "\u201cThink you\u2019re one of your top artist\u2019s biggest fans? This year, you might see where you rank among their listeners worldwide, based on your total minutes listened,\u201d an announcement on Spotify\u2019s website reads.",
      "According to screenshots and screen recordings of Wood\u2019s Spotify Wrapped, she is Swift\u2019s No. 1 listener. Spotify declined to comment for this story.",
      "Wood personally amassed a total of 449,000 minutes listened to Swift, which Spotify equated to 312 days. Most of her minutes are from enjoying her favorite song, \u201cThe Albatross,\u201d from Swift\u2019s 2024 album \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she streamed 83,601 times in 2024. (Her TikTok username, @thealbatrosswife, points to the obsession).",
      "Wood says she was shocked when she saw the numbers.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think that it was going to be that high,\u201d Wood tells TODAY.com. \u201cI thought it was going to be, like, maybe 12,000 or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018Is my Spotify glitching?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "On Dec. 4, Wood shared her Spotify listening feat on TikTok. The video, with over 10 million views, showed screenshotted proof of Wood\u2019s top listener title as she reacted in shock, writing on the video: \u201cBefore you ask YES I have a therapist.\u201d",
      "Wood\u2019s video amassed reactions \u2014 and skepticism. Wood followed up with another video of her scrolling through her Spotify Wrapped results on her mom\u2019s phone, to prove her case.",
      "Before you ask: Yes, Wood does listen to Swift while she sleeps, which helped rack up her dayslong minutes-listened number.",
      "Wood says she listens to music when she falls asleep because she \u201ccan\u2019t sleep otherwise.\u201d It\u2019s a habit that dates back to a sweet childhood memory.",
      "\u201cWhen I was little, and I couldn\u2019t fall asleep, my dad would just play a song from his band, and I would be asleep,\u201d she says.",
      "Instead of hearing her dad play a song, now she falls asleep to Swift.",
      "Wood says she never gets sick of \u201cThe Albatross\u201d \u2014 even on the 83,601st listen. \u201cThe Albatross\u201d plays on the legend of the albatross, a seabird said to bring bad luck to sailors and is now associated with burdens. Swift likens the albatross to a person, or more specifically \u201ca woman, here to destroy you.\u201d",
      "For her, this 2024 song is a background song she can play while relaxing or scrolling online, and it\u2019s also a song she can tune her full attention to when she wants to belt the lyrics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another song that I could actually like listen to that makes me feel that way,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really is kind of just like a comfort song.\u201d",
      "Wood explains how music, particularly Swift\u2019s, plays a large role in her mental health. Last year, Wood says she \u201cwas not doing the best mentally,\u201d and while feeling down, she remembers turning on this song for the first time.",
      "\u201cSo just having a song that I really just look back and I\u2019m like, \u2018This song has been with me through some of the hardest times and some of the easiest times of my life,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Wood\u2019s mother, Monica, attested to how much Swift has truly impacted her daughter.",
      "\u201cI saw a complete turnaround in Emma. She went from depressed to extremely happy,\u201d Monica told TODAY.com. \u201cI never realized how much Taylor Swift meant to Emma until this happened,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cI never knew how much Taylor was helping her through music. Taylor\u2019s music is Emma\u2019s therapy,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so crazy to think like there was once an 11-year-old girl who was scared to even go to school, like literally just waiting for the \u2018Tortured Poets Department\u2019 to come out and now there\u2019s a 13-year-old girl who can\u2019t go a day without listening to it,\u201d Wood says.",
      "Through all the viral videos and the continuous streaming, Wood says she has so much to tell Swift if given the chance.",
      "\u201cI would just say thank you so much for being the person that you are and being my comfort artist in so many different ways,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know I exist, but thank you for understanding me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would love to meet her one day, I really would,\u201d Wood adds."

      "\u201cF1 The Movie,\u201d directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, tells the story of a Formula 1 driver named Sonny Hayes (Pitt) who was a star in the \u201890s with a promising career until he had a life-threatening accident on the track. Thirty years later, Ruben Cervantes, a friend and owner of a down-and-out Formula 1 team (Bardem), gets Sonny to return to racing, where he teams up with hotshot rookie Joshua (Idris).",

      "He also shared that the movie was shot at nine of the 22 different tracks around the world as the plot includes the last nine races of the season.",

      "Getting Machado out of Venezuela required disguising her appearance. Stern did not say exactly what they did to get her out and wouldn\u2019t comment on a Wall Street Journal account that she, at some point, donned a wig.",
      "\u201cHer face was a problem because she is the most famous person in Venezuela outside of Maduro,\u201d he said, noting that there are billboards with Machado\u2019s image everywhere in Venezuela.",

      "Stern said he met Machado for the first time on Tuesday evening. He would not say exactly when or where he rendezvoused with Machado, but it involved her taking a small skiff from a fishing village and transferring her at sea to the somewhat bigger fishing boat that he was on.",
      "\u201cI was on the second leg of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cI got very close to Venezuela.\u201d",

      "\u201cI first met her at sea,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe used a fishing boat to get her to her flight.\u201d",
      "Stern said the flight took off from Cura\u00e7ao, which is about 40 miles north of Venezuela and is a self-governing island that is part of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI would say we transited through Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d Stern said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Cura\u00e7ao. She never cleared immigration in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201d",
      "Stern said this was the most challenging mission he and his group have undertaken. As for Machado, Stern said he\u2019s a big fan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine.\u201d"

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

      "Can children and teenagers be forced off social media en masse? Australia is about to find out.",
      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always referred to this as the first domino, which is why they pushed back,\u201d Julie Inman Grant, who regulates online safety as Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, said at an event in Sydney last week.",
      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m trying to chat to someone, they might say, \u2018Just a minute,\u2019 and they\u2019re doing something on social media,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Canberra.",
      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",
      "If young people are blocked from social media, \u201cwe just don\u2019t learn the life skills and we don\u2019t learn the experience of going through and knowing what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said.",
      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

      "A Sydney resident who disarmed a gunman during the deadly attack at Australia\u2019s famous Bondi Beach on Sunday is in hospital after undergoing surgery for bullet wounds, his family said.",
      "Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner, was praised for his bravery after video circulated showing him tackling one of the shooters to the ground. President Donald Trump called him \u201cvery, very brave,\u201d while New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described Ahmed as a \u201creal-life hero\u201d who saved many lives.",
      "Authorities have declared the shooting a terrorist act, saying it was intended to target Jewish people. Police said a 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son carried out the attack during a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach, killing at least 15 people in Australia's deadliest mass shooting in nearly three decades.",
      "Video verified by NBC News appears to show multiple shooters and the moment that a man holding a gun is disarmed by Ahmed.",
      "In the footage, Ahmed crouches behind a parked car before rushing one of the alleged shooters from behind. After a brief struggle, he wrestles the weapon away. The shooter then backs away before Ahmed places the weapon beside a palm tree.",
      "The video appears to show a shoot-out continuing moments later,  as a second gunman standing on a bridge fires repeatedly toward people attempting to intervene.",
      "Ahmed was taken to Sydney's St George's Hospital with bullet wounds, where he was pictured chatting with Minns from his hospital bed, his arm wrapped in a cast.",
      "\"His incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,\" Minns posted on X. \"It was an honor to spend time with him just now and to pass on the thanks of people across NSW.\"",
      "Minns added: \"There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for Ahmed\u2019s selfless courage.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told National Broadcaster ABC that the country had witnessed \"the worst of humanity\" during the attack, \"but we also saw an example of the best of humanity in Ahmed al Ahmed,\" who he praised for saving lives."

    "summary": "Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong activist and media mogul who was a major figure in 2019 pro-democracy protests, was convicted Monday in a landmark national security trial.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong activist and media mogul who was a major figure in 2019 pro-democracy protests, was convicted on all charges Monday in a landmark national security trial that has drawn international scrutiny and become a symbol of Beijing\u2019s crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory.",
      "Lai, one of the most prominent critics of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, was arrested in 2020 shortly after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in response to the anti-government protests, which roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019 and sometimes turned violent.",
      "He was found guilty of two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials under legislation from Hong Kong\u2019s time as a British colony.",
      "Lai, who turned 78 last week and faces life in prison, will be sentenced later and is allowed to appeal. On Monday, he appeared thin but in good spirits as he entered the courtroom wearing glasses, a pale green sweater and a gray jacket, smiling and waving to his family.",
      "Western governments and rights groups have criticized the 156-day trial, which began in December 2023, as politically motivated. Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai, a British citizen, to be released, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to \u201cfree\u201d him.",
      "In their 855-page verdict, the three handpicked judges focused on Lai's interactions with senior U.S. government officials, including meetings he had at the height of the 2019 protests with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and multiple members of Congress.",
      "Judge Esther Toh said Lai had persistently lobbied Washington to \u201chelp bring down\u201d the Chinese government by imposing sanctions, blockades or other hostile measures \u201cwith the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "She said it was \u201canalogous to the situation where an American national asked for help from Russia to bring down the U.S. government under the guise of helping the state of California.\u201d",
      "The judges also said Lai had used Apple Daily, the now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid he founded in 1995, to publish a series of seditious articles aimed at inciting hatred of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments and \u201cstirring up opposition against them.\u201d",
      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty and spent 52 days testifying, denied using his overseas connections to influence foreign policy on China and Hong Kong. He also said he never intended to \u201cpollute\u201d his readers\u2019 minds but was only commenting on facts.",
      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts. She said he continued to pursue his goals even after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020, but \u201cin a less explicit way.\u201d",
      "Lai\u2019s \u201conly intent\u201d was to \u201cseek the downfall\u201d of the Chinese Communist Party, Toh said, \u201ceven though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people\u201d of China and Hong Kong.",
      "John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, welcomed the conviction, saying it \u201cdemonstrates the justice of the law and upholds Hong Kong\u2019s core values.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai has long used his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",
      "Lai\u2019s son Sebastien Lai said after the verdict that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his father\u2019s health condition and that \u201cthe U.K. government has to do more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to put action behind words and make my father\u2019s release a precondition to closer relationships with China,\u201d he told reporters in London.",
      "'We can bear witness'",
      "Lai\u2019s trial is seen as a test of judicial independence and press freedom in Hong Kong, which was promised its Western-style civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Members of the public lined up overnight to secure tickets to Monday morning\u2019s hearing, with police monitoring the area.",
      "A Hong Kong resident surnamed Chan, who declined to be identified by her full name for fear of retribution, said Lai was the \u201cmost recognizable\u201d face involved in the city\u2019s social movements.",
      "Chan, 27, said outside the court building that she felt a sense of \u201cabsurdity and anger\u201d about the verdict.",
      "\u201cAn individual can\u2019t change much, but we can bear witness,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the least we can do in a limited space.\u201d",
      "Rights groups criticized the conviction, with Human Rights Watch saying it was \u201cboth cruel and a travesty of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticize the Communist Party,\u201d Asia director Elaine Pearson said in a statement.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said the ruling \u201cunderscores Hong Kong\u2019s utter contempt for press freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai\u2019s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy,\u201d Beh Lih Yi, the group\u2019s Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement. \u201cThe risk of him dying from ill health in prison increases as each day passes \u2014 he must be reunited with his family immediately.\u201d",
      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the public slanders and smears against Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary by certain countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is entirely reasonable, fair and lawful\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s judicial organs \u201cto perform their duties, uphold the authority of the law and safeguard national security,\u201d said the spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.",
      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",
      "The Hong Kong government says Lai has received \u201cadequate and comprehensive\u201d medical services in custody and that it separates people such as Lai from other prisoners at their own request to ensure their \u201cpersonal safety and well-being.\u201d",
      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."

    "summary": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader",
    "story": [
      "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "Kast raises expectations, but reality is a different story",
      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

    "story": [
      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."

      "United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is on his way to Berlin, Germany, to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders for peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "Witkoff has spearheaded talks with Ukraine and Russia since President Donald Trump took office in January, but multiple high-level meetings between the U.S. and the two warring nations have yet to produce results as disagreements remain over the content of a peace plan.",
      "Trump, who has pushed for a deal to be in place by Christmas, has signaled that his patience is running thin.",
      "European leaders have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But long-time American allies in Europe have struggled to balance the mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine submitted a 20-point plan to the U.S. on Wednesday, as it sought to balance out a 28-point U.S.-backed plan whose original version was seen as too favorable to Moscow.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s proposal included separate documents on security guarantees, to prevent Russia from attacking again, and on rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-hit cities.",
      "The issue of ceding territory remains a major sticking point in negotiations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met.",
      "Zelenskyy said there was still no common understanding on the land issue and that Ukrainians should vote on any territorial concessions in a referendum.",
      "Russia has continued its bombardment of Ukraine as talks continue. Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered major blackouts on Saturday after a large overnight Russian attack on the power grid across the country.",
      "Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also temporarily lost all offsite power overnight for the 12th time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X: \"It is important that everyone now sees what Russia is doing \u2013 every step they take in terror against our people, all their attacks, for this is clearly not about ending the war. They still aim to destroy our state and inflict maximum pain on our people.\"",
      "Witkoff's visit to Berlin comes as the European Union agreed Friday to indefinitely freeze Russian assets worth 210 billion euros ($246 billion) held in Europe, as it considers using those assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort.",
      "The indefinite freeze appears to be a bid to convince Belgium, where much of that money is held at Euroclear, to agree to plans that would loan a large chunk of the money to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027.",
      "Belgium opposed the plan because it fears legal retaliation by Russia, which has condemned the freezing of its assets as theft, but the agreement includes a guarantee that Belgium would not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Russian lawsuit prove successful.",
      "Zelenskyy said Thursday that negotiators are wrestling with the question of territorial possession in U.S.-led peace talks on ending the war with Russia, including the future of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the world\u2019s 10 biggest atomic plants.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Kyiv on Friday, Zelenskyy said the U.S. is offering as a compromise to create a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in the Ukraine-controlled parts of the eastern Donbas which Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede.",
      "Among the issues Zelenskyy shared were that Russia wants to incorporate the entire Donbas, which Ukraine opposes. He also said the U.S. proposed turning Donbas into a \u201cfree economic zone.\u201d That would mean Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and Russia refrains from entering the parts of Donbas it does not currently occupy.",
      "\u201cThey see it as Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the Donetsk region, and the compromise is supposedly that Russian troops will not enter this part of Donetsk region. They do not know who will govern this territory,\u201d he said, adding that Russia is referring to it as a \u201cdemilitarized zone.\u201d",
      "NATO chief Mark Rutte struck a drastic note Thursday as he urged allies to step up defense efforts. \u201cWe are Russia\u2019s next target,\u201d he said, warning of a conflict that could be on \u201cthe scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.\u201d"

      "But he has made frequent public appearances this year as his treatment continued, hosting President Donald Trump on his second state visit to the U.K. in September.",
      "He also embarked on overseas trips within Europe, marking Holocaust Memorial Day at Auschwitz-Birkenau in January, and praying with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican in October. Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, avoided overseas travel during her last years on the throne, because of her advancing age and a series of health scares.",
      "The palace spokesperson said that Charles had \"taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment,\" continuing with public engagements and overseas tours.",
      "Questions over the health of a monarch would usually be top of the royal news agenda, but Charles has spent the past few months grappling with a public storm surrounding his younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew.",

      "A skydiving trip in Australia took a harrowing turn when one person\u2019s parachute became entangled in the tail of the plane, stranding them at 15,000 feet.",
      "The aircraft, a Cessna 208 Caravan, was carrying one pilot and 17 parachutists, including a camera operator, on Sept. 20 as they attempted a 16-person formation jump over the northernmost part of the state of Queensland.",
      "The camera operator stepped out first, holding on to the fuselage of the plane. When the first skydiver emerged, a handle securing their reserve chute got caught on the plane\u2019s flap over the wing, prompting the chute to deploy inadvertently, according to a video and a report about the incident released Thursday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.",
      "The chute dragged the skydiver backward, knocking the camera operator off the plane and into free fall. The skydiver, who has not been publicly identified, flew straight into the plane\u2019s horizontal stabilizer on the left side of the tail, and the chute became wrapped around it, leaving the skydiver suspended.",
      "The pilot, unaware of what had happened, felt the aircraft suddenly pitch up, and noticed the airspeed rapidly decreasing. Believing the aircraft had stalled, the pilot increased power to regain airspeed but reduced it after being told a skydiver was hung up on the tail.",
      "Thirteen other parachutists exited the plane in quick succession, while two remained in the doorway. They watched as the skydiver used a hook knife \u2014 which is not mandatory equipment \u2014 to cut through 11 ropes connected to the chute, enabling it to tear free in about 50 seconds.",
      "But that was only the first problem.",
      "The skydiver then deployed the main parachute, but it was tangled with the remnants of the reserve chute. The skydiver fell about 7,000 feet from the plane before the main lines fully unwound from the dangling reserve line and functioned normally for the remainder of the descent, the report said.",
      "All parachutists landed safely, including the camera operator and the first skydiver, who sustained minor leg injuries from hitting the horizontal stabilizer.",
      "Meanwhile, the pilot was having control difficulties because the impact of the skydiver had damaged the horizontal stabilizer, which still had part of the reserve chute wrapped around it.",
      "The pilot, who was wearing an emergency parachute, was prepared to bail out from the plane if necessary, but was ultimately able to land safely at Tully Airport, officials said.",
      "According to the report, the Far North Freefall Club, which organized the jump, now requires all parachutists to carry a hook knife.",

      "Will this Saturday see a shocking, sad and incredibly premature end to Mohamed Salah\u2019s career at Liverpool, as one of the greatest players in their history could suddenly say goodbye after a truly incredible meltdown?",
      "It feels like \u201cThe Egyptian King\u201d is about to be dethroned and sensationally leave Liverpool, despite being their star player, becoming a Premier League legend over the last few years and still being one of the best forwards on the planet.",
      "Why?",
      "And how did things devolve so quickly for a club that won the league last season in dominant fashion and then added several star players in the offseason?",
      "Last weekend, Salah fumed publicly about being named as a substitute in Liverpool\u2019s last three games, including never seeing the pitch against Leeds before he lost the plot and was left out of the squad for Liverpool's huge 1-0 win at Inter Milan on Tuesday as a consequence of his incredible rant to reporters.",
      "\u201cI have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,\u201d Salah said. \u201cNow I\u2019m sitting on the bench and I don\u2019t know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" he said.",
      "\u201cHow I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don\u2019t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club. The respect, I want to get it. I don\u2019t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It\u2019s football. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "Imagine Tom Brady being benched by the New England Patriots. Would he be happy about it? Nope. Would he say something like this in public about it? Probably not.",
      "For a current NFL comparison, this would be similar to the Kansas Chiefs benching Patrick Mahomes because of their poor record this season. How would he react?",
      "That is why Salah\u2019s public comments have caused so much uproar. You keep things like this in-house. Now you\u2019ve created one heck of a mess and you\u2019re watching everyone scramble around you, at a time when reigning Premier League champions Liverpool are already scrambling and struggling for wins.",
      "Ahead of their game against Brighton this Saturday, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is noncommittal on whether Salah will be welcomed back into his squad. Slot, who looks genuinely hurt and disappointed with the situation, is one of the nice guys and has let Salah stew on his comments and put the ball in his court when it comes to reconciliation.",
      "Liverpool is unbeaten in the four games since Salah was benched and have genuinely improved their overall performance. Has Slot made the right call? Time will tell. But right now, he has the upper hand.",
      "Given Salah\u2019s truly unbelievable words to reporters, it seems likely he\u2019s played his last game for Liverpool. He will head to Morocco after Saturday\u2019s game as he will captain Egypt during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He\u2019s not scheduled to be back at Liverpool until after the January transfer window opens. The timing of Salah\u2019s meltdown is clearly significant. If he\u2019s going to stay on the bench, he wants out. In Salah\u2019s eyes, Liverpool have a month to figure it out.",
      "Most think we will never see Salah, who has been instrumental in Liverpool's return to glory and its winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy and several other trophies over the last decade, in a Liverpool jersey again.",
      "It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a shame. But even if nobody wants to admit it, it has been heading this way for a few months.",
      "Salah, 33, has been hammered by Liverpool club legends, fans and pretty much everyone else after his rant. Salah, the third-highest scorer in the club's famed history with 250 goals, was not meant to end his legendary Liverpool career this way. He was supposed to lead them to more titles and build on his wonderful 2024-25 season, as he put together one of the greatest campaigns the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "But his drop off this season, like Liverpool\u2019s as a team, has been stark. The reigning champs are languishing in the middle of the pack and have won just two of their last 10 games in the Premier League to all but end their hopes of back-to-back titles.",
      "That downturn has come amid a summer of huge spending on new superstars who have been slow to gel, the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July, which has hit Salah and his Liverpool teammates extremely hard, and the departure of long-time star Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "New superstars Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz (who cost a combined $400 million this summer) played well together as a trio without Salah at Inter Milan in midweek, and Dominik Szoboszlai started in Salah\u2019s place on the right and is a more defensive, robust option. For Liverpool as a team, it\u2019s working right now, sans Salah.",
      "If Salah is to leave Liverpool in the coming weeks, will he even be allowed on the Anfield pitch against Brighton to say goodbye on Saturday? Will most of Liverpool\u2019s fans inside the hallowed ground greet him with warmth? Or will he be lambasted for the way he\u2019s aired Liverpool\u2019s dirty laundry in public? The bitter divide he\u2019s created was the last thing Liverpool needed as they continue to struggle on the pitch.",
      "Does Salah have a point with some of his rant? Maybe.",
      "He\u2019s been nowhere near his best \u2014 most would say that\u2019s been the case since he signed his huge new contract in April \u2014 but neither has the majority of Liverpool\u2019s players this season. But it\u2019s the fact that he sees himself as undroppable and a guaranteed starter no matter what that has upset Slot, Liverpool legends and fans the most.",
      "Even if you think you\u2019re irreplaceable, as all super-talented and driven athletes like Salah usually do, you can\u2019t say it out loud. Or you shouldn\u2019t.",
      "Salah probably deserves some extra leeway amid Liverpool\u2019s struggles. But with the team going through its biggest slump in a  decade, all eyes have been on Salah. And he wasn\u2019t performing. Even if he didn\u2019t think he was the main problem, now he is.",
      "The problem Salah has is that you can clearly make the argument that Liverpool looks like a better, more solid and balanced team since Slot dropped him. It is scoring goals and looking cohesive and fluid in attack. Hence, Salah\u2019s rant to remind everyone just how important and special he is and how he deserves more respect and shouldn\u2019t have to play by the same rules as everyone else. But he does. Even if he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with the manager.",
      "\u201cI said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don\u2019t have any relationship,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn\u2019t want me in the club.\u201d",
      "Compared to his public outburst on his contract situation last November, the difference this time is that most Liverpool fans aren\u2019t on Salah\u2019s side. These comments were so strong that it has probably cost Salah a statue outside Anfield. Will this be remembered 25 years from now? Probably.",
      "But why now? Why did he decide to go all-in on the club and Slot?",
      "Because it\u2019s not only about Salah lashing out and making sure everyone knows he\u2019s not the problem at Liverpool. It\u2019s about him ending this on his terms. He knows he\u2019s heading away on international duty with Egypt for the next few weeks, at least, and he may be sold by the start of January.",
      "Salah wants to control the situation and, in his eyes, these comments have allowed him to do it. It also puts pressure on Slot, and Salah may think that by the time he returns in January, Slot may be fired if Liverpool\u2019s poor form in the league continues.",
      "But after saying what he did, Salah now doesn\u2019t control his Liverpool farewell. If he\u2019s not on the bench and in the matchday squad against Brighton on Saturday, then usually he would not be  permitted to be on the pitch around the game.",
      "\u201cI said to my family, come to the Brighton game \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it,\u201d Salah said. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m going to enjoy that game because I don\u2019t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen when I am there.\u201d",
      "Will Liverpool put Salah\u2019s comments aside to allow him to say an emotional goodbye to fans at Anfield this weekend? That would make the hierarchy and Slot look weak if the rift with Salah isn\u2019t resolved before Saturday.",
      "Salah\u2019s Liverpool career may have already ended the moment he opened his mouth in the mixed zone last weekend, and now he has to deal with the consequences.",
      "If this is it for Salah, it\u2019s a sad end to one of the greatest careers in Premier League history. Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian King looks set to step off his throne quietly and without any kind of adulation or grand send-off from Anfield."
