      "The Trump administration is arguing the government could detain and deport British people under an 18th century wartime act if a president found there was a \u201cBritish invasion\u201d corrupting young Americans",
      "A federal judge hearing arguments Thursday over President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan gang members had a question: Could a president use the same law against a \u201cBritish invasion\u201d that was corrupting young minds?",
      "Jennifer Walker Elrod, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said her query \u2014 a reference to the moral panic in the 1960s over the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands \u2014 was \u201cfanciful,\u201d but a government attorney responded that the president did have that power and courts could not stop him.",
      "\u201cThese sort of questions of foreign affairs and the security of the nation are specifically political issues,\u201d said Drew Ensign, an assistant attorney general who was arguing the administration\u2019s case before the full 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Ensign said it would be up to Congress to check the president in that scenario.",
      "The unexpected and cheeky exchange came in the administration's appeal of a ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative courts in the country, that found Trump inappropriately used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 when he targeted the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua last year.",
      "The act has only been invoked three other times in American history, during the War of 1812 and both world wars. A majority of the three-judge panel agreed in last year's ruling with multiple lower court judges and immigration lawyers who brought the case that it cannot be deployed against a gang rather than a belligerent foreign power.",
      "The administration appealed to the full 5th Circuit, and all 17 judges on the court were present for the arguments in New Orleans on Thursday.",

      "\u201cTren de Aragua is committing ordinary crimes that are being dealt with by law enforcement,\u201d Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the ACLU, told the judges. \u201cThe Alien Enemies Act is about wartime and it's about the military.\u201d",
      "Several of the judges were concerned about second-guessing the president's determination of a threat to the country. Ensign noted the law allows it to be invoked in attempts of \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d and argued that courts should accept a president's declaration that that is happening.",
      "\u201cA predatory incursion is less than an invasion,\u201d Ensign said, arguing that cases involving other laws have determined it happens when foreign fishing boats enter U.S. waters. He also noted that Trump alleged the gang was acting at the behest of recently ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government \u2014 an assertion that has been challenged by some law enforcement analysts.",
      "It's unclear when the circuit will issue its ruling, and the final decision on the constitutionality of Trump's action will likely be made by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The nation's highest court has already had to wade into the tangled legal saga of Trump's invocation of the act twice before. His administration used the act to fly 252 Venezuelans from the United States to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where it contended that U.S. judges had no authority. The Supreme Court ruled that anyone else the administration tried to remove under the act needed a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to challenge their designation as a gang member in court.",
      "The following month, as the administration hurried to prepare another flight from Texas, the high court issued an unusual midnight ruling halting flights. It also barred removals under the act until the 5th Circuit could sort out the proper procedures. The high court never weighed in on the constitutionality of Trump's use of the act, giving the 5th Circuit first crack at that question as well.",

      "Leonardo DiCaprio has picked up his sixth lead actor Oscar nomination for his role in \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",
      "Leonardo DiCaprio picked up his sixth lead actor Oscar nomination Thursday morning for carrying the American masterpiece \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d as the overwhelmed single dad and flustered revolutionary Bob Ferguson.",
      "Ten years after he won best actor for \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d it\u2019s a statistic that puts him in a rarefied group that includes Daniel Day-Lewis. Including his supporting nomination for \u201cWhat\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape,\u201d he\u2019s now among a group of only eight actors, male or female, to have achieved that milestone. Overall, he has eight nominations to his name, including a best picture credit for \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d",
      "But for DiCaprio, a consummate director\u2019s actor who spoke to The Associated Press by phone Thursday morning, the most important thing isn\u2019t even necessarily the accolades but being part of a film that\u2019s as timeless as \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love what I do,\u201d DiCaprio said in a phone interview. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s about trying to be in films that are memorable. This is a great addition to have your peers sort of recognize it.\u201d",
      "In Bob Ferguson, DiCaprio got one of his greatest roles in an already illustrious career. It\u2019s a performance that\u2019s not easy to define but that spotlighted his grasp on his craft to maximum effect, allowing him to be funny, emotional, intimate and utterly authentic, whether he\u2019s yelling about not remembering a passcode, reading his daughter\u2019s friend the riot act or even just wordlessly looking at Sean Penn\u2019s antagonist Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw with all the fear in the world for his daughter in his eyes.",
      "It\u2019s not often that Oscar nominated performances also become cultural touchstones, but this Halloween there were more than a few men and women donning Bob\u2019s plaid bathrobe, black beanie and blockers on the streets around the country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cA film like this, a film that had so much thought put into it for 20 plus years in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s mind, a film that\u2019s so topical and pertinent, a film that I got to work with so many of my heroes, a director who\u2019s my hero? \u2026 It flows freely off the tongue to be able to promote and talk about it. It's a piece of art that you\u2019re proud of and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be in this film.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s one he hopes audiences revisit time and time again, finding new interpretations, new ways of looking and their characters and their intentions. The film received 13 nominations overall, second only to \u201cSinners,\u201d including best picture, best director and supporting actor nominations for Benicio Del Toro and Penn.",
      "One of the bigger snubs of the day, though, was DiCaprio\u2019s co-star Chase Infiniti, an integral part of the film as his daughter Willa who was not nominated for lead actress. DiCaprio said he\u2019d just spoken to her and that she had \u201can amazing attitude\u201d about it.",

      "\u201cShe was the fabric of this movie. She was the heart and soul.

She should be so proud of herself and we\u2019re all so proud of her.\u201d",
      "Between the \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d nominations, it was a big morning for Warner Bros., a studio whose future is uncertain, with many wondering if films like \u201cOne Battle\u201d would be made under Netflix, or if talent like Anderson or DiCaprio would be part of it. DiCaprio demurred on commenting specifically on the pending acquisition, instead championing original filmmaking and theatrical moviegoing.",
      "\u201cTo me what matters is great ideas and original filmmaking. I think there\u2019s this tide of change that is going to happen no matter how we feel about it,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the theatrical experience to immerse you and have the rest of the world disappear and feel part of something else, something bigger, something different. That\u2019s the magic of movies. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s our greatest art form and I hope the theatrical experience remains alive, but that\u2019s up to audiences and their appreciation of that art form.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio might have a tendency to be turned into memes sometimes, whether it\u2019s that image of him walking in \u201cInception\u201d or even animatedly talking to someone at the Golden Globes about \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d (Laughing, he told the AP that he was talking to a friend who will remain anonymous).",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s because he saves it all for the screen and for great filmmakers, whether it\u2019s Anderson, Martin Scorsese or Christopher Nolan. In a dark theater, 30 feet tall and impossible to look away from, all the noise evaporates.",

      "Chris Pine stars in and produces Rachel Lambert's film \u201cCarousel,\u201d which premieres Thursday at the Sundance Film Festival",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Chris Pine gets a lot of scripts sent his way, but when Rachel Lambert\u2019s \u201cCarousel\u201d landed on his proverbial desk it was like he\u2019d stumbled on something from a different filmmaking era. In Lambert\u2019s lyrical prose was a story that, to him, felt very Robert Redford, very \u201cOrdinary People.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy favorite word for this film is quotidian,\u201d Pine said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a film in which nothing happens and yet everything happens.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s fitting then that \u201cCarousel\u201d is having its world premiere Thursday at the Sundance Film Festival, where it is seeking distribution. The film is a story about love in all its messy incarnations, centered on a single father in Cleveland, Ohio, whose small medical practice is struggling, whose divorce is complicated and whose teenage daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson) is slipping into depression when his high school girlfriend ( Jenny Slate ) comes back to town and they start up again.",
      "Pine felt himself leaning into the script, wanting to know more about the characters and the filmmaker behind it. After watching Lambert\u2019s previous film, \u201cSometimes I Think About Dying,\u201d he saw a filmmaker whose cinematic vision was so unique, so distinctly her own that he joined \u201cCarousel\u201d not just as the star but a producer as well.",
      "Lambert had admired Pine from afar for years, for his intelligence and sensitivity on screen, and saw potential for him in the part of Noah.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a rareness to him that I don\u2019t see very often in performers,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cHe reminds me of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant, these sort of towers of performers.\u201d",
      "The actual experience of it turned out to be more special than she could have dreamed. Yes, he showed up as an actor, generous and receptive, but he also became a protector of sorts as well. Knowing how much Lambert wanted to shoot both in America and on film, two relatively expensive dreams for an indie, he made his own participation contingent on celluloid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous act that I think about a lot,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThere are very few films shot in America and there are very few films shot on film \u2026 it lends a kind of extra emotional layer to the viewing experience.\u201d",
      "For Lambert, shooting on film was an act of preservation. This was a story that she dreamed up during COVID lockdowns at her childhood home, a location she also used in \u201cCarousel.\u201d The homespun feeling of it added a texture and intimacy to the environment, whether it was using her mom\u2019s frozen fruit as a prop or literally chopping down a tree in the backyard, as Slate\u2019s character Rebecca does at one point.",
      "\u201cYou just plunk right into whatever that closeness or intimacy is,\u201d Slate said.",
      "Chemistry is always a gamble, especially in indies where there\u2019s never enough time or money, but Lambert was blown away by just how well Pine and Slate worked out as these two characters attempting to start up again after many years apart.",
      "\u201cWe just had an immediate affinity for one another,\u201d Pine said. \u201cJenny is so smart, and I\u2019m sort of a lover of smart people, so immediately she had me. And she likes to laugh and she makes me giggle. So we just had a really, really easy time getting to know one another.\u201d",

      "While actors can wax poetic about how much they like and respect one another, ultimately it's what\u2019s on screen that counts. Lambert remembered getting chills (the good kind) when shooting Rebecca and Noah\u2019s second first kiss.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t it so good to have kissing on screen,\u201d Slate said. \u201cShooting that scene felt to me like it was in slow motion. It felt like such a beautiful thing to enact, really. But I mean, also that\u2019s something that you get with another actor who\u2019s really, really focused on landing it just right.\u201d",
      "Of course, love is never as simple as it is in the movies, and Lambert wanted to reflect that in \u201cCarousel.\u201d At its heart there is a central romantic love story, but there are other love stories refracted throughout, through their families and professions. None are obstacles that need to be overcome exactly, but they\u2019re part of the fabric of a life.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this mantra I have already: 'Have you ever wanted something so much in life you do all you could not to get it? That\u2019s what Noah is going through,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cHe wants so much to love this person, Rebecca, to feel love, to feel renewed. But there\u2019s all these other repairs he must attend to and all these fears he must attend to. I wanted to take that seriously.\u201d",
      "Lambert is hesitant to prescribe what an audience might feel when watching her film. For her actors, though, it meant one of the richer creative experiences of their careers, getting to hone their craft in a way that might really resonate with audiences and speak to the human experience.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an earnest, heartfelt, non-jaded, non-cool investigation of the deepest fundamentals of what we humans do on the planet, which is, you know, how do we love?\u201d Pine said. \u201cThere\u2019s no gimmick here. There\u2019s no hold up, no spaceship, no great effects. The metronome to this film is very paced and deliberate and it requires a patience to allow yourself to be drawn into the spectacle of human beings.\u201d",
      "For Lambert, Sundance is a homecoming and the only place she\u2019d have wanted it. \u201cCarousel\u201d is a proudly independent American film made on location, and Sundance is, whether in Colorado or Utah, the quintessential independent American film festival.",
      "\u201cWhat better platform does America provide for cinematic artists?\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThis film is American and, quietly, has a lot to say about America right now, and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",

Both \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d should lead Warner Bros. to a record haul even as the studio prepares for its sale to Netflix.

But in \u201cMel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\u201d Judd Apatow dutifully and affectionately celebrates the laugh-filled life of a comedy legend who\u2019s still here to tell the story \u2014 and the jokes \u2014 himself.",
      "\u201cThe 99 Year Old Man,\u201d which debuts Thursday in two parts on HBO and HBO Max, is a big-hearted tribute to Brooks, an indefatigable comic force who did more than most anyone to lighten the mood of the 20th century. At 99 (he\u2019ll turn 100 in June), Brooks remains a remarkably great raconteur.",
      "One of the cleverest tricks by directors Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio is playing some of Brooks\u2019 stories \u2014 like a memorable lunch with Cary Grant \u2014 across not just his sit-down interviews with them, but over multiple talk show appearances. He\u2019s been telling some of these jokes for decades. It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re still good.",
      "\u201cThe 99 Year Old Man\u201d takes the whole life in: the formative childhood in Brooklyn; the Sid Caesar-aided entry to \u201cYour Show of Shows\u201d; the lifelong friendship with Carl Reiner; the 2000 Year Old Man sketches; \u201cThe Producers\u201d; the marriage to Anne Bancroft; \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d and beyond.",
      "But if there\u2019s an ongoing question in \u201cThe 99 Year Old Man,\u201d it\u2019s posed early by Apatow, who appears on-screen as Brooks\u2019 interviewer. Do people really know who he is? \u201cNo,\u201d Brooks answers straightaway.",
      "That might sound like an odd answer for someone who has so unabashedly lived nearly a century in the public eye. Yet Brooks has been such a non-stop performer that it can sometimes be difficult to see where the schtick ends and the self begins.",
      "One person describes Brooks, as a newborn, thinking the delivery doctor smacking him on the rear was applause. In an earlier clip, an interviewer laments Brooks\u2019 apparent lack of introspection. He replies that he\u2019s merely \u201ca coalescence of vapor.\u201d When Brooks gave his Oscar speech, for the screenplay to \u201cThe Producers,\u201d he said he would speak from the heart: \u201cBa-bum, ba-bum.\u201d",
      "So is what\u2019s inside Brooks just jokes? I\u2019d say \u2014 and I think this is what makes \u201cThe 99 Year Old Man\u201d not just an exhaustive documentary but a moving and even stirring one \u2014 it\u2019s more the opposite. Brooks\u2019 comedy, from the 2000 Year Old Man to \u201cHistory of the World, Part I,\u201d has always derived from something deeper, more personal and intrinsically Jewish than its slapstick qualities sometimes have suggested.",

Soon his eclectic sound could be heard across films and television shows like \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d and HBO's \u201cInsecure.\u201d Since then, Duckwrth's music has gone against the grain, seamlessly blending elements of hip-hop, funk, rock and soul throughout his projects.",
      "Duckwrth's latest album, \u201cAll American F\u2014Boy,\u201d is nominated at the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Feb. 1 for best immersive audio album, a category that honors the technical work of albums mixed using multichannel audio recordings.",
      "If they win, the trophy will be awarded to immersive mix engineer Andrew Law, who formatted the album's previously mixed stereo recording for Dolby Atmos surround sound, a three-dimensional experience that allows listeners to feel as if they are at the center of the songs' layered instruments and melodies.",
      "\u201cThe difficult part is you have to keep the essence of the actual song so that when people listen to it on headphones or on other mediums, and not like in the (Dolby Atmos) studio, that it still sounds like the song without making it too crazy,\u201d said Law. \u201cI try to take the approach of keeping the song how it was meant to be heard. And then turn it into a big soundscape and something really, really fun when you\u2019re sitting in an Atmos studio.\u201d",
      "The project is immersive in more ways than one. While brainstorming his next project, Duckwrth knew he wanted to center it on a character who was a bit more \u201cbrash and more a Sid Vicious type.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I feel I had to find a way to blend what they already knew me for,\u201d he said. \u201cI told my friend I gotta trick people, I gotta secretly drop a rock album, but people not know it\u2019s a rock album.\u201d",
      "At the time, he was listening to audiobooks, like George Orwell's \u201c1984,\u201d and wanted the album to feel like the layered soundscapes in a film or audiobook. So, he sat down and, over the course of 2 \u00bd years, created his own audio drama within the album, starring himself and featuring narration from actor LaKeith Stanfield. The album was produced alongside BLK ODYSSY and 2Fresh, featuring artists like Taner\u00e9lle, Sherwyn, Tommy Newport and IDK.",

      "A detective must prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge in the new film \u201cMercy,\u201d starring Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson",
      "It\u2019s a bold filmmaking choice to have a countdown clock on the screen for most of your movie.",
      "In the best-case scenario for a movie like \u201cMercy,\u201d in which a Los Angeles detective has prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge within said time limit, it heightens the tension. Who hasn\u2019t gotten sweaty palms in, say, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie when the bomb is ticking down and Tom Cruise still hasn\u2019t cleared the building? Why not just extend it for the duration?",
      "Perhaps in a better movie it might have worked. Sadly in \u201cMercy,\u201d in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s an ever-present reminder of just how much longer you must endure until you too are free of Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson and that chair.",
      "In \u201cMercy\u2019s\u201d near-future Los Angeles, AI has been adopted by law enforcement and the judicial system to more efficiently clean up the city\u2019s crime and blight problem. It\u2019s a potent and not too far-flung idea that might have been a fascinating and provocative premise for a movie attempting to grapple with the implications of so-called progress that had the potential to be a worthy companion to another Cruise movie, \u201cMinority Report.\u201d But that would have required a more serious script than screenwriter Marco van Belle\u2019s and more vision than filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov managed to muster.",
      "When Pratt\u2019s character, Chris Raven, wakes up, barefoot and strapped into an electric chair sitting in the middle of an oddly large room that looks a bit like the holodeck, he\u2019s informed by an IMAX-sized AI judge (Ferguson) that he has 90 minutes to prove he didn\u2019t kill his wife (Annabelle Wallis). In this world, the incarcerated are guilty until proved innocent. They\u2019ve cut lawyers and juries out of the equation as well. Instead, the accused have everyone\u2019s digital footprint at their disposal to help build their own case. For Raven, that means everything from ring cam footage to his teenage daughter\u2019s secret Instagram account.",
      "Unfortunately for Raven, he woke up with some gaps in his memory between angrily busting into his home to confront his wife about something and being arrested and bludgeoned at a bar later that day. Raven was also one of the original champions of the AI judge system, which in a more curious script might have resulted in some real stakes. This story is more hung up on increasingly tortured plot contrivances, however, including Raven\u2019s drinking problem following the death of a partner killed on the job. To its credit, the story does really keep it ambiguous as to whether Raven did it or not, but to say that it earns any sort of investment in the outcome is a stretch.",

At times, it feels as tedious as watching a stranger\u2019s increasingly frustrating call with a robotic customer service representative play out in real time.",
      "For how reliant this movie is on screens and keeping Pratt alone, one might assume that \u201cMercy\u201d was a socially distanced, COVID-era leftover instead of something made in 2024. Kali Reis, playing another LAPD agent named Jaq who decides to help Raven investigate on the ground is the one that gets to be out in the real-world chasing leads and hunches. But for the most part, she\u2019s seen only through FaceTime and bodycam footage. Like Raven, we\u2019re largely stuck in the chair watching things play out on multiple screens, acutely aware of just how much time is left.",

      "NEW YORK -- In a dispute of operatic proportions, the production team of Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera ordered their names stripped from programs over a restaging decision, and the company intends to bring back sets of a retired 2009 version.",
      "Director Carrie Cracknell\u2019s production opened on Dec. 31, 2023, in her Met debut, moving the action from early 19th century Seville, Spain, to a contemporary American industrial town. The character Escamillo is a rodeo star, not a bullfighter, in this staging.",
      "When the production opened, Escamillo entered in a red Jaguar convertible that crossed the stage as he started his famous Toreador\u2019s Song. He was accompanied by his entourage in three pickup trucks, all the vehicles moving on wires guided by a computer.",
      "In the restaging decision, the Jaguar and two trucks were eliminated. Escamillo walked in with his followers, some pushing a motorcycle. One of the pickup trucks from the original staging was kept, in a stationary position throughout the act.",
      "\u201cWe were furious,\u201d set designer Michael Levine said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my name attached to the production because it\u2019s not a representation of the original artistic intent. \u2026 I\u2019ve never come across anything on this level where they literally change the basic concept.\u201d",
      "Levine said the Met's assistant general manager for production notified him of the change last fall, just ahead of the Oct. 28 opening.",
      "\u201cI get a phone call from John Sellars saying: We\u2019re in terrible financial straits and we have to make cuts to the opera. We are going to cut the automation of the trucks,\u201d Levine said.",
      "Levine and Cracknell attempted to find a solution such as putting the cars on the stage turntable but said the Met wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate. Levine said his contract specified changes could not be made after opening night and he removed his name. Levine said the Met then gave the rest of the production team one day to decide whether they would follow suit.",
      "Cracknell, Tom Scutt (costumes), Guy Hoare (lighting), rocafilm/Roland Horvath (projections) and Ann Yee (choreography) also asked their names to be dropped. After the names of the conductor and chorus master, the only person listed in programs was revival stage director Melanie Bacaling, who was an assistant stage director when the production premiered, followed by several inches of white space.",
      "\u201cIt was really an economic decision,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said of the change. \u201cWe decided it was incredibly expensive to run, and it was not particularly effective. We decided to cut it.\u201d",
      "Gelb said the savings was more than $300,000.",
      "On Tuesday, Gelb announced 22 layoffs to the Met's administrative staff of 284, 4-15% temporary salary cuts and the reduction next season by one opera to 17. The moves are projected to save $15 million this fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Valentino Garavani\u2019s death cast a long shadow over the opening day of Paris Fashion Week menswear Tuesday, with front-row guests and industry figures mourning the passing of one of the last towering names of 20th-century couture \u2014 an Italian designer whose working life was closely entwined with the Paris runways.",
      "Valentino, 93, died at his Rome residence, the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said in a statement announcing his death. While he built his house in Rome, he spent decades presenting collections in France.",
      "He \u201cwas one of the last big couturiers who really embodied what was fashion in the 20th century,\u201d said Pierre Groppo, fashion editor-in-chief at Vanity Fair France.",
      "On a day meant to sell the future, many guests said they were thinking about what fashion has lost: the couturier as a living institution.",
      "Groppo pointed to the codes that made Valentino instantly legible \u2014 \u201cthe dots, the ruffles, the knots\u201d \u2014 and to a generation of designers who, he said, \u201cin a way, invented what is celebrity culture.\u201d",
      "Valentino\u2019s vision was built on a simple idea: make women look luminous, then make the moment unforgettable.",
      "He dressed Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor, among others, fixed his signature \u201cValentino red\u201d in the public imagination, and \u2014 through his decades-long partnership with Giancarlo Giammetti \u2014 helped turn the designer himself into part of the spectacle, as recognizable as the clients in his front row.",
      "Prominent fashion writer Luke Leitch framed the loss in similarly outsized terms, calling Valentino \u201cthe last of the fashion \u2018leviathans of that generation\u2019,\u201d and saying it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the end of a certain class of designer: figures whose names could carry a global house, and whose authority came not from viral speed but from permanence.",
      "Trained in Paris before founding his maison in Rome, Valentino became a rare bridge figure: Italian by origin, but fluent in the rituals that made Paris couture an institution. His career moved between those two capitals of elegance, bringing Roman grandeur into a system that still treats fashion not only as commerce, but as ceremony.",
      "Even as he aged, the house\u2019s founder kept turning up at its couture and ready-to-wear shows, as observed by one Associated Press journalist \u2014 until he eventually retreated from public life, all the while radiating quiet grandeur from his front-row seat.",
      "For some in Paris on Tuesday, the loss felt personal precisely because Valentino\u2019s world was never only Italian.",
      "Groppo recalled the designer as \u201cvery much more than a fashion brand,\u201d adding: \u201cIt was a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That lifestyle \u2014 couture polish, social glamour, and the conviction that elegance could be a form of power \u2014 remains a reference point even as fashion accelerates toward louder branding and faster cycles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite sad as he\u2019s so important to the fashion industry, and he contributed a lot and I cannot forget the stunning red he created,\u201d said Lolo Zhang, a Chinese fashion influencer attending Louis Vuitton \u2019s show in Paris.",
      "\u201cHe always celebrated pure beauty, and architecture for the silhouette, and how he used color. The old era just passed by.\u201d",
      "Other guests described a delayed realization \u2014 the kind that arrives only when a figure who seemed permanent is suddenly gone.",

And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\u201d he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t airborne, a stance it didn\u2019t officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",

But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",

      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",
      "In 2016, the government began allowing two children per couple and raised the limit to three children in 2021. But it has proven more difficult to reverse the mentality of people than the policy.",

      "China is far from the only country facing the challenges of an aging population. Around the world, as people get wealthier, they tend to want fewer, or no, children.",
      "But the one-child policy, leading to a preference for sons, has also created a gender imbalance in the one-child generation.",
      "Now, some from that generation, once dubbed \u201clittle emperors\u201d because they were so fussed over, face the pressure of meeting the expectations, including financial, of being the only child.",
      "As they reach their 30s and 40s, there is only one child to support two parents, and in some cases, up to four grandparents. For some, this can lead to anxiety and depression, Fong said.",
      "\u201cThe little emperor at some point becomes the slave,\u201d she said.",
      "China is an aging society that will likely face a major shortfall in the coming decades: not enough people of working age to support a growing population of retirees. That could burden government finances and pension systems.",
      "The government has launched a slew of polices to try to boost the birth rate, from eliminating a tax exemption for condoms to giving cash subsidies to couples who have children. But the experience of other countries shows that it's difficult to turn around a declining birth rate.",

      "A Portland, Oregon, boy is struggling to recover from infant botulism after drinking contaminated ByHeart baby formula donated through a program that aims to help poor and homeless families.",
      "Ashaan Carter, now 10 months old, was hospitalized twice and remains on a feeding tube after contracting the dangerous infection that has sickened more than 50 babies across the U.S.",
      "His mother, Angel Carter, said she received a can of ByHeart formula from a case worker with the Oregon Department of Human Services in early November, days before a nationwide recall of the product.",
      "Carter, who receives state food and housing assistance, said she had been exclusively breastfeeding her son, but her milk supply was waning. The case worker told the 27-year-old that the ByHeart formula \u201cwas closest to breast milk\u201d and could help, she said.",
      "\u201cI accepted it thinking, \u2018OK, I\u2019m hoping my baby can get on a bottle,'\" Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been all downhill since then.\u201d",
      "State officials wouldn\u2019t comment on Carter\u2019s case, but they acknowledged that the agency received ByHeart formula from PDX Diaper Bank. That was one of nearly two dozen nonprofit groups nationwide who are part of ByHeart\u2019s \u201cOpenHearted Initiative\u201d that donated formula to \u201cfamilies in need,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Since June 2022, nearly 24,000 cans of formula have been distributed to groups that aid homeless and other vulnerable families, the company said. All the company's products have been recalled since production began in March 2022 because of potential contamination.",
      "Soon after consuming the ByHeart formula, Ashaan developed severe constipation and muscle weakness, becoming so limp that he couldn\u2019t move his head, Carter said.",
      "After a trip to an emergency room, he was sent to Randall Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. Doctors there diagnosed him with presumed infant botulism tied to the ByHeart formula, according to Dr. Sylvia Peterson-Perry, a family medicine doctor who delivered Ashaan and cares for him and his mother.",
      "He was treated with BabyBIG, an IV medication that provides antibodies to the infection to stop the progress of the disease.",
      "Ashaan was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in November and discharged without a feeding tube. His health rapidly declined, including dramatic weight loss, and he was hospitalized again in December. He got so sick that his mother was afraid he would die.",
      "\u201cHe was just withering away,\u201d Carter said.",

      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters takes effect Saturday",
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters took effect Saturday, marking a historic moment for ocean conservation after nearly two decades of negotiations.",
      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",
      "The treaty entered into force 120 days after it reached the threshold of ratification by 60 countries in September. As of Friday, 83 countries had ratified it, including the recent addition of major maritime powers such as China and Japan.",
      "The treaty creates the first framework for establishing Marine Protected Areas on the high seas, which make up about two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean. Currently, only around 1% of these international waters are protected.",
      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, countries must now promote the treaty\u2019s conservation goals when they participate in other international bodies that regulate ocean activities, such as regional fisheries organizations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Authority.",
      "While key institutions like the treaty\u2019s secretariat and scientific body are still being developed, countries can begin preparing proposals for Marine Protected Areas immediately. Potential sites include the Emperor Seamounts in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic and the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges off South America.",
      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is celebrating the latest developments in Syria, where the new government has effectively defeated a major Kurdish-led force with an abrupt offensive.",
      "Ankara has long viewed armed groups led by Kurds \u2014 an ethnic minority with large populations in eastern Turkey, Iraq and northern Syria \u2014 as a threat as Turkey as fought to quell the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, whose decades\u2011long insurgency cost tens of thousands of lives.",
      "Coming just a few months after a Kurdish militant group in Turkey agreed to lay down its arms, the collapse of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces is a major step toward Ankara\u2019s regional goals.",
      "In just two weeks, Syria\u2019s Kurdish\u2011led Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 once the United States' main partner against the Islamic State group in Syria \u2014 lost most of its territory in northern Syria to an offensive launched by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "The SDF was then forced to accept a deal under which it would dissolve and merge its tens of thousands with Syrian government\u2019s military as individuals rather than in a bloc, after the failure of months-long negotiations on the integration of its troops into the new Syrian army.",
      "The SDF was established a decade ago with U.S. support as a coalition of militias to fight IS. Its backbone was made up of a Syrian Kurdish armed group affiliated with the PKK.",
      "Al-Sharaa took power after the ouster of the Assad government in December 2024, and has been consolidating authority while dealing with challenges from the remnants of pro-Assad groups as well as some former opposition groups that want to maintain autonomy from the state. In particular, minority religious and ethnic groups have viewed the Sunni Arab-led government with suspicion. Turkey has been a key backer of al\u2011Sharaa, providing political and military support to strengthen his government.",
      "Washington declined to intervene on behalf of the Kurdish group, shifting its support to the nascent government and focusing on brokering a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the PKK-linked SDF has essentially lost its influence and territorial hold is certainly a very favorable outcome for Turkey,\u201d said Sinan Ulgen, director of the Istanbul-based EDAM research center. \u201cThe extension of the capabilities of the new Syrian government is also another favorable outcome.\u201d",
      "Ulgen cautioned, however, that the Syrian government\u2019s recent gains could prove temporary if al-Sharaa fails to stabilize the northeast of the country.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan extended congratulations to the Syrian government in remarks to his ruling party\u2019s legislators on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFrom the very beginning, Turkey has strongly defended the existence of a single Syrian state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have repeatedly declared that we will not consent to any separatist structure along our southern borders that poses a threat to our country\u2019s security.\"",
      "Turkey not only benefited from the developments but played a supportive role, advising the Syrian government during operations that led to the withdrawal of SDF forces from Aleppo, Turkish security officials said.",
      "Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency remained in contact with the Syrian administration to prevent harm to civilians and the safe evacuation of SDF members and their families, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Turkey also kept in touch with the United States, the international coalition against the Islamic State group, and other regional countries during the offensive, they said.",

      "Also key to the Syrian government's success was the willingness of the U.S. to see a former ally dismantled. Experts say the SDF counted on Washington's support when it rejected an earlier deal proposed by al-Sharaa.",
      "Erdogan's warm personal ties with U.S. President Donald Trump likely helped win the U.S. President over, Ulgen said. But he added that the shift in U.S. policy was based on the White House\u2019s assessment that its \u201cinterlocutor in Syria should be the new government and not a non-state entity.\u201d",
      "The development also came despite tensions between Turkey and Israel over Syria.",
      "Some SDF representatives openly called for Israeli intervention during the recent clashes, citing Israel\u2019s past support for the Druze community during violence in Sweida province in southern Syria, but Israel also chose to stand aside.",
      "Ulgen said a key turning point was a recent meeting between Syrian and Israeli officials in Paris, during which Syria effectively recognized Israel\u2019s zone of influence along its southern border.",
      "Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, an expert on Turkey at the German Marshall Fund, also said Syria and Israel reached a \u201ctacit agreement\u201d on the SDF during the meeting in Paris but added that the United States\u2019 support to the Syrian government played a key role.",
      "Turkish officials now hope that the integration of the SDF into Syrian government structures will help advance Ankara's latest peace initiative aimed at ending the conflict with the PKK.",
      "In May, the PKK announced that it would disarm and disband as part of reconciliation effort, following a call by its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan. The PKK staged a symbolic disarmament ceremony in northern Iraq in the summer, and later announced that it was withdrawing its remaining fighters from Turkey to Iraq.",
      "The SDF, however, rejected pressure to follow suit, insisting that Ocalan\u2019s call applied only to the PKK.",
      "\u201cNow that handicap has been eliminated\u201d Ulgen said. The analyst however, cautioned that Ankara must still address potential frustrations among its own Kurdish population should tensions arise in Syria.",
      "On Tuesday, Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish party, warned that any violence against Kurds in Syria would undermine peace efforts in Turkey.",
      "\u201cAt a time when we are talking about internal peace and calm, can there really be peace if Kurds are being massacred in Syria and the feelings of Kurds in Turkey are ignored?\u201d said the party's co-chair, Tulay Hatimogullari.",

      "Ingram had a long criminal history including domestic violence and police had checked on him multiple times while he was out on bail, state Police Assistant Commissioner Andrew Holland said. \u201cIn the time that he has been on bail, he has complied with every condition,\u201d he told reporters in Lake Cargelligo.",

      "Icebreakers are essential for navigating Greenland's icy seas, but the U.S. faces a challenge with its limited fleet",
      "BRUSSELS -- The cold, hard reality facing any U.S., NATO or European plans for Greenland is the ice. It chokes harbors, entombs minerals, and freezes shorelines into minefields of white and blue shards that threaten ships all year.",
      "And the only way to break through all that is, well, with icebreakers: enormous ships with burly engines, reinforced hulls, and heavy bows that can crush and cleave ice.",
      "But the United States has only three such vessels, one of which is so decrepit as to be barely usable. It has entered agreements to obtain 11 more, but can only source additional ships from adversaries \u2014 or allies it has recently rebuffed.",
      "Despite toning down his rhetoric, U.S. President Donald Trump seems set on the U.S. owning Greenland for security and economic reasons: to keep what he calls \u201cthe big, beautiful piece of ice\u201d out of the hands of Moscow and Beijing, to secure a strategic Arctic location for U.S. assets, and to extract the island\u2019s mineral wealth including rare earths.",
      "Without specifying any plan, he told world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that \u201cto get to this rare earth you got to go through hundreds of feet of ice.\u201d",
      "Yet there is no meaningful way to do that \u2014 or anything else in the semiautonomous Danish territory \u2014 without icebreakers\u2019 crucial ability to cut trails through frozen seas.",
      "Even if they decided to surge U.S. material into Greenland tomorrow, \u201cthey would have two or three years gap in which they\u2019re not really able to access the island most of the time,\u201d said Alberto Rizzi, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cOn a map, Greenland looks surrounded by sea, but the reality is that the sea is full of ice,\u201d he said.",
      "If the U.S. wants more icebreakers, there are only four options: the shipyards of strategic adversaries China and Russia or longtime allies Canada and Finland, both of whom have recently weathered blistering criticism and threats of tariffs by Trump over Greenland.",
      "Icebreakers are expensive to design, build, operate and maintain and require a skilled workforce that can only be found in certain places like Finland, with expertise forged in the frigid Baltic Sea.",
      "Finland has built roughly 60% of the world\u2019s fleet of more than 240 icebreakers and designed half the remainder, Rizzi said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very niche capabilities that they developed as a necessity first and then they have been able to turn it into geoeconomic leverage,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has the world\u2019s largest fleet with about 100 vessels, including colossal ships powered by nuclear reactors. Second comes Canada, which is set to double its fleet to around 50 icebreakers, according to a 2024 report by Aker Arctic, a Helsinki-based icebreaker design firm.",
      "\u201cOur design and engineering work order books are pretty full at the moment and the near future looks promising,\" said Jari Hurttia, business manager at Aker Arctic, as he describes rising interest in the firm's \u201cunrivalled special competence which is not available anywhere else in the world.\u201d",

      "During his first administration, Trump prioritized the U.S. military\u2019s acquisition of ice-capable vessels, a strategy that the Biden administration followed up on by signing an agreement called the Ice PACT with Helsinki and Ottawa to deliver 11 icebreakers constructed by two corporate consortiums with Finnish designs.",
      "Four would be built in Finland, while seven would be constructed in a Canadian-owned billion-dollar \u201cAmerican Icebreaker Factory\u201d in Texas as well as a shipyard in Mississippi under joint U.S.-Canadian ownership.",
      "Any mining of critical minerals would face high costs in the harsh conditions at sea and on land in Greenland. Investments there would take years if not decades to pay off, Lanteigne said.",

      "Jared Kushner envisions a rebuilt Gaza with high-rises, a coastline that attracts tourists and a bustling port",
      "JERUSALEM -- Modern cities with sleek high-rises, a pristine coastline that attracts tourists and a state-of-the-art port that jut into the Mediterranean. This is what Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, says Gaza could become, according to a presentation he gave at an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "In his 10-minute speech on Thursday, Kushner claimed it would be possible \u2014 if there's security \u2014 to quickly rebuild Gaza's cities, which are now in ruins after more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\u201cIn the Middle East, they build cities like this ... in three years,\" said Kushner, who helped broker the ceasefire in place since October. \u201cAnd so stuff like this is very doable, if we make it happen.\u201d",
      "That timeline is at odds with what the United Nations and Palestinians expect will be a very long process to rehabilitate Gaza. Across the territory of roughly 2 million people, former apartment blocks are hills of rubble, unexploded ordnance lurks beneath the wreckage, disease spreads because of sewage-tainted water and city streets look like dirt canyons.",
      "The United Nations Office for Project Services says Gaza has more than 60 million tons of rubble, enough to fill nearly 3,000 container ships. That will take over seven years to clear, they say, and then additional time is needed for demining.",
      "Kushner spoke as Trump and an assortment of world leaders gathered to ratify the charter of the Board of Peace, the body that will oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction process.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the presentation, and some questions raised by it:",
      "Kushner said his reconstruction plan would only work if Gaza has \u201csecurity\u201d \u2014 a big \u201cif.\u201d",
      "It remains uncertain whether Hamas will disarm, and Israeli troops fire upon Palestinians in Gaza on a near-daily basis.",
      "Officials from the militant group say they have the right to resist Israeli occupation. But they have said they would consider \u201cfreezing\u201d their weapons as part of a process to achieve Palestinian statehood.",
      "Since the latest ceasefire took effect Oct. 10, Israeli troops have killed at least 470 Palestinians in Gaza, including young children and women, according to the territory's Health Ministry. Israel says it has opened fire in response to violations of the ceasefire, but dozens of civilians have been among the dead.",
      "In the face of these challenges, the Board of Peace has been working with Israel on \u201cde-escalation,\u201d Kushner said, and is turning its attention to the demilitarization of Hamas \u2014 a process that would be managed by the U.S.-backed Palestinian committee overseeing Gaza.",
      "It's far from certain that Hamas will yield to the committee, which goes by the acronym NCAG and is envisioned eventually handing over control of Gaza to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Hamas says it will dissolve the government to make way, but has been vague about what will happen to its forces or weapons. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Another factor that could complicate disarmament: the existence of competing armed groups in Gaza, which Kushner's presentation said would either be dismantled or \u201cintegrated into NCAG.\u201d During the war, Israel has supported armed groups and gangs of Palestinians in Gaza in what it says is a move to counter Hamas.",
      "Without security, Kushner said, there would be no way to draw investors to Gaza and or stimulate job growth. The latest joint estimate from the U.N., the European Union and the World Bank is that rebuilding Gaza will cost $70 billion.",
      "Reconstruction would not begin in areas that are not fully disarmed, one of Kushner\u2019s slides said.",

      "When unveiling his plan for Gaza's reconstruction, Kushner did not say how demining would be handled or where Gaza\u2019s residents would live as their areas are being rebuilt. At the moment, most families are sheltering in a stretch of land that includes parts of Gaza City and most of Gaza's coastline.",
      "In Kushner's vision of a future Gaza, there would be new roads and a new airport \u2014 the old one was destroyed by Israel more than 20 years ago \u2014 plus a new port, and an area along the coastline designated for \u201ctourism\u201d that is currently where most Palestinians live. The plan calls for eight \u201cresidential areas\u201d interspersed with parks, agricultural land and sports facilities.",
      "Also highlighted by Kushner were areas for \u201cadvanced manufacturing,\u201d \u201cdata centers,\u201d and an \u201cindustrial complex,\u201d though it is not clear what industries they would support.",
      "Kushner said construction would first focus on building \u201cworkforce housing\u201d in Rafah, a southern city that was decimated during the war and is currently controlled by Israeli troops. He said rubble-clearing and demolition were already underway there.",
      "Kushner did not address whether demining would occur. The United Nations says unexploded shells and missiles are everywhere in Gaza, posing a threat to people searching through rubble to find their relatives, belongings, and kindling.",
      "Rights groups say rubble clearance and demining activities have not begun in earnest in the zone where most Palestinians live because Israel has prevented the entry of heavy machinery.",
      "After Rafah will come the reconstruction of Gaza City, Kushner said, or \u201cNew Gaza,\u201d as his slide calls it. The new city could be a place where people will \u201chave great employment,\" he said.",
      "Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an international lawyer and expert in conflict resolution, described the board\u2019s initial concept for redeveloping Gaza as \u201ctotally unrealistic\u201d and an indication Trump views it from a real estate developer's perspective, not a peacemaker's.",
      "A project with so many high-rise buildings would never be acceptable to Israel because each would provide a clear view of its military bases near the border, said Bar-Yaacov, who is an associate fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.",
      "What's more, Kushner\u2019s presentation said the NCAG would eventually hand off oversight of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority after it makes reforms. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has adamantly opposed any proposal for postwar Gaza that involves the Palestinian Authority. And even in the West Bank, where it governs, the Palestinian Authority is widely unpopular because of corruption and perceived collaboration with Israel.",

      "The Yanacocha Reserve in the Ecuadorian Andes is the last refuge for a tiny hummingbird facing extinction",
      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Deep in the Ecuadorian Andes, an ancient forest stands as a final sanctuary against the encroachment of human activity. This is the Yanacocha Reserve, the last refuge for the Black-breasted puffleg (Eriocnemis nigrivestis), a tiny hummingbird teetering on the edge of extinction.",
      "Measuring just 9 centimeters (3.5 inches), this emblematic bird of Quito is one of the most threatened species on the planet. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, its global population has dwindled to between 150 and 200 birds.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by the Jocotoco Foundation, the Yanacocha Reserve has become a centerpiece for Andean biodiversity.",
      "\u201cWe realized we were conserving an entire ecosystem, not just one species,\u201d conservationist Paola Villalba told The Associated Press.",
      "The bird is easily identified by the striking white \u201ctrousers\u201d of feathers around its legs, which contrast sharply with its deep, metallic black chest and bronze-green wings. Despite its beauty, its survival is at risk as high-altitude forests are cleared for grazing and agriculture.",
      "Shirley Farinango, of the Birds and Conservation Foundation, notes that the pressure is most intense because the puffleg occupies a narrow ecological niche between 3,000 and 3,500 meters (9,800 and 11,400 feet) above sea level. This specific elevation, she said, is \u201cprime territory\" to be converted to agricultural land.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the settlement in Ukraine with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoys during marathon overnight talks, and the Kremlin insisted that the territorial issue needs to be resolved to reach a peace deal.",
      "The Kremlin meeting, which lasted past 3 a.m. Friday, came hours after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sharply criticized his European allies Thursday for what he cast as their slow and fragmented response to Russia\u2019s nearly four-year full-scale invasion that he said has left Ukraine at the mercy of Putin amid an ongoing U.S. push for a peace settlement.",
      "Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov, who participated in Putin\u2019s meeting with Trump\u2019s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, said \"it was reaffirmed that reaching a long-term settlement can\u2019t be expected without solving the territorial issue,\u201d a reference to Moscow\u2019s demand that Kyiv withdraws its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but never fully captured.",

      "Ushakov noted that Trump\u2019s envoys informed Putin about Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelenskyy, as well as earlier discussions they had with Ukrainian and European officials. The Kremlin talks that he described as \u201cfrank, constructive\u201d and \u201cfruitful\u201d began when it was just before midnight in Moscow and lasted nearly four hours.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner were joined by Josh Gruenbaum, the head of the Federal Acquisition Service who serves as a senior adviser on Trump\u2019s Board of Peace that Russia has been invited to join. While Russia is considering the invitation, Putin reaffirmed his offer to send $1 billion to the board from Russian assets frozen in the U.S. to help fund rebuilding Gaza.",
      "Asked about Putin\u2019s proposal to use Russia\u2019s frozen assets for the contribution to the Board of Peace, Trump said he thought it was fine. \u201cIf he\u2019s using his money, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said",

      "He said the sticking points in talks remain the same as they\u2019ve been during talks held during the past six or seven months, noting \u201cboundaries\u201d was a key issue. \u201cThe main hold-up is the same things that\u2019s been holding it up for the last year,\u201d he said.",

But the battlefield gains along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line have been costly for Moscow, and the Russian economy is feeling the consequences of the war and international sanctions.",
      "Ukraine is short of money and, despite significantly boosting its own arms manufacturing, still needs Western weaponry. It is also short-handed on the front line. Its defense minister last week reported some 200,000 troop desertions, and draft-dodging by about 2 million Ukrainians.",

      "KYLEAKIN, Scotland -- Bally Philp hauls up his baited traps from the waters off Scotland\u2019s Isle of Skye, checking each one methodically. Unlike most of Scotland\u2019s coastline, these waters are protected from industrial fishing methods that have devastated seabeds elsewhere. But Philp, who\u2019s fished for more than three decades, has watched conditions deteriorate nearly everywhere else along the coast.",
      "\u201cThe inshore archipelagos on the West Coast of Scotland used to be full of fish,\u201d Philp said. \u201cWe have no commercial quantities of fish left inshore at all.\u201d",
      "While 37% of Scotland\u2019s waters have been designated as marine protected areas, only a small fraction have management measures in place to enforce that protection, according to environmental groups. Bottom trawling and scallop dredging \u2014 methods that rake the seabed \u2014 are permitted in about 95% of Scotland\u2019s coastal waters, including within designated protected areas, according to marine conservation groups.",
      "Bottom trawls drag heavy nets across the seafloor, crushing marine habitats. The method causes extensive carbon pollution: it burns nearly three times more fuel than other fishing methods, and the nets disturb seabed sediments, releasing stored carbon into the ocean. Bottom trawlers often discard a substantial portion of their catch back into the sea, and survival rates for discarded marine life are typically very low.",
      "The problem isn't just in Scotland. Across Europe and globally, bottom trawling within protected areas remains common and often unregulated, with industrial vessels operating in waters officially set aside for conservation. A 2024 report from the Marine Conservation Society and Oceana found 90% of protected marine sites across seven European countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Spain, experienced bottom trawling between 2015 and 2023, with vessels logging 4.4 million bottom trawling hours in protected waters.",
      "In 1984, a longstanding 3\u2011mile (4.8-kilometer) ban on bottom trawling around much of Scotland\u2019s coast was repealed. Fish landings in areas such as the Clyde plummeted, with catches of many species now only a tiny fraction of their historical levels.",
      "Philp began his fishing career working on trawlers in the late 1980s. By then, fish had become bycatch \u2014 unwanted species caught accidentally that were often illegal to land under newly introduced quota systems. His job was to shovel them overboard, dead.",
      "\u201cYou would see a stream of dead fish flowing off the back of the boat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a heartbreaking thing to see.\u201d",
      "He resolved instead to fish with baited traps \u2014 a method that causes minimal habitat damage and allows most unwanted catch to survive when returned to the sea.",
      "But that choice has meant limiting himself to the shrinking number of areas where such fishing remains viable. Across much of the U.K., reefs have been heavily damaged or destroyed by scallop dredging. Loch Alsh, where Philp works, holds some of the most intact reefs remaining.",
      "Philp, who comes from three generations of fishers, says he\u2019ll be the last in his family to make a living in this industry. He taught his two sons, now 20 and 30, how to fish, but he\u2019s discouraged them from making it a career.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the arse end of something that was once really good,\u201d Philp said. \u201cUnless we can turn that around, why would anyone want their kids to do this?\u201d",
      "Philp isn\u2019t alone in struggling to sustain traditional fishing practices. Scallop diver Alasdair Hughson spends four days a week at sea, traveling far from home in Dingwall and his two children, because nearby coastal areas have been too degraded to support his work, he said.",
      "\u201cIf there was no need to increase the size of vessels and move about and become more nomadic, we would have just stayed the way we were, because why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he said.",
      "By the time he started diving, stocks had declined. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t regenerating because scallop dredging had altered the habitat to such an extent.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Marine Conservation Society analysis found that banning bottom trawling in U.K. offshore protected areas could deliver a net benefit of up to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) over 20 years, accounting for increased carbon storage, pollution removal, nutrient cycling and recreation opportunities.",

      "The damage could affect Scotland\u2019s tourism industry, Turner said. Visitors to destinations like the Isle of Skye typically find fish and chips on menus that are imported. More than 80% of seafood eaten in the U.K. in 2019 was fished or farmed outside U.K. waters, according to the World Wildlife Fund.",
      "\u201cThere is a huge demand from tourists and it is difficult to meet these demands,\u201d said Miles Craven, executive chef at Wickman Hotels on the Isle of Skye. \u201cI have noticed it get incrementally harder in the last eight years.\u201d",
      "The Scottish government had indicated it would launch a consultation on fisheries management measures for coastal protected areas in late 2025, but in December officials announced the consultation would be delayed at least six months.",
      "Scientists and community groups are already in the field designing restoration approaches, including efforts to restore sea grass and oyster populations. But conservationists say this won\u2019t be sufficient without reinstating a coastal limit that protects at least 30% of Scotland\u2019s inshore seas \u2014 part of the international target to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson said 13% of inshore protected areas are currently closed to certain types of bottom trawling and scallop dredging, and additional measures are expected in the coming years that will allow Scotland to exceed the 30% protection by the 2030 target. Officials cited upcoming parliamentary elections and late delivery by external contractors for the consultation delay.",
      "\u201cThe more aware I become about the nuances of fisheries management and the marine ecosystems that we\u2019re working in, the more despair I feel because I know we can get it right,\u201d Philp said.",
      "For Philp and other small-scale fishermen, the timeline means more years of waiting for marine protected areas that were designated a decade ago and still lack enforcement.",
      "\u201cI know we can fix this,\" he said. \"I despair at the fact that we\u2019re being so slow to fix this.\u201d",

      "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The toll in Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has reached at least 5,002 people killed, activists said Friday, warning many more were feared dead as the most comprehensive internet blackout in the country's history crossed the two-week mark.",
      "The challenge in getting information out of Iran persists due to authorities cutting off access to the internet on Jan. 8, even as tensions rise between the United States and Iran as an American aircraft carrier group moves closer to the Middle East \u2014 a force U.S. President Donald Trump likened to an \u201carmada\u201d in comments to journalists late Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the death toll, saying 4,716 were demonstrators, 203 were government-affiliated, 43 were children and 40 were civilians not taking part in the protests. It added that more than 26,800 people had been detained in a widening arrest campaign by authorities.",
      "The group's figures have been accurate in previous unrest in Iran and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Iran\u2019s government offered its first death toll Wednesday, saying 3,117 people were killed. It added that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 were civilians and security forces, with the rest being \u201cterrorists.\u201d Iran\u2019s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, in part due to authorities cutting access to the internet and blocking international calls into the country.

      "Venezuela\u2019s legislature is debating a major overhaul of its oil sector, the first since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's era",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s legislature advanced a bill on Thursday to loosen state control over the country's vast oil sector in the first major overhaul since the late socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized parts of the industry in 2007.",
      "The legislation would formally break decades of state command over some of the world's largest oil reserves, create new opportunities for private companies to invest and establish international arbitration for investment disputes.",
      "Following the U.S. capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, the Trump administration has ramped up pressure on acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and other allies of the ousted leader to invite greater investment from U.S. energy companies in Venezuela\u2019s flagging oil industry.",
      "A draft of the proposed legislation, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, represents a stark retreat from the resource nationalism at the heart of Venezuela's socialist-inspired revolution.",
      "Reflecting U.S. demands, the proposed legislation would allow private companies to independently operate oil fields, market their own crude output and collect the cash revenues through contracts with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company and long the cornerstone of Venezuela\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cThe operating company shall assume the comprehensive management of the execution of the activities, at its sole cost, expense and risk,\u201d the draft says, adding that portions of production volumes \u201cmay be directly commercialized by the operating company, once governmental obligations have been fulfilled.\u201d",
      "Crucially, the bill offers companies the option of settling legal disputes through arbitration in international courts rather than just local courts. It also allows the government to cut royalties from the current 30% to as low as 15% and slash extraction taxes to persuade companies to commit to difficult projects in underdeveloped fields.",
      "The president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, told lawmakers at the start of Thursday\u2019s debate that the bill aims to \u201callow an accelerated increase in production\u201d of oil in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cOil under the ground is useless,\u201d he said, referring to the need to boost oil production and open up exploration opportunities.",
      "Pushed by Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the bill is expected to advance swiftly through the ruling party-dominated legislature.",
      "After around two hours of discussion, lawmakers gave initial approval to the bill on Thursday and sent it to a second round of debate, yet to be scheduled.",
      "During the session, Orlando Camacho, a lawmaker and head of Venezuela\u2019s national Fedeindustria business association, said the bill ensures \u201cthat oil continues to be the driving force of our country\u2019s development.\u201d",

      "He said that some 200,000 families across Puerto Rico rely on solar power that generates close to 1.4 gigawatts of energy a day for the rest of the island.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s helping avoid blackouts,\u201d he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.",
      "He said he was saddened by the cancellation of the solar projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are funds for the most needy.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.",
      "In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.",
      "One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.",
      "\u201cThe people are really upset and angry,\u201d said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they\u2019re not sure why they\u2019re not included.\u201d",

Under his leadership, the government has cut tens of thousands of public-sector jobs, redrawn administrative boundaries to speed decision-making, and initiated dozens of major infrastructure projects.",
      "Lam spent decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming its minister in 2016. He led an anti-corruption campaign championed by his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. During his rise, Vietnam\u2019s Politburo lost six of its 18 members during an anti-graft campaign, including two former presidents and Vietnam\u2019s parliamentary head.",

      "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The toll in Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has reached at least 5,002 people killed, activists said Friday, warning many more were feared dead as the most comprehensive internet blackout in the country's history crossed the two-week mark.",
      "The challenge in getting information out of Iran persists due to authorities cutting off access to the internet on Jan. 8, even as tensions rise between the United States and Iran as an American aircraft carrier group moves closer to the Middle East \u2014 a force U.S. President Donald Trump likened to an \u201carmada\u201d in comments to journalists late Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the death toll, saying 4,716 were demonstrators, 203 were government-affiliated, 43 were children and 40 were civilians not taking part in the protests. It added that more than 26,800 people had been detained in a widening arrest campaign by authorities.",
      "The group's figures have been accurate in previous unrest in Iran and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Iran\u2019s government offered its first death toll Wednesday, saying 3,117 people were killed. It added that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 were civilians and security forces, with the rest being \u201cterrorists.\u201d Iran\u2019s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, in part due to authorities cutting access to the internet and blocking international calls into the country. Iran also reportedly has limited journalists\u2019 ability locally to report on the aftermath, instead repeatedly airing claims on state television that refer to demonstrators as \u201crioters\u201d motivated by America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the allegation.",
      "The new toll comes as tensions remain high over Trump laying down two red lines over the protests \u2014 the killing of peaceful demonstrators and Tehran conducting mass executions. Iran\u2019s attorney general and others have called some of those being held \u201cmohareb\u201d \u2014 or \u201cenemies of God.\u201d That charge carries the death penalty. It had been used along with others to carry out mass executions in 1988 that reportedly killed at least 5,000 people.",

      "The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.",
      "The court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "Last year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors.",
      "\u201cWe disagree,\u201d the court said then. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\u201d",
      "That is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.",
      "Allowing Cook\u2019s firing to go forward \u201cwould weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\u201d said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "But the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?",
      "Several legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,\u201d said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. \u201cThe whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven\u2019t explained exactly why.\u201d",
      "Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, \u201cI\u2019ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.\u201d",
      "Just last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the \u201cunitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.",
      "Agency directors, like Slaughter, \u201care exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries\u201d without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.",
      "With the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply \u2014 historically hasn\u2019t been overseen by the executive branch.",

      "Some legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, \u201cWhereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"",
      "The First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both \u201cconducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.",
      "But Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.",
      "There are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.",
      "\u201cThere is no fourth type of government power,\u201d Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.\u201d",
      "Still, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.",
      "And even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook \u201cfor cause,\u201d while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.",
      "\u201cThere is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t dispute that that\u2019s what Congress was doing.\u201d",
      "Paul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, \u201cit\u2019s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it\u2019s not that different. This is just like the FTC.\u201d",
      "Instead, Clement added, \u201cthey come in and say, no, we\u2019re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.",
      "For now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there\u2019s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,\u201d Clement said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.\u201d",

      "An appeal for bankruptcy protection filing of the operator of Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus has left the luxury department stores\u2019 suppliers with unpaid bills and caused a rift with Amazon, one of Saks Global\u2019s minority investors",
      "NEW YORK -- An appeal for bankruptcy protection filing of the operator of Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus has left the luxury department stores' suppliers with unpaid bills and caused a rift with Amazon, one of Saks Global's minority investors.",
      "Saks Global said last week it had secured roughly $1.75 billion to help finance the company toward hoped-for profitability. The company said it would honor all customer loyalty programs, compensate vendors and pay employees while seeking approval for its plan to pay off outstanding liabilities, which range from $1 billion to $10 billion, according to court documents.",
      "While the retailer's stores remain open for now, the bankruptcy and restructuring could likely impact the assortment of designer brands customers find online or in their local Neiman Marcus or Saks, according to industry experts.",
      "Many brands stopped shipping their goods weeks ago as Saks Global's financial distress became more evident and bankruptcy appeared inevitable, experts said. A visit to Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan last week revealed noticeable merchandise gaps, including handbags and shoes spread out along shelves.",
      "Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail, a research firm, noted it's critical for Saks to have a good assortment including trendy items from small niche brands.",
      "\u201cIf Saks or Neiman Marcus are not offering that, those customers will find somewhere else to shop,\" he said.",
      "The bankruptcy occurred a little over a year after the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue agreed to buy the Neiman Marcus Group, its upscale rival, for $2.65 billion. Amazon took a minority stake in the deal, which saddled the new holding company with significant debt at a time of rising competition and a slowdown in luxury spending.",
      "Here's a look at some ripple effects from the bankruptcy filing, including the retailers who potentially could stand to benefit:",
      "Major brands like Chanel and Kering \u2014 the parent of Gucci and Saint Laurent, among others\u2014 top the list of creditors owed the most money. But bankruptcy lawyers and industry executives expect that luxury conglomerates will be fine.",
      "The big worry: the small and medium-size brands that have already been squeezed financially by Saks. Some could shutter their businesses if bills are left unpaid.",
      "\u201cThis is very painful,\" said Joseph Sarachek, a lawyer who represents roughly 30 brands owed money by Saks. \u201dA lot of these guys are going to go out of business.\u201d",
      "Sarachek declined to name his clients for fear of retribution by Saks but said that they're owed anywhere from $600,000 to $10 million. He said his clients don't operate their own stores, and for some, Saks had been their only big retail account.",
      "He said he has recommended to his clients not to ship to Saks unless they get more clarity on payment terms.",
      "Even before the merger with Neiman Marcus, suppliers were grappling with skipped payments from Saks, creating anger and mistrust.",
      "Over the past year, that relationship only worsened, with management changing the payment terms for brands that supplied the stores, according to Gary Wassner, CEO of Hildun Corp. which provides credit guarantees to roughly 120 brands that sell to Saks.",
      "For some, Saks Global accounted for 40% to 50% of their business, he said.",
      "Wassner advised his clients not to ship to Saks starting in Dec. 19. He said Wednesday he's hoping to approve shipping next week once agreeable payment terms are negotiated.",

      "But shoppers can expect more store closures.",

      "David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital, a cryptocurrency hedge fund and a former bankruptcy lawyer and distressed investor, believes the most vulnerable will be Saks Off 5th locations, which haven't fared well and have faced stiff competition from the likes of T.J. Maxx.",
      "Among rivals that could benefit are luxury department store chains Nordstrom and Macy\u2019s upscale sister Bloomingdale\u2019s, according to Tawil and Saunders. Other beneficiaries could be luxury brands\u2019 own stores as well as online luxury players like the RealReal, which sells gently used luxury items, the experts said.",
      "Shoppers are seeing generous discounts at Saks, Neiman Marcus and Saks Off 5th.",
      "Saks' website shows up to 70% on select designer clothing, while Neiman Marcus is marking down select styles at up to 75% off, according to its website. Saks Off 5th website is promoting up to 85% off items.",
      "Saunders noted the retailer is hoping to generate buzz and sales, but once the court approves a plan for store closures and vendor payments, it will likely scale back the discounts \u2014 unless that particular store liquidates.",
      "Still, don't expect to grab a Chanel or Louis Vuitton handbag at 75%, Tawil said. Many of the major iconic brands have clauses triggered by a bankruptcy filing that limit discounts.",

    "story": [
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislature is debating a major overhaul of its oil sector, the first since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's era",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s legislature advanced a bill on Thursday to loosen state control over the country's vast oil sector in the first major overhaul since the late socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized parts of the industry in 2007.",
      "The legislation would formally break decades of state command over some of the world's largest oil reserves, create new opportunities for private companies to invest and establish international arbitration for investment disputes.",
      "Following the U.S. capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, the Trump administration has ramped up pressure on acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and other allies of the ousted leader to invite greater investment from U.S. energy companies in Venezuela\u2019s flagging oil industry.",
      "A draft of the proposed legislation, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, represents a stark retreat from the resource nationalism at the heart of Venezuela's socialist-inspired revolution.",
      "Reflecting U.S. demands, the proposed legislation would allow private companies to independently operate oil fields, market their own crude output and collect the cash revenues through contracts with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company and long the cornerstone of Venezuela\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cThe operating company shall assume the comprehensive management of the execution of the activities, at its sole cost, expense and risk,\u201d the draft says, adding that portions of production volumes \u201cmay be directly commercialized by the operating company, once governmental obligations have been fulfilled.\u201d",
      "Crucially, the bill offers companies the option of settling legal disputes through arbitration in international courts rather than just local courts. It also allows the government to cut royalties from the current 30% to as low as 15% and slash extraction taxes to persuade companies to commit to difficult projects in underdeveloped fields.",
      "The president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, told lawmakers at the start of Thursday\u2019s debate that the bill aims to \u201callow an accelerated increase in production\u201d of oil in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cOil under the ground is useless,\u201d he said, referring to the need to boost oil production and open up exploration opportunities.",
      "Pushed by Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the bill is expected to advance swiftly through the ruling party-dominated legislature.",
      "After around two hours of discussion, lawmakers gave initial approval to the bill on Thursday and sent it to a second round of debate, yet to be scheduled.",
      "During the session, Orlando Camacho, a lawmaker and head of Venezuela\u2019s national Fedeindustria business association, said the bill ensures \u201cthat oil continues to be the driving force of our country\u2019s development.\u201d",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 Colombia announced Thursday that it will apply a 30% tax on a group of products from Ecuador and will suspend the sale of energy to that country, in response to a matching tariff announced the previous day by the government of Ecuadorian Daniel Noboa.",
      "The escalating trade dispute between the South American neighbors follows a public protest by Noboa regarding a more than $850 million trade deficit with Colombia. Noboa also cited a lack of reciprocity in securing their shared border, which remains a stronghold for criminal organizations and international drug trafficking.",
      "The Colombian government expressed surprise at Ecuador\u2019s unilateral tariffs, noting that bilateral cooperation remains active through established binational mechanisms, including joint military and anti-narcotics operations.",
      "From January to November 2024, Ecuadorian exports to Colombia totaled $760 million against $1.8 billion in imports, according to Ecuador's ministry of production. Building on this trend, the Ecuadorian Federation of Exporters reported that the trade deficit with Colombia reached $852 million during the same period in 2025.",
      "The 30% tariff announced Thursday by Colombia covers 20 unspecified Ecuadorian products, with authorities noting \u201cthe possibility of extending the measure to a broader group.\u201d",
      "Colombia's ministry of commerce said that these specific exports represent approximately $250 million, highlighting the significant impact on bilateral trade conditions. However, Commerce Minister Diana Marcela Morales noted that the tariffs are temporary and remains open to a diplomatic, negotiated solution.",
      "Business leaders in Colombia and Ecuador are warning of immediate economic fallout if their governments fail to resolve the current tariff dispute.",
      "\u201cSince yesterday, member companies have been contacting us in a state of high concern,\u201d Oliva Diazgranados, executive director of the Bogot\u00e1-based Colombian-Ecuadorian Chamber of Commerce, told The Associated Press. \u201cThis situation directly impacts corporate development and sales projections; it may even threaten jobs.\u201d",

      "Palma highlighted the irony of the current friction, noting that during Ecuador\u2019s severe energy crisis in late 2024, Colombia consistently provided roughly 90% of its exportable power \u2014 totaling approximately 450 megawatts \u2014 to stabilize its neighbor\u2019s grid.",

      "Consumer spending climbed 0.5% in November from the previous month, the report also showed, a solid increase that hits at an economy growing at a healthy pace in the final three months of last year.",
      "The figures point to a mostly strong economy with inflation still elevated, but down sharply from a four-decade peak in June 2022. Hiring has slowed to a crawl, however, leaving job-seekers frustrated even as the unemployment rate stays low. Thursday's figures suggest that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to reduce its key interest rate when it meets next week, a tact typically used if it is worried about a stumbling economy.",

      "NEW YORK -- Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.",
      "Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash \u2014 a price that remains unchanged, giving it a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner\u2019s merger agreement with Netflix last month.",
      "As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner \u2014 which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.",
      "In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount has also promised a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner\u2019s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.",
      "Warner\u2019s board has repeatedly backed the deal it struck with Netflix, which in December agreed to buy the company\u2019s studio and streaming business for $72 billion \u2014 now in an all-cash transaction that it says will simplify the transaction and speed up the path to a shareholder vote. Including debt, the enterprise value of that deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.",
      "But Paramount has continued to argue that its offer is superior. On Thursday, the company accused Warner's board of \u201crushing to solicit shareholder approval\u201d for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from Warner's previously-announced spinoff of its networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.",

But Paramount\u2019s bid is for the entire company \u2014 which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.",

      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "Sand that runs off into freshwater bodies \u2014 lakes, streams and rivers \u2014 can kill natural growth, Tirado said.",
      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can\u2019t wait ... you need to go out multiple times. That way it keeps the paved surface more clear in a productive and proactive manner.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,\" said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. \u201cWe also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.\"",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s helping avoid blackouts,\u201d he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.",

      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.",
      "In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.",
      "One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.",
      "\u201cThe people are really upset and angry,\u201d said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they\u2019re not sure why they\u2019re not included.\u201d",

      "Greenland's strategic location makes it a focal point if there were to be a nuclear conflict involving Russia, China and the United States",
      "PARIS -- In a hypothetical nuclear war involving Russia, China and the United States, the island of Greenland would be in the middle of Armageddon.",
      "The strategic importance of the Arctic territory \u2014 under the flight paths that nuclear-armed missiles from China and Russia could take on their way to incinerating targets in the United States, and vice versa \u2014 is one of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has cited in his disruptive campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, alarming Greenlanders and longtime allies in Europe alike.",
      "Trump has argued that U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for his \u201cGolden Dome\u201d \u2014 a multibillion dollar missile defense system that he says will be operational before his term ends in 2029.",
      "\u201cBecause of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Saturday.",
      "That ushered in another roller-coaster week involving the semiautonomous Danish territory, where Trump again pushed for U.S. ownership before seemingly backing off, announcing Wednesday the \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d on Arctic security that's unlikely to be the final word.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Greenland's position at a crossroads for nuclear defense.",
      "Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, that nuclear adversaries would fire at each other \u2014 if it ever came to that \u2014 tend to take the shortest direct route, on a ballistic trajectory into space and down again, from their silos or launchers to targets. The shortest flight paths from China or Russia to the United States \u2014 and the other way \u2014 would take many of them over the Arctic region.",
      "Russian Topol-M missiles fired, for example, from the Tatishchevo silo complex southeast of Moscow would fly high over Greenland, if targeted at the U.S. ICBM force of 400 Minuteman III missiles, housed at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming.",
      "Chinese Dong Feng-31 missiles, if fired from new silo fields that the U.S. Defense Department says have been built in China, also could overfly Greenland should they be targeted at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.",
      "\u201cIf there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center,\u201d Trump said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "An array of farseeing early warning radars act as the Pentagon's eyes against any missile attack. The northernmost of them is in Greenland, at the Pituffik Space Base. Pronounced \u201cbee-doo-FEEK,\u201d it used to be called Thule Air Base, but was renamed in 2023 using the remote location's Greenlandic name, recognizing the Indigenous community that was forcibly displaced by the U.S. outpost's construction in 1951.",
      "Its location above the Arctic Circle, and roughly halfway between Washington and Moscow, enables it to peer with its radar over the Arctic region, into Russia and at potential flight paths of U.S.-targeted Chinese missiles.",
      "\u201cThat gives the United States more time to think about what to do,\u201d said Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based analyst who specializes in Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cGreenland is a good location for that.\u201d",
      "The two-sided, solid-state AN/FPS-132 radar is designed to quickly detect and track ballistic missile launches, including from submarines, to help inform the U.S. commander in chief's response and provide data for interceptors to try and destroy warheads.",

      "Pitching the \u201cGolden Dome\u201d in Davos, Trump said that the U.S. needs ownership of Greenland to defend it.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t defend it on a lease,\u201d he said.",
      "But defense specialists struggle to comprehend that logic given that the U.S. has operated at Pituffik for decades without owning Greenland.",
      "French nuclear defense specialist Etienne Marcuz points out that Trump has never spoken of also needing to take control of the United Kingdom \u2014 even though it, like Greenland, also plays an important role in U.S. missile defense.",
      "An early warning radar operated by the U.K.'s Royal Air Force at Fylingdales, in northern England, serves both the U.K. and U.S governments, scanning for missiles from Russia and elsewhere and northward to the polar region. The unit's motto is \u201cVigilamus\" \u2014 Latin for \u201cWe are watching.\u201d",
      "Trump's envisioned multilayered \u201cGolden Dome\u201d could include space-based sensors to detect missiles. They could reduce the U.S. need for its Greenland-based radar station, said Marcuz, a former nuclear defense worker for France\u2019s Defense Ministry, now with the Foundation for Strategic Research think tank in Paris.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s argument that Greenland is vital for the Golden Dome \u2014 and therefore that it has to be invaded, well, acquired \u2014 is false for several reasons,\" Marcuz said.",
      "\u201cOne of them is that there is, for example, a radar in the United Kingdom, and to my knowledge there is no question of invading the U.K. And, above all, there are new sensors that are already being tested, in the process of being deployed, which will in fact reduce Greenland\u2019s importance.\u201d",
      "Because of its location, Greenland could be a useful place to station \u201cGolden Dome\u201d interceptors to try to destroy warheads before they reach the continental U.S.",
      "The \u201chighly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency ... if this Land is included in it,\" Trump wrote in his post last weekend.",
      "But the U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement. Before Trump ratcheted up the heat on the territory and Denmark, its owner, their governments likely would have readily accepted any American military request for an expanded footprint there, experts say. It used to have multiple bases and installations, but later abandoned them, leaving just Pituffik.",
      "\u201cDenmark was the most compliant ally of the United States,\u201d Marcuz said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s very different. I don\u2019t know whether authorization would be granted, but in any case, before, the answer was \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d",

On Saturday morning, he will climb it in his signature free solo style \u2014 without ropes or protective equipment. And Netflix will broadcast it \u2014 live.",
      "The event\u2019s announcement has drawn both excitement and trepidation, as well as some concerns over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast. Many have questioned Honnold\u2019s desire to continues his free-solo climbs now that he\u2019s a married father of two young girls.",
      "Known for his legendary ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, documented in \u201cFree Solo,\u201d Honnold is intent on pushing the limits of climbing around the world.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at climbing objectives, you look for things that are singular,\u201d Honnold told The Associated Press late last year. \u201cSomething like El Capitan where it\u2019s way bigger and way prouder than all the things around it.\u201d",
      "Something like Taipei 101.",
      "Honnold won\u2019t be the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he will be the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004, as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building. He took nearly four hours to finish, almost twice as long as what he anticipated, all while nursing an injured elbow and battered by wind and rain.",
      "Honnold, who has been training for months, doesn't think his climb will be hard. He\u2019s practiced the moves on the building and spoke with Robert on his climbing podcast.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that extreme,\u201d Honnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s the perfect sweet spot where it\u2019s hard enough to be engaging for me and obviously an interesting climb.\u201d",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment will have eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by a balcony that Honnold would be able to rest on.",
      "The \u201cSkyscraper Live\u201d broadcast will be on a 10-second delay and begin Friday evening for viewers in the U.S.",
      "James Smith, an executive with event producer Plimsoll Productions, said he consulted safety advisers almost immediately after he first spoke with Honnold about attempting the climb. Smith works with a risk management group for film and TV called Secret Compass, which has supported productions in filming penguins in Antarctica and helping Chris Hemsworth walk across a crane projecting from an Australian skyscraper's roof, alike.",
      "Smith and Honnold will be able to communicate throughout the event. They\u2019ll have cameramen positioned inside the building, various hatches and places to bail during the climb and four high-angle camera operators suspended on ropes.",
      "\u201cThese people all know Alex. They trust Alex. They\u2019re going to be close to him throughout the whole climb,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get us kind of amazing shots, but they\u2019re also there just to keep an eye on him, and if there\u2019s any problems, they can kind of help.\u201d",
      "The production has also commissioned professional weather forecasters to provide updates leading up to climb day. There's currently a small chance of light rain in the morning, Smith said. Ultimately, if conditions are bad, Honnold won\u2019t climb.",
      "At his local gym, Taiwanese rock climber Chin Tzu-hsiang said he\u2019s grown up always looking up at the Taipei 101 and wondering if he could climb it. Honnold is a household name among rock climbers even in Taiwan, and Chin said he has students who have only been climbing for a year or two who are excited to watch. Based on watching Honnold in his other climbs, Chin said he trusts him to prepare for the challenge and not to recklessly take risks.",

      "The tan-colored prints analyzed by Indonesian and Australian researchers on the island of Sulawesi were made by blowing pigment over hands placed against the cave walls, leaving an outline. Some of the fingertips were also tweaked to look more pointed.",
      "This prehistoric art form suggests the Indonesian island was home to a flourishing artistic culture. To figure out how old the paintings were, researchers dated mineral crusts that had formed on top of the art.",
      "Upon seeing the new study, independent paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger said she \u201clet out a little squeal of joy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt fits everything I'd been thinking,\u201d she said.",
      "Indonesia is known to host some of the world\u2019s earliest cave drawings, and scientists have analyzed countless examples of ancient art across the globe \u2014 including simple marks on bones and stones that go back hundreds of thousands of years. Cross-hatched markings on a piece of rock in South Africa have been dated to about 73,000 years ago.",
      "The new art from southeastern Sulawesi is the oldest to be found on cave walls. The stencils also represent a more complex tradition of rock art that could have been a shared cultural practice, said study author Maxime Aubert with Griffith University, who published the study Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Scientists are eager to understand when early humans learned to make art, moving from dots and lines to more meaningful representations of themselves and the world around them. These cave drawings help firm up a timeline for the dawn of human creativity.",

      "Meteorologists warn that a stretched polar vortex could bring severe winter weather to much of the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Warm Arctic waters and cold continental land are combining to stretch the dreaded polar vortex in a way that will send much of the United States a devastating dose of winter later this week with swaths of painful subzero temperatures, heavy snow and powerline-toppling ice.",
      "Meteorologists said the eastern two-thirds of the nation is threatened with a winter storm that could rival the damage of a major hurricane and has some origins in an Arctic that is warming from climate change. They warn that the frigid weather is likely to stick around through the rest of January and into early February, meaning the snow and ice that accumulates will take a long time to melt.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s forecast has the storm stretching from New Mexico to New England, threatening at least 250 million people.",
      "\u201cI think people are underestimating just how bad it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Ryan Maue, now a private meteorologist.",
      "The polar vortex, a patch of bitter cold air that often stays penned up in northern Canada and Alaska, is being elongated by a wave in the upper atmosphere that goes back to a relatively ice-free part of the Arctic and snow-buried Siberia. As the bone-chilling temperatures sweep through the U.S., they'll meet with moisture from off California and the Gulf of Mexico to set up crippling ice and snow in many areas.",
      "The origins of the system begin in the Arctic, where relatively warmer temperatures add energy to the polar vortex and help push its cold air south.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is aligned perfectly that the pattern is locked into this warm Arctic, cold continent,\" Maue said. \"And it\u2019s not just here for us in North America, but the landmass of Eastern Europe to Siberia is also exceptionally cold. The whole hemisphere has gone into the deep freeze.\u201d",
      "As far back as October 2025, changes in the Arctic and low sea ice were setting up conditions for the kind of stretched polar vortex that brings severe winter weather to the U.S., said winter weather expert Judah Cohen, an MIT research scientist. Heavy Siberian snowfall added to the push-and-pull of weather that warps the shape of the normally mostly circular air pattern. Those conditions \u201ckind of loaded the dice a bit'' for a stretching of the polar vortex, he said.",
      "Cohen co-authored a July 2025 study that found more stretched polar vortex events linked to severe winter weather bursts in the central and eastern U.S. over the past decade. Cohen said part of the reason is that dramatically low sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic helps set up a pattern of waves that end up causing U.S. cold bursts. A warmer Arctic is causing sea ice in that region to shrink faster than other places, studies have found.",
      "Arctic sea ice is at a record low extent for this time of year, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "The center of the stretched polar vortex will be somewhere above Duluth, Minnesota, by Friday morning, ushering in \u201clong-lasting brutal cold,\u201d Maue said. Temperatures in the North and Midwest will get about as cold as possible, even down to minus 25 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 32 to minus 34 degrees Celsius), Maue said. The average low temperature for the Lower 48 states will dance around 11 or 12 degrees (minus 12 to minus 11 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Maue said.",

Treacherous freezing rain could stretch from the southern plains through the mid-South and into the Carolinas, he said.",

      "With temperatures in the breeding ground increasing 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) from 2012 to 2022, three different penguin species are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study in Tuesday's Journal of Animal Ecology. And that sets up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "\u201cPenguins are changing the time at which they\u2019re breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\u201d said lead author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.''",

The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

    "summary": "Former Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told ABC News that Europe must meet U.S. threats over Greenland with strength.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. president is waging a pressure campaign to acquire the Arctic island.",
      "LONDON -- Denmark's new government was less than two months old when U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to acquire Greenland broke into public view in the summer of 2019.",
      "\"We thought it was unprecedented,\" recalled former Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod, who then was in post and suddenly tasked with a transcontinental fire drill.",
      "Trump's desire for what he at the time called \"essentially a large real estate deal\" threw a wrench in the works of a planned state visit by the president to Denmark. The president ultimately cancelled the trip, saying Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had shown \"no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland.\"",
      "Frederiksen at the time rejected Trump's proposal as \"absurd.\"",
      "Kofod, who has since left Danish politics, told ABC News in an interview on Tuesday that the 2019 saga was \"a really bad situation for the bilateral relationship.\"",
      "\"We also saw it as offending a close ally,\" Kofod recalled. \"We were very surprised that the first major comments he had were, 'Why can't I just buy Greenland?'\"",
      "Copenhagen, he said, never considered formulating a price for Greenland's potential sale.",
      "At the time, though, Danish leaders did not believe Trump was \"determined\" to force a U.S. acquisition of the world's largest island, Kofod said. Rather, the Danish government saw the proposal as a means to foster more U.S. engagement in and influence over Greenland.",
      "Nearly seven years later, Kofod's successors -- again under the leadership of Frederiksen -- have faced a more protracted and aggressive campaign from Washington. Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. will acquire Greenland -- \"one way or another,\" he said earlier this month.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. Trump's second term has seen the president double down on his ambition to acquire the minerals-rich island -- despite Danish and Greenlandic politicians repeatedly rebuffing him.",
      "Trump has suggested that U.S. sovereignty over Greenland is necessary to ensure American security and blunt Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic region. A 1951 defense agreement already grants the U.S. military access to Greenland, but Trump has suggested the accord is inadequate and has demanded \"ownership.\"",
      "The issue dominated this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Trump said in a Wednesday address that he would not use military force to seize control of the Arctic landmass.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said during the event that a \"framework\" of a deal had been reached on Greenland after talks with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Details of the purported agreement are yet to be revealed.",
      "Frederikson said in a Thursday morning statement that Copenhagen \"cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a Thursday press conference that Nuuk is \"willing to do more in a NATO frame,\" but also said they have some \"red lines\" including territorial integrity, international law and sovereignty.",
      "In Davos on Wednesday, Trump said that Greenland's mineral deposits are \"not the reason we need it,\" though also said the professed deal \"puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals.\"",
      "Trump's professed security concerns have prompted Danish efforts to increase military spending in the Arctic and the deployment of small contingents of NATO troops to Greenland.",
      "But the deployments -- which the eight European nations involved said were for military exercises to enhance the defense of the region -- prompted Trump at the time to threaten new tariffs against the American allies starting on Feb. 1 unless the U.S. was able to acquire Greenland.",
      "That raised the prospect of a new transatlantic trade war, though Trump said Wednesday that he would drop the tariffs citing the purported deal.",
      "European and allied leaders have said they are open to deeper and broader cooperation with the U.S. in Greenland, to address American security concerns and to develop shared commercial opportunities across the mammoth, resources-rich territory.",
      "For Kofod -- who said his time in office saw Copenhagen and Washington forge a \"path forward\" despite tensions over Greenland -- any deal should be twinned with a European show of force.",
      "\"The first step is power,\" Kofod said. Trump may soften his attacks \"if he sees that he will have all of Europe -- including the U.K., France, Germany -- against him, and they are ready to defend Greenland,\" Kofod said, plus if he sees that European \"retaliation is so massive that it will hurt the U.S. economy and interests.\"",

      "The Danish and Greenlandic experience in 2019 bears striking similarities to 2026. Then, as now, Trump set off a diplomatic storm by repeatedly declaring his ambitions to take control of Greenland.",
      "In both instances, Copenhagen and the Greenlandic government in its capital Nuuk responded by expressing openness to further collaboration, stressing the importance of sovereignty and dispatching a high-level delegation for talks in Washington.",
      "Kofod said the de-escalation of tensions in 2019 was achieved through closer cooperation and modernization in the security sphere. \"We took the security concerns of Trump very seriously,\" he said.",
      "The period spanning Trump's first term and that of his successor, President Joe Biden, saw the U.S. reopen its consulate in Nuuk, modernize the Thule Air Base -- since renamed to the Pituffik Space Base -- and agree a new economic cooperation strategy in Greenland.",
      "Copenhagen and Nuuk, Kofod said, encouraged \"constructive engagement\" with the U.S. in investment, education programs, tourism and other areas.",
      "Similar measures might help ease the current round of pressure in the High North, Kofod said.",
      "But he added that the future of the Arctic -- which was long considered an area of scientific work largely free of geopolitical tensions -- will be inextricably tied to security considerations.",
      "Climate change, the subsequent melting of pack ice and the opening of new sea lanes is making the Arctic more navigable and -- potentially -- more lucrative. Russia's 15,000 miles of Arctic coastline puts Moscow at the forefront in the region, while China's declaration of itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" indicates Beijing's long-term interest there.",
      "\"That's why Trump is right on the concern about security in the future of the Arctic,\" Kofod said. \"Any U.S. president will find Greenland key to defending North America and the United States.\"",
      "Trump's efforts \"fit his ideology,\" Kofod said, saying his bid to acquire Greenland despite broad opposition aligns with the \"Donroe Doctrine\" -- a play on the 1823 Monroe Doctrine by which the U.S. said it would block European interference in the Western Hemisphere -- which has in recent weeks been professed by members of Trump's administration and noted by the president himself.",
      "\"There is something to that, that I think Europe hasn't taken seriously enough,\" Kofod said. \"But now they are taking it seriously.\"",
      "The turbulence will undermine European, American and collective NATO security, Kofod warned.",
      "\"For the U.S. it's also a big self-inflicted problem,\" he said. \"But I don't think Trump looks at the world like that. He\u00a0 thinks that NATO is there, it's important, but it's not something you cannot live without, because you just can form another alliance.\"",

      "The officer stood by his actions and says he was scapegoated by prosecutors.",
      "Former Uvalde school police officer Adrian Gonzales says he has no regrets about his actions nearly four years ago when he was the first officer to respond to the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School.",
      "In his first interview since being acquitted Wednesday night all counts, Gonzales said he stood by his actions and argued he was scapegoated by prosecutors looking for someone to blame.",
      "\"You can sit here and tell me all you want about what I would have done, or what you would have done. Until you're in that mix, you can't tell me anything,\" Gonzales told ABC News' John Qui\u00f1ones.",
      "The police response to the mass shooting has been the subject of intense criticism in the years since 19 students and two teachers were killed at the school.",
      "Nearly 400 law enforcement officers responded that day, but it took 77 minutes for officers to mount a counterassault. Gonzales was charged with 29 counts of child endangerment -- one of two officers to face criminal charges for his role in the police response.\u00a0 After a two-week trial, a jury acquitted Gonzales on all counts after seven hours of deliberations, prompting frustration from some of the families of victims who attended the trial.",
      "\"We had a little hope, but it wasn't enough,\" said Jacinto Cazares, whose 9-year-old daughter Jackie died in the shooting. \"Again, we are failed. I don't even know what to say.\"",
      "Gonzales said he was grateful to the jury for the verdict but said he understands that the families were frustrated with the outcome.",
      "\"Whatever I say to them, I know it's not going to ease their pain, but ... they're always in my prayers, you know, so they can start healing,\" he said.",
      "Speaking with ABC News, Gonzales walked through his actions the day of the shooting and said he did all he could to stop the violence. After arriving at the school in the late morning of the last day of school, Gonzales said he did not see the shooter but was one of the first officers to try to enter Robb Elementary. Gonzales said he only retreated from inside the school building because he received a direct order from his commanding officer.",
      "\"I did the best that I could with the information I was getting,\" he said, adding, \"I don't regret it, because I took an order from my chief at that time.\"",
      "Gonzales, 52, first began working as a school police officer after a decade with the Uvalde Police Department. He previously spent 18 years as a teacher, coached a local soccer team in Uvalde, and refereed youth sports games. Since his indictment, Gonzales said he feels like a pariah in Uvalde and said he had to relocate with his family.",
      "\"Working with kids was a passion for me,\" he said. \"When I got the opportunity to come back to the school as an officer, I took it and, unfortunately, it's not the same.\"",
      "Gonzales said he believes all of his actions that day were justified and that he was selectively prosecuted.",

      "\"He was the lowest man on the totem pole. He was the first on the scene,\" LaHood said. \"When you really look at the situation in the totality of the circumstances, you see that Adrian went to the danger initially, and then further went to the danger when he was one of the first five officers that went to that building.\"",
      "Another Gonzales attorney, Jason Goss, argued that prosecutors did the victims of the shooting a disservice by charging Gonzales, providing them false hope that his conviction might deliver accountability.",
      "\"The injustice was in starting by telling the family that Adrian was responsible because he was not,\" he said. \"The jury has determined that he was not, and they came to the correct verdict, but of course, the family doesn't feel correct, but that's because they were told something different.\"",
      "Gonzales said he fears his trial and the desire to hold individual cops accountable might have pulled focus away from issues that might make a difference in the future, like better training, response protocols or funding for school police officers.",

    "story": [
      "It has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the U.S. to not open the door for federal immigration agents unless they show a warrant signed by a judge",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.",
      "\u201cThere are rules and I know them,\u201d said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.",
      "Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government\u2019s forced entry into someone\u2019s home.",
      "As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.",
      "But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people\u2019s homes without a judge\u2019s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.",
      "The shift comes as President Donald Trump's administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.",
      "Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.",
      "\u201cBut if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent \u2014 they are not paying the rent \u2014 that's the last straw,\u201d he said.",
      "Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.",
      "It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,\u201d Blumenthal said in a news release.",
      "Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the \u201cphysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u201d",
      "For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.",
      "In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn\u2019t leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.",
      "ICE has tried what the agency called \u201cknock and talks\u201d to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.",
      "More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game \u2014 a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.",

      "Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School\u2019s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo \u201cquite disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cKnow-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it\u2019s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.\u201d",
      "In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.",

      "The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.",
      "Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they\u2019re at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a \u201creasonable chance to act lawfully.\u201d But if that doesn\u2019t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.",
      "Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.",
      "With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.",
      "Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.",
      "\u201cThis would just be another step down that path,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.\u201d",

      "BOSTON -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as \u201cremedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs\u2019 noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "During the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an \u201cunconstitutional conspiracy\u201d to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to \u201cpick off certain people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,\u201d said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.\u201d",
      "In his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cUpon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,\u201d Young wrote.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment",
      "During last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.",
      "Among the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.",
      "The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn\u2019t decide the key issue in Khalil\u2019s case: whether the Trump administration\u2019s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.",
      "But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.",

      "The House has barely rejected a Democratic-backed resolution that would have prevented President Donald Trump from sending U.S. military forces to Venezuela",
      "WASHINGTON -- The House rejected a Democratic-backed resolution Thursday that would have prevented President Donald Trump from sending U.S. military forces to Venezuela after a tied vote on the legislation fell just short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The tied vote was the latest sign of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson's tenuous hold on the majority, as well as some of the growing pushback in the GOP-controlled Congress to Trump's aggressions in the Western Hemisphere. A Senate vote on a similar resolution was also tied last week until Vice President JD Vance broke the deadlock.",
      "To defeat the resolution Thursday, Republican leaders had to hold the vote open for more than 20 minutes while Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt, who had been out of Washington all week campaigning for a Senate seat in Texas, rushed back to Capitol Hill to cast the decisive vote.",
      "On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber's procedural rules. Two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voted with all Democrats for the legislation.",
      "The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. The Trump administration told senators last week that there are no U.S. troops on the ground in the South American nation and committed to getting congressional approval before launching major military operations there.",
      "But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and since Trump has stated plans to control the country's oil industry for years to come.",
      "Thursday's vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the U.S. from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will in the Western Hemisphere. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.",
      "Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of \u201cspite\u201d for Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that you don\u2019t want President Trump to arrest Maduro, and you will condemn him no matter what he does, even though he brought Maduro to justice with possibly the most successful law enforcement operation in history,\u201d Mast added.",
      "Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,\u201d Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said during a floor debate. \u201cThis isn't making America great again. It\u2019s making us isolated and weak.\u201d",
      "Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support. As part of that effort, Secretary of State Marco Rubio committed to a briefing next week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Yet Trump's insistence that the U.S. will possess Greenland over the objections of Denmark, a NATO ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.",

      "The War Powers Resolution was passed in the Vietnam War era as the U.S. sent troops to conflicts throughout Asia. It attempted to force presidents to work with Congress to deploy troops if there hasn't already been a formal declaration of war.",
      "Under the legislation, lawmakers can also force votes on legislation that directs the president to remove U.S. forces from hostilities.",
      "Presidents have long tested the limits of those parameters, and Democrats argue that Trump in his second term has pushed those limits farther than ever.",
      "The Trump administration left Congress in the dark ahead of the surprise raid to capture Maduro. It has also used an evolving set of legal justifications to blow up alleged drug boats and seize sanctioned oil tankers near Venezuela.",

      "In one of the first transactions, the U.S. granted Vitol, the world's largest independent oil broker, a license worth roughly $250 million.

      "When big winter storms move in, they can bring nasty weather that ranges from snow to sleet and freezing rain \u2014 or maybe extreme and dangerous cold.",
      "Here's a look at some weather conditions and how they vary from place to place.",
      "To stick, snow needs consistent cold air all the way from where flakes form in the clouds to the ground. If it's below freezing the whole way, the snowflakes never melt, so nothing turns to ice.",
      "\u201cThe further north, the deeper that Arctic layer is, the more likely to support snow,\u201d said MIT research scientist Judah Cohen.",
      "Farther south, the atmosphere may include a sandwich of warm air between cold layers. That's how sleet and freezing rain happen.",
      "\u201cThe snowflakes form, they fall and then they meet a warm layer, a layer above freezing, and they will melt. But then there's another layer near the surface that's below freezing again, so they will refreeze before they hit the ground,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Sleet requires the lowest layer to be cold enough that raindrops refreeze when they hit the ground, creating bouncy ice pellets. If that lower cold layer is shallow, the rain doesn't have enough time to freeze in the air. So it hits the ground as raindrops that freeze when they make contact.",
      "Then there's graupel, which is a rarer mix between snow and sleet. Not quite fluffy, and not quite hard.",
      "\u201cIt's snow that has tried to melt on its way down, but not quite melted,\u201d said David Robinson, New Jersey state climatologist at Rutgers University. \u201cIt's out of that six-point crystalline shape and has begun to look more like a cotton ball. So it hasn't gotten to the point of full melt that it could then refreeze as sleet.\u201d",
      "There's also hail, which Robinson said some people mistakenly use to describe sleet. But real hail probably isn't happening in a winter storm. That usually happens in the summer because it requires warmer air that's closer to the surface. That creates an updraft that allows rain to move up, freeze, fall, and move up again, forming layers of ice similar to the layers of an onion.",
      "Snow can be dangerous \u2014 sufficient to send cars skidding into ditches and be life-threatening in whiteout conditions. But at least it can be plowed.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- An opinion by Florida's Republican attorney general calling into question the constitutionality of dozens of state laws which support minority contracting and promote diverse appointments ignores that racial discrimination still exists and could harm the state's Black residents, Democratic state lawmakers said Thursday.",
      "Attorney General James Uthmeier released the opinion on Monday, when many U.S. residents were celebrating the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which honors the civil rights leader who fought to end racial segregation in the middle of the 20th century.",
      "Uthmeier claimed in his opinion that around 80 Florida laws and programs which provide loans to Black businesses and set aside contracts for minority businesses, among other things, violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because \u201cthey mandate discrimination based on race.\u201d He said he would no longer enforce or defend \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d provisions in those laws.",
      "Members of the Florida Legislative Black Caucus denounced the opinion at a news conference on Thursday. They decried it as a political stunt that could end decades of bipartisan policies while ignoring Florida's history of racial discrimination. Up until the 1960s, Florida subscribed to the legal system of racial segregation in schools and public accommodations known as Jim Crow.",
      "\u201cI know he doesn\u2019t understand this, and I know he doesn\u2019t have our lived experience, but I wish he would listen when we explain the reality of our lives and what people go through in our communities,\u201d said state Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who is the Democratic leader in the GOP-controlled Florida House. \u201cCivil rights laws are protections against discrimination, not preferences. This is about leveling the playing field, making sure that Floridians who look like us, and Floridians who look like the attorney general, have the same opportunities.\u201d",
      "Uthmeier, who is white, was named to his position last year by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis after then-state Attorney General Ashley Moody was appointed by the governor to a U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Marco Rubio when he became President Donald Trump's secretary of state.

      "CHICAGO -- The fate of a Chicago man accused of using Snapchat to offer a $10,000 bounty on the life of a top Border Patrol commander rested in a federal jury\u2019s hands Thursday.",
      "Juan Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old carpenter, was charged with a single count of murder-for-hire in the first criminal trial out of the Chicago area immigration crackdown. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that\u2019s the latest test of the Trump administration\u2019s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.",
      "At the heart of the government\u2019s case are Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part \u201c10k if u take him down,\u201d along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including last year in the Chicago area.",
      "\u201cThose words do not indicate that this was a joke,\u201d First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during closing arguments. \u201cThose words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.\u201d",
      "But defense attorneys said the government didn\u2019t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as \u201cneighborhood gossip\u201d after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn\u2019t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.",
      "\u201cSending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it\u2019s not murder for hire,\u201d his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. \u201cIt\u2019s not a federal crime.\u201d",
      "If convicted, Espinoza Martinez faces up to 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being \u201cfixated and obsessed\u201d with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.",
      "Espinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the Chicago area was in the federal spotlight. Protests, arrests and tense standoffs with immigration agents were common throughout the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs, especially in the city\u2019s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.",
      "He did not testify at his trial.",
      "But attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t threaten anyone,\u201d he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I was telling them to do it.\u201d",

      "But several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS's narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.",

      "Federal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a \u201cranking member\u201d of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.",

      "He also praised the arrest of protesters who disrupted a church service in Minnesota on Sunday and said he expects more prosecutions to come. The protesters entered the church chanting \u201cICE out\u201d and \u201cJustice for Renee Good.\"",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re scaring little kids who are there to worship God on a Sunday morning,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThose people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"",
      "He added: \u201cJust as you have the right to protest, they have a right to worship God as they choose. And when you interrupt that, that is a violation of the law.\u201d",

      "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

In remote areas like the South Pacific, nuclear blast monitoring stations could potentially track the sonic booms to fine-tune the paths of descent.

      "In a companion article in Science, Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2019s Chris Carr, who was not involved in the study, said further research is needed to reduce the time between an object\u2019s final plunge and the determination of its course.",
      "For now, Carr said this new method \u201cunlocks the rapid identification of debris fall-out zones, which is key information as Earth\u2019s orbit is anticipated to become increasingly crowded with satellites, leading to a greater influx of space debris.\u201d",

      "The House has already passed eight of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund federal agencies and programs. If the final four bills pass on Thursday, action would then move to the Senate, with final passage needed before a Jan. 30 deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown.",

      "\u201cThere's a very big concern about ICE being out of control,\u201d said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic lawmaker on the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "But Democrats have few good options to express their opposition. DeLauro said that passing a continuing resolution to fund Homeland Security at current levels for the remainder of the budget year would cede spending decisions to Trump. There's also little appetite for another shutdown, even if it would affect only a portion of the federal government.",
      "\u201cThere is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for. But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "This year's Homeland Security bill holds spending for ICE roughly flat from the prior year. It also restricts the ability of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to unilaterally shift funding and allocate federal dollars as she sees fit.",
      "\u201cIt's not everything we wanted. We wanted more oversight. But, look, Democrats don't control the House. We don't control the Senate or the White House. But we were able to add some oversight over Homeland,\u201d said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, a member of the Appropriations panel. He said he intends to vote for the bill.",

      "Workers have been installing new gargoyles on the facade of the Catholic cathedral in Covington, Kentucky, in January as they near the completion of a major renovation",
      "COVINGTON, Ky. -- Gargoyles have watched over this small Kentucky city for more than a century from their lofty perches on a cathedral known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Notre Dame.\u201d A new renovation will ensure they keep their posts for years to come on the meticulously restored facade of the towering stone sanctuary.",
      "Workers in recent weeks have been installing new terra cotta gargoyles as one of the final steps of a major, two-year restoration of the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption. The Catholic cathedral's nickname stems from how its exterior was modeled on the larger Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris \u2014 from the pointed arches and flying buttresses to the gargoyles and chimeras with their reptilian grins and piercing, canine eyes.",
      "Unlike the Paris landmark, which recently underwent a massive renovation because of a sudden and devastating fire, the Covington cathedral needed a rehab due to the slow deterioration of old stone, metal and terra cotta after 125 years of exposure to the elements in its Ohio River city across from Cincinnati.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves blessed to be able to ensure the cathedral is taken care of for coming generations,\u201d said Assumption\u2019s rector, the Very Rev. Ryan Maher.",
      "Workers have been painstakingly repairing and replacing tons of Indiana limestone. The new gargoyles are replicas based on meticulous scans of the 32 worn originals.",
      "Workers aim to complete the two-year restoration by March. The finishing touch will be the installation of new 26 chimeras along the rooftop. These grotesque creatures, similar to gargoyles, are exact replicas of their weathered predecessors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that you\u2019re able to replicate a piece that was built a hundred years ago by men that are no longer with us,\u201d said Brian Walter, executive vice president of Trisco Systems, the prime contractor for the restoration.",
      "Workers have faced numerous challenges throughout the project: hoisting and fitting heavy stones into the fa\u00e7ade while operating cranes above a busy street in the heat, cold and wind. They have been patching and fixing what they can and replacing other parts entirely.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an art and a science that\u2019s passed down from generation to generation,\u201d Walter said. \u201cEvery part of it is challenging.\u201d",
      "Those challenges began long before the materials even arrived at the cathedral, for a project involving architects, stonecutters, terra cotta artists and more.",
      "Workers made precise scans of deteriorated finials, arches, balustrades and other architectural elements so stonecutters could make exact matches. Organizers sourced stone from Bedford, Indiana, where limestone for the original cathedral was quarried.",
      "Over the generations, the cathedral has had several renovations and overhauls, with exterior statues added in 2019.",
      "But Maher knew a comprehensive exterior renovation was needed when, in 2018, he found a large, fallen piece of stone \u2014 evidence of a wider deterioration.",
      "This time, workers used more durable stainless steel pins and brackets to secure the stone and replace the original carbon steel, which had rusted.",
      "The cathedral opened in 1901, following a multiyear construction campaign by the Belgian-born Bishop Camillus Paul Maes, head of the Diocese of Covington and an admirer of the French Gothic style.",
      "While the exterior is modeled on Notre Dame, it has adaptations. It is just under half of the Paris cathedral\u2019s size, lacking the original\u2019s twin towers and featuring a narrower but still imposing fa\u00e7ade. The high-vaulted interior, bathed in light from large stained-glass windows, is modeled on another landmark Paris cathedral, Saint-Denis.",

      "\u201cAt the time, no one had ever heard of Covington,\u201d Enzweiler said.",
      "Maes wanted a sanctuary large enough to accommodate the rapidly growing immigrant Catholic population and grand enough to fulfill the medieval vision of a cathedral that would \u201crepresent heaven on earth,\u201d he said.",
      "The cathedral was part of a larger Gothic revival happening around the turn of the century that also saw the emergence of such landmark cathedrals as St. Patrick\u2019s and St. John the Divine in New York.",
      "\u201cThis is a smaller version of that revival of French Gothic in America, done at a very high level in a little town at the time, of surprisingly high quality,\u201d said Duncan Stroik, an architect, professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame and author of \u201cThe Church Building as a Sacred Place: Beauty, Transcendence and the Eternal.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows the talent of the bishop, the architect and the craftsmen,\u201d he said.",
      "Ironically, some of that Gothic revival wasn\u2019t quite as medieval as it may seem. The movement drew strong influence from the mid-19th century renovation of the Paris cathedral after the popular novel, \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame,\u201d called attention to its deterioration.",
      "Notre Dame's renovation architect, Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, added new elements such as the gargoyle-like chimeras on the rooftop. Unlike the gargoyles on Notre Dame, which double as rainspouts, the Covington sanctuary's fantastical creatures are purely decorative.",
      "Theories vary about the medieval intent behind the gargoyles. Were they to ward off evil spirits? Did they represent the demonic realm outside the sanctuary of the church? Were they allegorical figures for morality lessons? Or simply the imaginative fruits of medieval craftsmen?",
      "In modern times, gargoyles and chimeras have often become objects of endearment \u2014 portrayed by Disney as animated comic sidekicks and replicated in miniature as bookends, figurines and garden art. The Covington cathedral\u2019s newsletter is named the Gargoyle Gazette.",
      "The renovation price tag is $7.8 million, most of which has been raised. More than 2,000 donors contributed, along with foundations, Maher said.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of an easy sell, because of what the cathedral means to not only our parishioners but to the whole community,\u201d he said.",
      "The goal is to maintain the cathedral as a sanctuary for years to come.",
      "\u201cWhen everything is upside down, this is a place of people where people can experience the calm of the Lord,\u201d Maher said.",

      "Data collected from 35 American cities showed a 21% decrease in the homicide rate from 2024 to 2025, translating to about 922 fewer homicides last year, according to a new report from the independent Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The report, released on Thursday, tracked 13 crimes and recorded drops last year in 11 of those categories including carjackings, shoplifting, aggravated assaults and others. Drug crimes saw a small increase over last year and sexual assaults stayed even between 2024 and 2025, the study found.",
      "Experts said cities and states beyond those surveyed showed similar declines in homicides and other crimes. But they said it's too early to tell what is prompting the change even as elected officials at all levels \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have been claiming credit.",
      "Adam Gelb, president and CEO of the council \u2014 a nonpartisan think tank for criminal justice policy and research \u2014 said that after historic increases in violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, this year brought historic decreases. The study found some cities recorded decades-low numbers, with the overall homicide rate dropping to its lowest in decades",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dramatic drop to an absolutely astonishing level. As we celebrate it we also need to unpack and try to understand it,\u201d Gelb said. \u201cThere\u2019s never one reason crime goes up or down.\u201d",
      "The council collects data from police departments and other law enforcement sources. Some of the report categories included data from as many as 35 cities, while others because of differences in definitions for specific crimes or tracking gaps, include fewer cities in their totals. Many of the property crimes in the report also declined, including a 27% drop in vehicle thefts and 10% drop in shoplifting among the reporting cities.",
      "The council's report showed a decrease in the homicide rate in 31 of 35 cities including a 40% decrease or more in Denver, Omaha, Nebraska, and Washington. The only city included that reported a double-digit increase was Little Rock, Arkansas, where the rate increased by 16% from 2024.",
      "Gelb said the broad crime rate decreases have made some criminologists question historic understandings of what drives trends in violent crime and how to battle it.",
      "\u201cWe want to believe that local factors really matter for crime numbers, that it is fundamentally a neighborhood problem with neighborhood level solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that broad, very broad social, cultural and economic forces at the national level can assert huge influence on what happens at the local level.\u201d",

      "Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana in South America and a former Olympic runner, ascended as an exuberant and inspiring leader over a two-decade career in urban education. For two years, he was superintendent of the Des Moines public school district, which serves 30,000 students.",
      "Just weeks into a new school year, Roberts was detained by federal immigration officers. The Sept. 26 arrest stunned community members and drew national attention to his history of criminal charges and falsified credentials.",
      "Roberts in October initially pleaded not guilty to one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of unlawfully possessing a firearm while being in the country illegally. Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Roberts is expected to plead guilty to both charges, according to a plea agreement he signed Wednesday.",

According to the plea agreement, Roberts admits he knowingly and intentionally made a \u201cfalse attestation\u201d on the Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, that he submitted in Des Moines, claiming he was a U.S. citizen even he lacked authorization.

      "George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Paul Mescal,\u00a0  Amanda Seyfried, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis and Brad Pitt are some of Hollywood's biggest names who failed to receive an Oscar nomination in acting categories when the nominees for the 98th Academy Awards were announced in Hollywood on Thursday.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, both nominees last year for their performances in \"Wicked,\" were not similarly nominated for the sequel. In fact, \"Wicked: For Good,\" was shut out of all categories.",
      "On the opposite end, \"Sinners\" broke the record for Oscar nominations, with 16, including one in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' newest category, best casting. \"One Battle After Another\" followed with 13 nominations, while \"Frankenstein,\" \"Marty Supreme\" and \"Sentimental Value\" each earned nine.",
      "Best actor",
      "Clooney, who played a Hollywood star much like himself in \"Jay Kelly,\" was left off the best actor list, as were Jesse Plemons (\"Bugonia\"), Oscar Isaac (\"Frankenstein\"), Jeremy Allen White (\"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\"), Daniel Day-Lewis (\"Anemone\"), Joaquin Phoenix (\"Eddington\"), and Denzel Washington (\"Highest 2 Lowest\"). Hugh Jackman was not nominated for \"Song Sung Blue,\" though his partner in the film, Kate Hudson, was. Joel Edgerton, the central pillar of the film \"Train Dreams,\" was not nominated, though the picture earned four nominations, including best picture.

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",
      "\"One Battle After Another\" didn't do too terribly for itself, racking up 13 nominations total, including a double-dip in best supporting actor between Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn.",
      "\"Frankenstein,\" \"Sentimental Value\" and \"Marty Supreme\" earned nine nominations each, and \"Hamnet\" landed eight.",
      "What were the biggest snubs of the Oscar nominations?",
      "Among acting snubs, Chase Infiniti (\"One Battle After Another\") was tipped to be nominated for best actress, and Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet\") was expected in best supporting actor, however some noted that there may have been category confusion over whether the two were leading or supporting performances.",

      "2026 Academy Award snubs and surprises: Who did Oscar leave out?",
      "Many expected Iranian director Jafar Panahi to make the best director shortlist for his Palme d'Or-winning feature \"It Was Just an Accident.\" He did secure a nomination for best original screenplay, and the film itself landed in a very competitive best international feature race, but many thought it would also factor into the best picture category.",
      "The best director race was always going to boast a few high-profile snubs, but most expected Guillermo Del Toro (\"Frankenstein\") to factor in, given his nomination at the Directors Guild Awards.",
      "After \"Wicked\" earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, many thought its sequel would factor into at least a few races, despite more tepid critical notices. In the end, the film was blanked entirely. Not quite as stark a departure from earlier heats, but James Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" also earned just two nominations, a franchise low.",

    "story": [
      "The Sundance Film Festival, America's leading showcase for independent narrative and documentary films from the United States and around the world, opens its 2026 edition on Thursday. This year's festival presents nearly 100 features through Feb. 1, in-person\u00a0in Utah and online.",
      "This year's program includes dramatic films with stars including Natalie Portman, Channing Tatum, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Olivia Wilde, Chris Pine, Ethan Hawke, Keegan Michael-Key, and Charli XCX.

There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",

Shot over 10 years, Itab Azzam and Jack MacInnes' \"One in a Million\" follows a girl navigating war and heartbreak as she travels from Syria to Germany, and later returns to Aleppo.",
      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

      "And under less-deadly circumstances, John Wilson (the dryly satirical voice behind HBO's \"How To with John Wilson\") goes through the process of trying to sell a documentary about building materials in \"The History of Concrete.\"",
      "Narrative features",
      "Pixar veteran Andrew Stanton (\"WALL-E\") directs the live-action \"In The Blink of an Eye,\" a trilogy of stories spanning thousands of years, from the lives of cave dwellers, to an astronaut light-years from Earth.

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified in his lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",

      "Leading the class of 2026 is Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, who came together in 1973 to form the unlikely creative partnership that became KISS.",
      "\"No, I didn't like [Simmons] at all. There's days he annoys me now,\" joked Stanley in a 2014 interview with CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason.",
      "But the two Jewish New Yorkers bonded over their backgrounds and shared work ethic. With Stanley, Simmons said, \"One and one is three.\"",
      "Next is Christopher \"Tricky Stewart,\" who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonc\u00e9's blockbuster hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" Raised in a musical family in Markham, Illinois, Stewart was writing songs by age 12.",
      "His big break came in 2007, with what he calls the \"single most important song\" he's ever written: Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He once told MTV about the song's success, \"When she recorded the 'ellas,' you knew your life was about to change if you had anything to do with that record.\"",
      "You oughta know the next artist on the list: Alanis Morissette.",
      "Morissette's breakup anthem, \"You Oughta Know,\" was written from what she described as fractured devastation. With her blistering lyrics, the Canadian singer set off a cultural earthquake. Her 1995 album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" sold 33 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"When I write songs, everything that jumps to the fore \u2013 lyrically and musically \u2013 is that which I have sublimated or repressed. So, it's all my unconscious writing,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers in November.",
      "Other Hall of Famers, Terry Britten and Graham Lyle helped lift Tina Turner from soul singer to superstar, writing many of Turner's greatest hits, including \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" and \"We Don't Need Another Hero.\"",

      "Kenny Loggins' songwriting career has had many chapters, from performing in the 70s with Jim Messina to going solo to writing with Michael McDonald. In the 80s, he became the king of soundtracks with music featured in \"Caddyshack,\" \"Footloose\" and \"Top Gun.\"",
      "\"There's just a part of my brain that's kind of scoring everything,\" Loggins said in a 2022 PBS interview.",
      "Then there's Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote and co-produced Mariah Carey's No. 1 smash, \"Hero.\" And then again, for the holiday classic, \"All I Want For Christmas is You.\"",
      "\"We'd play musical ping pong,\" he's said of his more than 11-year collaboration with Carey.",

      "Last but not least, there's Taylor Swift.",
      "Since signing a publishing deal at 14 years old, Swift has gone on to land 69 songs in the Top 10. Thirteen of those - her favorite number - have hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Swift's newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day in 2025.",
      "In a 2019 interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Swift said many of her songs are written overnight, when inspiration unexpectedly strikes",

    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Busfield was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail uniform in a New Mexico state district court, while wife and actor Melissa Gilbert watched from the court gallery.",
      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

      "\"Queer Eye\" star Karamo Brown was notably absent from Tuesday's \"CBS Mornings\" live interview with the full cast as they promoted the release of the series' 10th and final season, citing a need to prioritize his mental health.",
      "Roughly an hour before the interview, Brown's assistant informed \"CBS Mornings\" that the cast member wouldn't be joining the on-set interview due to mental health concerns and, in part, because he was worried about being bullied.",
      "In a statement released to \"CBS Mornings\" explaining his absence, Brown said, \"Thank you to everyone around the world for welcoming me into their homes for 10 seasons. Season 10 is amazing and I know you will fall in love with the deserving people we helped.\"",

Thank you to the crew for being the best in business and the executives for believing in me. 10 Seasons, I'm truly humbled.\"",

      "Van Ness said he's honored to have learned from Brown during their time together on the show.",
      "\"He has taught people to center what they need and I'm actually really proud of him. Center what you need. Do the things you need to take care of you. I'd be lying if I didn't feel like that sometimes,\" Van Ness said. \"And so, I think it's really beautiful, and I think we do need to center what is best for us sometimes and my hat off to him for doing that today.\"",
      "Brent called his experience with the group transformative, saying, \"I have felt safe and supported by the people up here. I have loved every second of this thing and I'm so excited that we get to do this and share this next season because the show really is just about highlighting the best of humanity.\"",
      "10th and final season",
      "In the very first episode of the series, France said they were working toward acceptance, but as the show comes to a close, he revealed he isn't sure that's happened yet.",
      "\"I would love to believe that we have come around to that, but as we've seen, especially over the last year or so, that hasn't been the case here in particular in the U.S. I pray we will continue to fight for acceptance but it is not just ours,\" France said. \"It is our entire nation's responsibility at this point to fight for those who can't fight for themselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Prince Harry was back in London on Monday, sitting in the U.K.'s highest court to take part in the third and final of his outstanding legal battles against Britain's tabloid newspapers.",
      "Harry is among the high-profile claimants, along with Sir Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, who have accused the Associated Newspapers group of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
      "The 41-year-old royal, who lives in California, and his fellow celebrities claim the company, which publishes the Daily Mail and the linked MailOnline website, illegally snooped on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records to generate scoops.",
      "The publisher has denied all of the accusations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a coordinated effort driven by the claimants' personal dislike of the news media.",
      "In a witness submission seen by CBS News, Harry said it was, \"disturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\" adding that the \"terrifying\" intrusion made him, \"paranoid beyond belief, isolating me.\"",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",
      "The case against Associated Newspapers is expected to last nine weeks, culminating with a decision by Judge Matthew Nicklin, whose verdict will determine not only the lasting reputation of a major media company, but also who foots the bill for tens of millions of dollars in legal costs.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Nikkhah told CBS News. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "But Apatow is more at home behind the camera, as a director of comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\" and of documentaries about some of his idols, like comedians Garry Shandling and George Carlin.",
      "His latest subject hardly needs an introduction.",
      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",
      "In the documentary, Brooks described his wartime experience:",
      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right. Forty-five degree angle with your bayonet, go through the soil, find, find, find, dink dink. Oh, oh!\"",
      "\"I said to him, you know, \"Did you ever think that you were gonna die?'\" Apatow recalled. \"And he goes, 'Only every second of every day.'\"",
      "Brooks came home from the war, but he never really stopped fighting the Nazis \u2013 lampooning them in \"The Producers,\" \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and \"History of the World Part I.\"",
      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

    "summary": "The Swedish actor has been in 150 films and TV shows, from \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" to \"Andor.\" He talks about his Golden Globe-winning performance in \"Sentimental Value,\" playing a filmmaker-father trying to reconcile with his actress-daughters.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd may be well-known in Sweden \u2013 his picture is prominently displayed at the airport \u2013 but he dismisses that it is a big deal. \"Sweden is a small country!\" he laughs.",
      "He's self-effacing, and while Skarsg\u00e4rd was recognized during our stroll through his hometown of Stockholm, respectful, shy Swedes may help keep any Hollywood-actor-ego in check. Skarsg\u00e4rd noted, \"They don't say like Americans \u2013 OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!!!\"",
      "He's recognizable from any number of roles over the decades, from Hollywood blockbusters (\"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\"), popular streaming shows (\"Andor\"), European art-house fare (\"Breaking the Waves\"), and even an ABBA musical.",
      "I said, \"This morning I was watching you singing in 'Mamma Mia'...\"",
      "\"Oh. Watching is okay, but listening to it?\" Skarsg\u00e4rd laughed. \"I've tried to get into projects where I enjoy myself and have a fun time. And that's why I'm not bored. I made 150 films. I still love it, you know?\"",
      "\"It seems impossible to make that many films,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, some are very short.\"",
      "His break came at age 16 on Swedish television, in \"Bombi Bitt och jag.\" Now, at 74, he's reached a new high, in the Norwegian film \"Sentimental Value.\" He plays a once-successful filmmaker trying to reconcile with his estranged daughters.",
      "He described getting the role as a chef's kiss.",
      "\"You think this is the best role for you ever?\" I asked.",
      "\"Maybe \u2013 I don't know,\" Skarsg\u00e5rd replied.",
      "He picked up a Golden Globe for his performance just last week.",
      "He has many moments in the film where the camera just watches him, where he's not saying much, but he is saying a lot with his expression. \"I love that stuff,\" he said. \"Movies, real movies are not literature. Cinema to me is what happens in the image. Not what is said; what is not said.\"",
      "In the film, he plays a father of two. In real life he's the father of eight. All live nearby, and all have worked in the film industry, five of them actors. \"It's insane,\" he said of the \"family business.\" \"I mean, what is the chance? I didn't encourage them. They have no illusions about the business. They see I am I'm happy and I'm enjoying what I'm doing, so they probably learn from that.\"",
      "He playfully sparred with one of his sons, Alexander, when the two were nominated for the same Gotham Award last year.",
      "Alexander: \"'Sentimental Value,' beautiful film. You play yourself, right?\"Stellan: \"That's an insult.\"Alexander: \"Absentee father.\"",
      "I asked Stellan, \"Did you ever find that you had difficulty in balancing family and career?\"",
      "\"I sort of made sure that I was at home a lot,\" he replied. \"You can't be a perfect father always. I mean, you gotta accept, and the kids have to accept, I'm flawed. Good luck!\"",
      "At Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, he recalled appearing in Moliere's \"The School of Wives,\" but stumbled on the name of his co-star. \"That's what I'm talking about,\" he said. \"Had a stroke. That makes me forget my language, forget words, and that makes me more stupid and makes me less funny and everything.\"",
      "\"Do you really feel that? Less funny?\"",
      "\"I felt so funny before.\"",
      "\"Must be tough.\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, I'm 74 years old, and I'm alive.\"",
      "Since that 2022 stroke, he wears an earpiece on set to help with lines. \"It's actually more complicated than learning the lines, because the prompter has to say their line while the other actor is talking,\" he said.",
      "He wore it while shooting \"Sentimental Value,\" a film about the pull between career and what's really important.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"I've had kids in the '70s, in the '80s, in the '90s, in the '00s, and in the '10s.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you learn more from having kids for five decades, or making 150 films?\"",
      "\"Maybe I couldn't have made 150 films if I hadn't have eight kids to learn from,\" he replied. \"I stole things from them. Like, expressions and the sort of naive attitude towards everything. Just watching them is fantastic.\"",
      "It's a curiosity in humanity that Skarsg\u00e5rd explores, and expresses, through acting. \"It is like being a child,\" he said. \"You never grow up. You're allowed to play all the time, even as an adult.\"",
      "\"Is that how you feel now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. It's make-believe, and kids in the sandbox, they do it all the time. And they shouldn't stop.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:17:36 -0500",
    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, China and the U.S. have signed off on a deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms,keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "TikTok confirmed Thursday that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a statement late Thursday. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS News. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",

      "The suit, filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County, claims that Mr. Trump and his hospitality companies \"suffered considerable financial harm and losses\" in early 2021 when he and his companies were debanked, because of what the suit called JPMorgan Chase's \"woke beliefs.\" Debanking occurs when financial institutions refuse to work with individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, Alejandro Brito, alleged the debanking had a \"devastating impact\" on the ability of Mr. Trump and his businesses to transact and access assets, and caused \"extensive reputational harm by being forced to reach out to other financial institutions in an effort to move their funds and accounts, making it clear that they had been debanked by JPMC.\" The president's companies were given notice in February 2021 they should take their business elsewhere, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit also alleges that Mr. Trump, his family, and businesses were blacklisted by the bank. It claims JPMorgan Chase urged other financial institutions \"to not carry on business relationships,\" with them, forcing the Trumps and their businesses to accept a \"limited menu of options and less advantageous terms\" at other banks.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said the suit is meritless.",

      "\"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons,\" the bank added. \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking sector.\"",
      "The suit was filed the same day the president left the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Dimon also spoke.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the threat of a lawsuit over the weekend. On Saturday, he said in a post on Truth Social, \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"",
      "Debanking has been a focus for the administration for months. In August, the president signed an executive order that alleged that \"financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals' and businesses' access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\" It also directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate the matter.",
      "The OCC's preliminary report, issued in December, said it had found early evidence that nine of the biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 had improperly refused to do business with a range of industries. The six-page report did not identify clients who had been debanked or the institutions alleged to have engaged in the practice.",
      "\"While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy,\" the comptroller of the currency said in a statement. \"The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.\"",

      "Senior Trump administration officials are forecasting a boom for the U.S. economy in 2026, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and historically large tax refunds.",
      "\"This quarter \u2014 the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 the United States of America's $30 trillion economy will exceed 5% growth,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox Business on Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By the end of 2026, he added, \"You're going to see 6% growth from the United States of America.\"",
      "That would mark the fastest economic growth since late 2021, when the economy grew at a blistering 7% annual pace after many businesses started reopening during the pandemic. Outside of a few post-pandemic statistical outliers, economic activity in the U.S. has historically moved at a far more measured pace, typically averaging between 2% and 3% per quarter on an annualized basis.",
      "As outlined by Lutnick, the U.S. economy could get a lift this year if President Trump appoints a new Federal Reserve chair more inclined to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate, a move that could spur growth. Consumers could also have more money in their pockets from larger tax refunds under the Republicans' tax and spending law, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's possible \u2014 I would say it's even likely on a one-off basis,\" Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at financial services company Truist, told CBS News of Mr. Lutnick's forecast. But he added that maintaining that growth for a full year is \"a really tough hill to climb.\"",
      "That's because a number of economic headwinds are likely to persist into 2026 and could blunt any lift from lower borrowing costs and larger tax refunds, Skordeles said. Those include trade tensions stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, as well as business uncertainty driven by the administration's shifting economic policies.",
      "\"Those are not positives for the economy,\" Skordeles told CBS News. \"One of those reasons why we're not growing faster is uncertainty.\"",
      "Truist forecasts 2.3% economic growth for all of 2026, while projections by other Wall Street economists range from 2% to 2.5%.",
      "A White House official pointed out that Lutnick's forecast is in line with the Atlanta Fed's forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%.",
      "Risk of overheating",
      "The latest readings on the U.S. economy show a jump in growth, with third-quarter GDP expanding at a 4.3% annualized rate, according to recent government data.",
      "On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is \"likely accelerating,\" citing an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tool that pegs fourth-quarter GDP growth at 5.4%. The Commerce Department will announce fourth-quarter growth data on Feb. 20.",
      "Yet there are risks to boosting the economy through interest-rate cuts and bigger tax refunds. Those same catalysts contributed to the searing inflation that drove the Consumer Price Index to a 40-year high in 2022.",
      "\"What the secretary was intimating earlier today, to me, that doesn't unlock a bunch of growth \u2014 it unlocks a bunch of inflation,\" Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundworks, a liberal-leaning think tank.",
      "Inflation still isn't down to the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate, with the December CPI showing that prices rose at a 2.7% annualized rate. Food prices remain elevated, rising at an annual pace of 3.1% last month due to sharply higher costs of staples like beef and coffee.",
      "\"It's not a single silver bullet that if we just lowered the [Fed's interest] rate, it would make everything magically better,\" Skordeles said. \"You start giving these tax incentives, and you put more money in people's pockets \u2014 it's the classic 'too many dollars chasing too few goods'.\"",
      "Would workers benefit?",
      "Consumers remain generally dour about the U.S. economy, with recent CBS News polling finding that Americans want Mr. Trump to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "\"Lower-income households have experienced weaker wage growth in 2025, while inflation has steadily eroded their checking and savings balances,\" analysts with PNC Economics Research said in a report this week.",
      "While a stronger economy can translate into higher wages in many industries, workers are taking home a smaller slice of the economic pie. The labor share of the nation's GDP slid to its lowest point since 1947, dropping to 53.8% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Even sharply higher economic growth might not do much to assuage public frustration with the cost of food, rent and other affordability issues, Pancotti said, pointing to the example of the strong post-pandemic growth under President Joe Biden. While GDP grew at a 7% pace for two quarters in 2021, Americans were more focused on pocketbook issues such as higher grocery and housing costs, she added.",
      "\"Joe Biden had [strong GDP growth], and yet his marks on the economy were low, given that people want lower prices,\" she added. \"They want to be able to afford their grocery bills and send their kids to summer camp.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",

      "Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary offered Elon Musk a free flight as part of a \"big idiot\" promotion by the discount carrier, the company's tongue-in-cheek retort after the airline executive and technology mogul traded insults earlier this week.",
      "\"I suspect he's a bigger idiot than me, but nevertheless, he probably thinks I am a bigger idiot than him,\" O'Leary said on Wednesday during an hour-long press conference in Dublin, where Ryanair is based.",
      "The two have publicly sparred after O'Leary said he would not install WiFi gear from Starlink, the Musk-owned maker of satellite internet gear, on Ryanair planes out of concern that the extra weight from the system's antennas would drive up fuel costs.",
      "\"It is a terrific system. It works very well,\" O'Leary said.\u00a0 \"The problem is if you put it on board aircraft, there is a cost of that of about $200 million, $250 million a year, including the cost of installation and then the fuel drag.\"",
      "Starlink did not respond to a request for comment. Musk's SpaceX company developed Starlink to provide internet connectivity, launching its first batch of satellites in 2019.",
      "Ryanair declined to comment. The airline seized on the brouhaha on Tuesday to launch what it called a \"big idiot seat sale,\" offering 100,000 seats for 16.99 Euros for one-way fares.",
      "\"Ryanair is launching a Great idiot seat sale especially for Elon Musk and any other idiots on X,\" Ryanair\u00a0posted\u00a0on X on Tuesday. \"Buy now before Musk gets one!!!\"",
      "O'Leary said Wednesday that Ryanair had explored equipping its jets with Starlink's service, including meeting with executives from the telecom company, but ultimately rejected the idea.",
      "After O'Leary relayed that decision last week, Musk said on social media that the airline leader was \"misinformed.\" O'Leary subsequently told an Irish radio station that \"I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk, he's an idiot.\"",
      "In response, Musk took to X, his social media platform, to deride O'Leary as an \"utter idiot\" and an \"imbecile.\" Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of nearly $700 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 also launched a poll jestingly asking his followers whether he should buy Ryanair \"and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?\"",
      "O'Leary, who has led Ryanair as CEO for more than three decades, said on Wednesday that Musk is free to launch a takeover bid for the airline, while noting that rules bar non-European citizens from owning a majority stake in a European airline.",
      "\"But if he wants to invest in Ryanair, we would think it's a very good investment,\" O'Leary said. \"Certainly a significantly better investment than the financial returns he's earning on X.\"",

    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "For a worker earning $65,000, a 3.5% annual raise would amount to an additional $2,275 a year.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",
      "Small company, big raise",
      "Smaller establishments with fewer than 100 employees are offering higher pay increases \u2014 4% \u2014 compared to their larger counterparts. Businesses with between about 10,000 to 50,000 workers said they plan to hand out 3% raises in 2026, the report found.",
      "\"Smaller employers appear to be using pay more aggressively to compete for talent, while larger organizations face structural and budgetary challenges that limit flexibility,\" the researchers said in the report.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:01:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "By contrast, financial pros predicted the 10% cap would have little effect on higher-income bank customers.",
      "\"Americans who have investments and stable jobs aren't the ones with credit card debt. If you make $100,000, plus you're saving with a 401k, those clients will be largely unimpacted by this,\" Nick Holeman, director of financial planning at wealth advisor firm Betterment.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",

    "summary": "A new BNPL pilot from financial technology company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have historically turned to buy now, pay later (BNPL) financing to cover the cost of everyday expenses like groceries and consumer purchases such as clothing and furniture. Now, some of these lending companies are turning their attention to a bigger expense: Monthly rent.",
      "A new BNPL option from fintech company Affirm will give renters the option to break up their rent into two equal payments instead of a single lump sum payment.",
      "Affirm, one of the biggest BNPL companies, told CBS News the service is starting as a limited pilot program through a partnership with New York-based company Esusu. The latter company reports consumers' payment information to the major credit agencies, according to its website.",
      "A spokesperson from Affirm said the company underwrites every application and approves only people it believes can \"responsibly afford to repay.\"",
      "\"If a tenant applies through Esusu and is approved by Affirm, they are eligible to receive a 0% interest loan to be repaid in two, biweekly installments without any fees,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"Esusu and Affirm are not offering interest-bearing loans as part of this program.\"",
      "Affirm isn't the first company to offer BNPL loans for rent payments, but it could have a wider reach, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an association of non-profit consumer organizations. Approximately 24 million Americans use Affirm's BNPL services.",
      "\"Affirm is one of the leaders in this space,\" Rust said. \"Their reach is going to be different.\"",
      "The Affirm spokesperson did not disclose how long the pilot will last or whether it plans to expand the BNPL rent option once the pilot ends. Fintech company Zip also offers a BNPL product for rent, according to trade publication PaymentsDive.",
      "BNPL comes with risks",
      "BNPL has grown in popularity because it gives consumers the option to split their payments into multiple bite-sized installments rather than paying the full cost of big-ticket items up front.",
      "A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that upwards of 50 million consumers took out at least one BNPL loan in 2023 from one of the six major lenders in 2023.",
      "BNPL plans typically give customers the option to pay back the cost of a purchase in four installments with no interest, according to CFPB.",
      "While this may seem like an alluring option, it can come with hidden risks. Taking out multiple loans with different deadlines can make it difficult to keep track of repayments and lead to missed payments, for which some companies charge late fees.",
      "\"It is easy to get turned around,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree.",
      "In some cases, missed BNPL payments can get reported to the credit bureaus, taking a toll on your credit score.",
      "Affirm says on its website that it's the only major BNPL service to report loan activity to U.S. credit bureaus. The San Francisco-based company shares payment information with Experian and TransUnion, two of the three main credit reporting agencies.",
      "Housing security",
      "Experts, meanwhile, have warned that BNPL can be a slippery slope that can end up pushing consumers further into debt \u2014 an issue that could pose bigger risks when dealing with monthly rent.",
      "\"You can see the problem of how borrowing could lead to a death spiral that actually threatens a tenant's housing security,\" Rust said, adding that few examples exist where tenants can borrow money to pay their rent.",
      "Schulz thinks Affirm's new option could offer tenants more flexibility, but said it could also cause people to overextend themselves.",
      "\"They might feel like they can afford a bigger monthly rent because they're able to spread the cost out over multiple paychecks,\" he said. \"That's a pretty risky game.\"",
      "Still, Schulz thinks BNPL for rent will only continue to grow in popularity as people seek out flexible payment options.",
      "\"Lenders and businesses are clearly seeing the demand for these types of offerings, and I'd suspect that we will only see more of these loans in the near future,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel's acquisition last year by Japan's Nippon Steel came with a notable condition to win approval from the Trump administration: a so-called \"golden share\" that gives President Trump the power to approve certain major corporate decisions, including closing plants or changing locations. But CEO David Burritt tells CBS News, \"There's nothing in this golden share that prevents us from doing what we want to do.\"",
      "\"We're aligned with what the president wants us to do. In fact, we wouldn't agree to this thing if we weren't sure it was going to be great for our workers and great for our company,\" Burritt told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil at one of the company's plants in Pittsburgh.",
      "Burritt downplayed some of the provisions in the deal, saying there were certain aspects that would need approval, such as changing the company's name or being forced to follow existing trade laws, that don't have any impact on what U.S. Steel's plans were to begin with.",
      "But asked if the company would require Mr. Trump's approval for business decisions down the line, such as closing a plant, Burritt insisted, \"We don't see us closing the plant. In fact, we just did have an opening here because of demand increasing at Granite City [Illinois].\"",
      "Burritt said, despite Mr. Trump's own claims last year, that the president did not veto the company's decision to close down the Granite City operation, which had been dormant since 2023. He said the company recently restarted a blast furnace at the location due to increased customer demand.",
      "Burritt acknowledged that in the future, \"If we had to make a difficult business decision, we would have to get approval to close a plant.\"",
      "\"But we don't see a reason to do that,\" he added.",
      "\"We can't guarantee things are going to stay open,\" Burritt said. \"We are going to manage the business and we're going to keep a great relationship with this administration, who did so much for us and the United States, to help get this deal done.\"",
      "Burritt touted the acquisition, saying, \"Without the partnership, we would not be able to invest as much money as what we are now. ... This is really a wonderful thing for the workers, and the workers are the ones who made this happen.\"",
      "He also highlighted the $14 billion investment from the deal that, he says, the company will be spending in the coming years, supporting as many as \"100,000 direct or indirect jobs.\"",
      "Burritt said, despite the acquisition, U.S. Steel is \"absolutely\" still a U.S. company.",
      "\"U.S. Steel Corporation: That's our brand. That's our name. Headquartered right here in Pittsburgh, and we're gonna keep it there and continue to build here,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a fiduciary duty to national security. And we have a fiduciary duty to Nippon. We keep them aligned and it's a beautiful thing,\" he said, adding: \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Burritt called Mr. Trump's tariffs a \"game changer,\" saying, \"We really appreciate that the tariffs are in place. This strengthens national security, economic security and also makes sure we have job security and creates jobs.\"",

      "There are two main changes this year for homeowners stemming from the \"big, beautiful bill\" act that President Trump signed into law last year.",
      "The first is the expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The \"big, beautiful bill\" Act raises the cap from $10,000 to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $40,000 in combined property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.",
      "Single filers can now deduct up to to $40,000, while married couples can deduct up to $20,000 each if they are filing separately. The deduction phases out for people with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000.",

      "\"If you're someone who has a large, high-interest-rate mortgage, and you're living in a high property tax area, you could potentially get a significant boost from itemizing,\" she said. \"But if you're someone who's paying low interest, has a modest mortgage, is in a lower tax location, the standard deduction might be just fine for you.\"",
      "The second major change homeowners should be aware of is the elimination of energy-focused\u00a0home improvement tax credits, which were phased out at the end of 2025 under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The credits were intended to help taxpayers offset the cost of clean-energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels or improving insulation.",
      "To qualify for the credits this tax season, homeowners must have completed their energy upgrades in 2025, Wood said. \"Not just that you purchased the items, but that the work was completed by Dec. 31, 2025,\" she said.",

      "Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond \u2014 plus untold numbers of activists, journalists and outside observers \u2014 are converging in the Swiss town of Davos this week for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.",
      "What is the World Economic Forum?",
      "The forum is a think tank and event organizer based in Geneva whose main event \u2014 the annual meeting \u2014 debuted in 1971 in Davos, a ski-resort town of about 10,000 people at a height of about 1,500 meters (nearly 5,000 feet) in the Alps of eastern Switzerland.",
      "The first edition, hosted by forum founder Klaus Schwab, featured a gathering of business executives.",
      "Since then, the meeting has swelled into a catch-all conference on issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology, and global cooperation \u2014 as well as competition and conflict.",
      "This year's event runs from Jan. 19-23.",
      "What is the theme at this year's Davos forum?",
      "Davos conference organizers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year's is \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" \u2014 around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues.",
      "Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.",
      "The world's richest people saw their fortunes surge in 2025, part of a long-running trend of widening wealth inequality, according to a\u00a0new report from anti-poverty charity Oxfam released to coincide with the forum. The wealth of billionaires grew three times faster last year than the average pace of the previous five years, reaching a record $18.3 trillion, the group said.",
      "At the same time, one in four people worldwide experiences food insecurity and regularly skips meals, Oxfam said.",
      "\"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,\" said Oxfam executive director Amitabh Behar in a statement.",
      "Who will attend in 2026?",
      "Organizers says a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and nearly 850 chairs and chief executives of many of the world's leading companies.",
      "Headlining the lineup is U.S. President Donald Trump, who's set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several Cabinet ministers and top advisers including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, President Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Felix Tshisekedi of Congo, Vice Premier He Lifeng of China, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine are among the who's-who of top attendees.",
      "Organizers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.",
      "Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France's Mistral AI.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among scores of top officials from international institutions.",
      "What other issues are at stake?",
      "The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump's pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran \u2014 not to mention his tariff policies \u2014 have raised questions about America's role in the world.",
      "The advent of AI \u2014 its promise and perils \u2014 has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labor leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and right to innovate.",

      "The recalled products were produced on Oct. 14, 2025, and sold in 10-pound cases containing two 5-pound bags of cooked grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat, health officials said. They were sent to distribution centers for food service sales in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio.",
      "There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the consumption of the recalled products. Officials said the problem was discovered by a third-party laboratory, which tested the chicken fillets and reported a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes, a type of disease-causing bacteria that can infect people when they eat food that has been contaminated with it.",
      "The bacteria can be found in a number of places, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including soil, water, sewage, vegetation and animals. It can survive and grow even when products it contaminates are refrigerated, and is generally transmitted when food is \"harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes,\" the FDA says.",
      "Listeria infections are the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that 1,250 people contract the infection each year and 172 people die from it.",
      "Although no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products from Suzanna's Kitchen, officials have encouraged anyone with concerns to contact a healthcare provider.",

      "\"Why detain a 5-year-old? You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,\" said Superintendent Zena Stenvik.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later said that the child was not targeted by ICE, but was \"abandoned\" by his father. It said his father fled federal agents as they approached his vehicle, leaving the child. DHS said the father, whom they described as an illegal alien from Ecuador, was later taken into custody as other ICE officers stayed with the child.",

The father then came to the school to find out that both his daughter and wife had been taken.",

A U.S. official previously told CBS News that countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members of the Board of Peace rather than having a three-year membership, though payment was not required as a condition of joining.

      "Carney didn't name-check Mr. Trump, but the speech was widely interpreted in part as a response to Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, which has drawn scrutiny in recent days due to his push for the U.S. to take over Greenland.",
      "A day later, in his own speech in Davos, Mr. Trump lashed out at Carney, accusing him of showing ingratitude toward the U.S. despite getting \"a lot of freebies from us.\"",
      "\"I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. But they should be grateful to us,\" the president said at one point. \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"",

    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, China and the U.S. have signed off on a deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms,keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "TikTok confirmed Thursday that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a statement late Thursday. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS News. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",

      "A different source stressed that the process is not over, and the Justice Department could find other avenues to charge Lemon.",
      "The magistrate judge who declined to approve charges for Lemon was Douglas Micko, sources told CBS News. Micko previously worked as a federal public defender.",
      "Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday that the magistrate's actions \"confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter.\"",
      "\"Should the Department of Justice continue with a stunning and troubling effort to silence and punish a journalist for doing his job, Don will call out their latest attack on the rule of law and fight any charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said.",

      "On Thursday morning, Bondi announced two arrests connected to the church protests \u2014 Chauntyll Louisa Allen, who serves on the St. Paul School Board, and civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. Bondi alleged that Armstrong was involved in organizing the protest. Bondi later said a third person, William Kelly, was arrested.",

      "\"We can get them,\" Robert Keenan, an attorney in the Civil Rights Division, told the judge.",

    "summary": "A historic preservation nonprofit is trying to block ongoing construction of Trump's new White House ballroom.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's claims that it has the proper authority to continue construction on the East Wing site that was demolished last year.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon heard arguments Thursday on a motion brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to block the ongoing construction of the East Wing until the Trump administration goes through the appropriate approval processes, which it alleges the Trump administration has ignored.",
      "Friday's arguments focused primarily on two issues: whether the president can unilaterally renovate the White House and whether he can do it with private funds that were transferred to an office under his authority, rather than with funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Tad Heuer, an attorney representing the Trust, argued the law requires express approval from Congress to execute a project as significant as the 90,000 square-foot East Wing renovation.",
      "Congress provides the White House with a modest annual budget for the \"repair, alteration, and improvement\" of the building. The administration contends this authority encompasses the East Wing overhaul.",
      "Leon responded that the Trump administration's view is a \"very expansive definition,\" later adding that \"there's been an end-run around this oversight from Congress.\"",
      "Leon pressed senior Justice Department official Yaakov Roth, on whether \"ripping down the East Wing\" is similar to previous White House renovations, like the tennis pavilion added by Mr. Trump in his first term, or the swimming pool added in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. Roth argued it was akin to those projects.",
      "\"Come on. Be serious,\" Leon snapped.",
      "The $400 million ballroom is being privately financed. Donations were collected by a nonprofit organization, turned over to the National Park Service and then funneled to the Executive Residence at the White House, which is overseen by Mr. Trump.",
      "Leon repeatedly called the financing arrangement a \"Rube Goldberg,\" referring to the cartoonist and inventor who made complex contraptions to perform simple tasks.",
      "Roth argued that Mr. Trump \"cares about this, so he wanted to keep it in house,\" referring to the planning and financing for the project, which includes the ballroom, and a new secure bunker underneath it.",
      "\"Every construction truck of concrete\" that is brought to the East Wing site for construction constitutes irreparable harm to the public, Heuer said, arguing that Mr. Trump should have gone to Congress with a proposal to allocate funding for the ballroom before beginning demolition, instead of relying on a collection of private and corporate funds for the renovations.",
      "\"The president didn't want $400 million of taxpayer money to be used for this,\" Roth said of the ballroom, which is expected to be completed during the summer of 2028.",
      "He called any alleged harms \"speculative\" and said that Leon should not stop the construction in the middle of the project, citing \"national security implications\" and the risk of flooding or damage to the intact parts of the White House that are adjacent to construction.",
      "In December, the Trust filed the first major lawsuit against Mr. Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, arguing no president is allowed to tear down parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\" The historic preservation group argued that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law.",
      "A week later, Leon denied a temporary restraining order sought by the Trust, finding that the group had not established enough irreparable harm to pause the construction outright, but the judge said construction crews cannot build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist.",
      "Leon said he will likely issue an opinion in February.",
      "Earlier Friday, the administration provided an informational presentation to the Commission of Fine Arts. CFA advises the federal government on matters of design in the nation's capital.",
      "The presentation, led by White House official Joshua Fisher and chief architect Shalom Baranes, was similar to their presentation before the National Capital Planning Commission earlier this month.",
      "Baranes said the ballroom itself is expected to be about 22,000 square feet (110x200 feet) with 40-foot ceilings. It is expected to hold 1,000 guests for a formal seated dinner. The total East Wing renovation is slated to cover an area of approximately 89,000 square feet over two floors.",
      "On the upper floor, the renovated area will include the ballroom, a lobby, bathrooms and corridor connecting it to the East Room.",
      "And on the lower floor, there will be an office suite for the first lady, kitchen space, a movie theater and a corridor connecting the area to the main residence.",
      "The east wall of the structure, which faces the Treasury Department, has been redesigned from the original renderings. It will feature eight floor-to-ceiling windows and eight columns above the main guest entry stairway.",
      "Baranes promised a digital 3D rendering of the design in the coming weeks. He briefly mentioned the potential for renovations to the West Wing colonnade. He said no design work has been started but some structural assessments are underway.",
      "Mr. Trump recently appointed five new members to the CFA including Rodney Mims Cook Jr. who was voted chairman Thursday.",
      "Cook asked several questions about the project but seemed generally favorable to the design. His main concern was the scale of the building, as viewed from the south side of the White House complex.",
      "\"It's immense,\" Cook said. Baranes said the building's footprint extends just about 300 feet into the South Lawn.",
      "James McCrery, the commission's vice chairman, recused himself from the ballroom portion of the meeting because he was the project's original architect.",
      "Thursday's presentation did not require a vote from the commission. The White House will make another presentation at next month's CFA meeting.",

    "summary": "One year after President Trump announced it, the U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization. Infectious disease experts call the decision \"scientifically reckless.\"",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Trump announced \u2014 on the first day of his second term \u2014 that America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\"In my opinion, it's the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations' specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The loss of that funding and support is a matter of life and death, according to Dr. Judd Walson, an infectious disease physician, epidemiologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University who works to improve child survival, growth and development in low- and middle-income settings.",
      "\"There's an estimated over 750,000 excess deaths that will occur this year because of these changes, most of those in children,\" Walson told CBS News.",
      "Without U.S. participation and funding, he said, WHO has had to \"downsize considerably.\"",
      "\"There's less resources for data monitoring for potential threats such as pandemics, emerging disease threats. There's less resources for helping to support supply chains. All of those direct impacts of the financial consequences of our withdrawal are real, and there are many other impacts as well, that we will see as countries no longer have access to support their health systems,\" he said.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency's \"failure to adopt urgently needed reforms\" and its \"inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn't airborne, a stance it didn't officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \"shortsighted and misguided\" and \"scientifically reckless.\"",
      "\"It fails to acknowledge the fundamental natural history of infectious diseases. Global cooperation is not a luxury; it is a biological necessity,\" Nahass said.",
      "\"This not only makes Americans less safe, it makes the citizens of other nations less safe,\" Tom Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told KFF Health News when the plans were announced.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot wall itself off from transnational health threats,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",
      "It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.",
      "Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be \"at the front of the line\" when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",
      "Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but \"is China going to sign a contract with the United States?\" Gostin said. \"Are countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.\"",
      "Gostin also believes President Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.",
      "The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal \u2014 which it did \u2014 but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.",
      "The U.S. has not paid any of its dues for 2024 and 2025, leaving a balance of more than $133 million, according to WHO.",
      "An administration official denied that requirement Thursday, saying the U.S. had no obligation to pay prior to withdrawing as a member.",

    "story": [
      "The White House posted a photo on social media that was digitally altered to make it look like a protester was sobbing as she was arrested in connection with a protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Minnesota church.",
      "A photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong's arrest \u2014 showing Armstrong with a neutral expression \u2014 was first posted on X by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday morning. The image the White House posted appears the same except Armstrong's altered facial expression shows her distressed, with tears running down her face.",
      "The White House posted the image of Armstrong seemingly crying with a caption calling her \"a far-left agitator,\" roughly 30 minutes after Noem posted the initial image. The altered version was also reposted on X by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The White House's post drew a flood of comments from X users, with many saying the image appeared to have been manipulated.",
      "In response to CBS News' request for comment on whether the photo was altered, the White House press office sent a link to an X post by White House spokesman Kaelan Dorr referring to the post as a \"meme.\"",
      "\"Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,\" Dorr said on X.",
      "Digital forensics expert Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California Berkeley and co-founder and chief science officer at GetReal Security, told CBS News that while it's not clear how the image was altered, it was likely edited with AI.",
      "\"This is not the first time that the White House has shared AI-manipulated or AI-generated content. This trend is troubling on several levels. Not only are they sharing deceptive content, they are making it increasingly more difficult for the public to trust anything they share with us,\" Farid said.",
      "The arrest of Armstrong and several fellow protesters came amid a wave of protests across the Twin Cities following the fatal shooting of\u00a0 Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month.",
      "Armstrong is a civil rights attorney and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP who helped lead a demonstration during a Sunday service at Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local ICE officer apparently serves as a pastor. Noem said Armstrong is being charged under 18 USC 241, a statute that prohibits the intimidation of someone exercising a Constitutional right.",
      "She is expected to be released after a judge rejected a request for a detention hearing.",
      "Two others, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly, were also arrested Thursday in connection to the Cities Church demonstration, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. But a magistrate judge refused to sign a complaint charging independent journalist Don Lemon in connection with that protest, multiple sources familiar with the proceedings told CBS News.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House defeated the latest war powers resolution on Thursday in response to President Trump's recent military operation in Venezuela.",
      "Democrats continue to hammer the issue and have repeatedly tried to block further military action in the South American country, but the efforts have lacked enough GOP support.",
      "Two Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the measure, which narrowly failed in a 215 to 215 vote.",
      "Republicans had to hold the 2-minute vote open for more than 20 minutes until Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas arrived to cast the tie-breaking vote, which defeated the measure. The delay in closing the vote caused an outcry from Democrats.",
      "\"Close the vote!\" Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York yelled as it was on the brink of passage without Hunt's vote. \"This is serious s***!\"",
      "The vote comes a week after the White House peeled off GOP support for a similar measure in the Senate that also narrowly failed to advance. Two Senate Republicans who flipped their votes to help sink the resolution said Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave them assurances that the president would seek congressional authorization if the administration plans to put U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "The House resolution, introduced by Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, \"directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.\"",
      "Two prior attempts to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region fell short in December, before this month's U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The first measure from last month \u2014 with the broader focus of removing U.S. armed forces from \"hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere\" \u2014 had the support of two Republicans, while two Democrats voted against it. The second resolution focused on \"hostilities within or against Venezuela.\" Three Republicans voted in favor and one Democrat opposed it.",
      "McGovern's latest resolution had a similar outcome. Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska both backed it. The two also supported the previous unsuccessful efforts.",
      "Bacon pointed to a fake image shared by Mr. Trump earlier this week, showing the president, vice president and secretary of state planting an American flag on Greenland. The image included a sign that claimed Greenland as a U.S. territory as of 2026.",
      "\"When you ask me why I voted the way I did on the War Powers Resolution later this week\u2026 here's one reason,\" Bacon wrote.",
      "When the Senate's efforts to rein in future military action in Venezuela had short-lived momentum, Massie said he was hopeful that more Republicans in the House would change their stance. Days earlier, the U.S. had captured Maduro in an operation that came as a surprise to Congress. Mr. Trump then asserted the U.S. was running the country, worrying some Republicans who had previously defended the president's authority to carry out strikes on dozens of boats allegedly smuggling illicit drugs.",
      "Any GOP criticism of the strikes has mostly quieted as attention has shifted to Mr. Trump's crusade to acquire Greenland.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the final legislation needed to fund the government through September on Thursday, sending a package of bills to the Senate as lawmakers face a deadline to avoid a partial shutdown next week.",
      "In a 341 to 88 vote, 149 Democrats and 192 Republicans voted in favor of a three-bill package related to the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The chamber also voted 220 to 207 to approve a separate measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The funding bills now head to the Senate for approval. They are expected to be packaged together with two other measures that passed in the lower chamber last week. That should speed up passage in the Senate, but the chamber will still have to work quickly, with just days to go before a Jan. 30 deadline. A brewing winter storm is also threatening to upend senators' plans to return to Washington early next week.",
      "After weeks of working to craft individual funding bills following the longest shutdown in history last year, House and Senate appropriators released the text of the final four pieces of legislation earlier this week. GOP leaders faced hurdles heading into Thursday, with multiple factions looking to use leverage to extract concessions in the final funding fight until September. A procedural vote was on the brink of failing before leaders wrangled the votes needed to move forward.",
      "The DHS appropriations bill was taken up separately after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.",
      "Top Democratic appropriators acknowledged that the DHS funding didn't go as far as some in their party had hoped. But they pointed to several concessions they secured, including new restrictions on DHS' ability to allocate funds if it does not comply with reporting requirements, new training benchmarks for officers and $20 million for body cameras for immigration enforcement agents.",
      "Democratic leaders said they would oppose it anyway. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said at a news conference that \"ICE is totally out of control, using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families.\"",
      "\"The American people deserve an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that conducts itself in a manner consistent with every other law enforcement agency in the country,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The measure ultimately picked up enough support for passage, with moderate Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged lawmakers to \"listen to the common-sense reasonable Democrats who helped to put these bills together.\"",
      "The speaker touted the funding bills more broadly, saying they would \"fund the Trump agenda and Republican efforts to restore peace through strength, to defend our borders and to deport criminal illegal aliens, to rebuild America's infrastructure and to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Republican leaders have pushed for a return to regular order in the appropriations process, pursuing the passage of all 12 funding bills rather than last-minute \"omnibus\" packages that have become commonplace in recent years. Johnson celebrated the appropriations work on Wednesday, saying there were many people who claimed \"that this could not be done, that a regular appropriations process is a thing of the past.\"",
      "\"Critics said our margins were too slim to bring it back, to rebuild that muscle memory that I committed to when I became speaker,\" Johnson said. \"They said we had too many bills left to pass and too many disagreements left to reconcile. But I'm happy to report that all of those prognostications were flat wrong, and we've gotten it done.\"",
      "In a surprise move on Thursday, the House also approved an amendment that would repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge. The move effectively jams the upper chamber by including the repeal in the funding package without the necessary time to reverse course, giving the Senate no option but to approve it.",

It claims JPMorgan Chase urged other financial institutions \"to not carry on business relationships,\" with them, forcing the Trumps and their businesses to accept a \"limited menu of options and less advantageous terms\" at other banks.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said the suit is meritless.",
      "\"While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,\" a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. \"We respect the president's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves \u2014 that's what courts are for.\"",
      "\"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons,\" the bank added. \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking sector.\"",
      "The suit was filed the same day the president left the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Dimon also spoke.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the threat of a lawsuit over the weekend. On Saturday, he said in a post on Truth Social, \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"",
      "Debanking has been a focus for the administration for months. In August, the president signed an executive order that alleged that \"financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals' and businesses' access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\" It also directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate the matter.",
      "The OCC's preliminary report, issued in December, said it had found early evidence that nine of the biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 had improperly refused to do business with a range of industries. The six-page report did not identify clients who had been debanked or the institutions alleged to have engaged in the practice.",
      "\"While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy,\" the comptroller of the currency said in a statement. \"The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House approved an amendment to a must-pass funding package Thursday that would repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge.",
      "In a unanimous vote, the House approved an amendment to the rule that governs the package of funding bills, which the lower chamber is expected to vote on later Thursday ahead of a deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "The Senate included the provision in a legislative package to bring an end to the government shutdown in November. It requires service providers to notify senators if their phone records or other data are seized or subpoenaed. Senators are entitled to $500,000 for each violation, and the law also applies retroactively to 2022 \u2014 allowing the senators whose phone records were seized during special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the 2020 election to sue the federal government.",
      "Lawmakers in the House have expressed frustration over the provision for months, and the House unanimously passed a bill later in November to roll it back. But Senate GOP leaders have expressed little willingness to do away with the provision.",
      "When one Democratic senator sought unanimous consent to approve the House-passed measure to repeal the provision in November, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, objected. Graham is one of the senators whose phone records were subpoenaed.

      "With the surprise amendment vote on Thursday, lawmakers in the House are effectively jamming the Senate by including the repeal of the controversial provision in a spending package that the House is expected to pass and send over to the upper chamber.

    "summary": "President Trump's plan for a missile defense system, which he's called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" could include an installation in Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said he wants to create a national missile system, which he's called the \"Golden Dome for America,\"\u00a0to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But the plans are far from coming to fruition, and it would come with a steep price. Already though, China has\u00a0criticized the plan as a threat that it says would increase the risks of militarizing space, and fuel a global arms race.",
      "The president said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "In January 2026, Mr. Trump said a framework agreement he'd reached\u00a0with America's NATO allies to defuse a standoff over his demands for the U.S. to take control of Greenland would include \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome being situated on the vast Arctic island.",
      "Greenland is in a crucial location for U.S. defense, as any attack by America's biggest adversaries, be it with missiles, drones or ships, could be deployed across the Arctic, which is the shortest path from Asia to the U.S. East Coast.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how would it work?",
      "The Golden Dome would be a multilayered defense system that the president has said will include \"next-generation technologies\" deployed on \"land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his second term ends.",
      "The concept includes capabilities that would defend against missiles by detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse, and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described one layer of defenses that would track threats, and then two other layers: \"The first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"The time to intercept a missile is when it launches,\" retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor and former commander of the U.S. Central Command, told CBS News. He said that early in a missile's flight, it is on \"a highly predictable\" path, can't maneuver and can't deploy systems to spoof radars, making that the ideal time to disable it.",
      "\"And to do that, you really have to go into space. You have to have a space-based system to do that,\" McKenzie said. \"That's very possible. We've looked at this at different times.\"",
      "McKenzie said he hoped \"that's where our thinking and our science is going to take us.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview. \"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time.\"",
      "Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, told CBS News' Margaret Brennan\u00a0in August 2025 that his state has long been home to key pieces of America's national missile defense infrastructure, and that he was working with the Pentagon on the development of plans for the Golden Dome.",
      "\"We have new threats. We have hypersonics, we have drones. We have, heck, even we've seen it here in Alaska, spy balloons. What we need to do is upgrade the system with what's called a layered defense, not just the ground based system here,\" Sullivan said. \"You work it more with different systems, Aegis Ashore, THADD, and then including space-based systems \u2014 both for tracking and intercepting \u2014 and you do that with the open architecture in terms of software to integrate those systems.\"",
      "How much will the Golden Dome cost?",
      "The initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "\"The cost is certainly a daunting thing,\" McKenzie said. \"But on the other hand, the ability to defend the United States against a nuclear attack, not necessarily a massive Russian attack, but, you know, an attack from North Korea, an attack from Iran, a potential attack from a country like Pakistan, who's working to develop an ICBM. Those are all things that I think are feasible, and I think certainly are worth the cost that would be necessary to work the system.\"",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X that it was ready to support the dome mission, described it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company said.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators at a hearing in May 2025. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's\u00a0joint address\u00a0to Congress in March 2025, when he asked for funding for it.",
      "\"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too,\" he said.",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome\u00a0defense system, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "China's foreign ministry has called on the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" a ministry spokesperson said last year. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the Golden Dome plan, \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "\"It's kind of humorous that the Chinese would talk about militarizing space, since I would guess they've done more work on militarizing space than any other nation in the world,\" McKenzie said. \"I would argue this is an inherently defensive system, and it's designed to protect the United States from attack.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has rapidly developed its missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a joint statement in 2025 that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative was \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia.",
      "\"Could [the Golden Dome] launch another spiral of offensive developments to try to break through?\" McKenzie said. \"Certainly that's possible. And I recognize that's a possibility. Having said that, I still think it's an objective worth pursuing.\"",

      "The Justice Department is also in talks with the Pentagon to send some of its forensic auditors to Minnesota to assist with fraud investigations and potentially to testify in court, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The Pentagon request for attorneys seen by CBS News describes the short-term volunteer assignment, which would begin in March, as a detail to serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in the state. It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",
      "The city of Minneapolis is also the center of the largest deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in its history, who are there both for the fraud probe and to carry out immigration enforcement as part of what the Trump administration has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "The effort has the support of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the source added.",
      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",
      "The additional resources from the Pentagon will help to augment the other efforts by the Justice Department to temporarily detail prosecutors from other neighboring districts in the coming weeks, including from parts of Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Wisconsin and North and South Dakota, the source added.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota recently lost about 10 prosecutors, some of whom handled criminal cases including the high-profile \"Feeding Our Futures\" fraud investigation. Career prosecutors who remain have largely been sidelined, sources tell CBS.",
      "The Pentagon referred questions to the Justice Department. On Thursday, a Justice Department spokesperson said in statement the department\u00a0\"is laser focused on rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, and has already charged dozens of defendants from Minnesota who've defrauded the American people.\"",
      "\"Ensuring fraudsters, including refugees laundering American tax dollars, are held accountable is a top priority for this Administration, and this whole of government approach will continue until justice is served,\" the statement continued.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" in diesel-powered vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Wednesday ordered federal prosecutors to stop pursuing criminal charges and drop all pending cases targeting the sale of illicit \"defeat devices\" that are used to tamper with air pollution control systems in diesel-powered vehicles, according to a memo seen by CBS News.",
      "The edict, issued by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, marks the first time that the Justice Department has formally taken steps to scale back environmental criminal enforcement since President Trump took office in January 2025.",
      "In the memo, Blanche wrote that he was taking this step \"to ensure consistent and fair prosecution under the law, as well as to ensure the best use of Department resources,\" according to a copy reviewed by CBS News.",
      "Although the Trump administration took drastic steps throughout 2025 to roll back environmental rules targeting greenhouse gas emissions, many of those actions focused on regulations or civil enforcement, as opposed to criminal environmental enforcement.",
      "In justifying the decision, Blanche cited a new and untested legal theory that runs counter to conclusions reached by both career federal prosecutors and attorneys for the Environmental Protection Agency, according to internal government records reviewed by CBS and multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The theory posits that the violations could not be prosecuted as crimes under the Clean Air Act, and could only be pursued as civil offenses.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson, when asked for comment on the memo, pointed to a social media post made late Wednesday afternoon. It said the department was \"exercising its enforcement discretion to no longer pursue\" criminal charges of the Clean Air Act based on allegations of tampering with the software associated with emissions control devices.",
      "Blanche's memo comes several months after Mr. Trump in November pardoned Troy Lake, a Wyoming-based diesel mechanic who served seven months in federal prison for conspiring to violate the Clean Air Act by disabling emissions-control devices inside diesel trucks.",
      "The pardon came at the urging of Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who alleged that the Lake case represented an example of a \"weaponized\" prosecution by the Biden administration. She did not cite any evidence for her claim.",
      "Lummis has also championed legislation that would strip the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate air pollution rules for vehicle emissions and ban the federal government from forcing auto manufacturers to install emissions control systems.",
      "Blanche's order could potentially impact more than a dozen pending criminal cases across the country targeting companies and individuals who allegedly sold after-market emissions defeat devices, as well as more than 20 ongoing investigations, according to two sources familiar with the matter and court filings.",
      "Several of the pending criminal cases, including two in different districts in Pennsylvania, were indicted in 2025 during the first year of Mr. Trump's second term in office, court filings show.",
      "The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate air pollution levels generated by vehicles.",
      "In order to comply with those rules, auto manufacturers are required to install emissions control systems to reduce the level of pollutants, such as including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.",
      "It is unlawful to tamper with those systems, but there's a robust black market for after-market emissions defeat devices because deleting or tuning them can help boost horsepower and improve mileage.",
      "Historically, the EPA and the Justice Department have focused on defeat devices used in diesel vehicles because of the greater pollutant levels they cause.",
      "A 2020 study by the EPA found that in the last decade, emissions controls had been removed from some 550,000 diesel pickup trucks, leading to the emission of 570,000 tons of excess oxides of nitrogen.",
      "The Justice Department's most high-profile Clean Air Act criminal case related to emissions cheating was Volkswagen.",
      "In 2017, at the tail end of the Obama administration, the company pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it sought to deceive the EPA and state regulators in California by installing defeat devices into its emissions control systems in a failed attempt to cheat emissions tests.",
      "As part of the plea, Volkswagen paid a $2.8 billion criminal fine, and also agreed to pay another $1.5 billion in separate civil resolutions.",
      "After Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his first term, the EPA decided to start scrutinizing after-market emissions defeat devices and went on to make it an investigative priority.",
      "Untested defense bar arguments",
      "The push to kill all of the pending defeat device cases was championed by Adam Gustafson, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division who previously worked for Boeing and at the EPA, according to two of those sources and government records seen by CBS News.",
      "He has not specialized in the practice of criminal environmental law.",
      "Although Gustafson has previously signed off on at least some of the pending indictments involving after-market defeat devices, a new and novel defense bar argument that surfaced over the summer later changed his mind, the sources said.",
      "In July, an autobody shop owner named Tracy Coiteux appealed her criminal conviction under the Clean Air Act for tampering with emissions control systems before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Her attorneys put forth a legal theory alleging that she cannot be held criminally liable because the software associated with emission controls, known as \"onboard diagnostic systems,\" is not \"required to be maintained\" under the Clean Air Act.",
      "For this reason, they claimed that such an offense can only be charged as a civil violation, not a criminal one.",
      "Coiteux's attorneys, Alex Bourelly and Andrew George, told CBS in a statement they are \"thrilled for Tracy and grateful that the government has agreed her case should be dismissed.\" The Justice Department\u00a0filed a notice Thursday with the court indicating it intends to dismiss the case.",
      "Andy Mergen, a longtime former appellate lawyer in the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, said Blanche's memo to prosecutors is \"essentially a confession of error,\" which complicates matters in the Ninth Circuit litigation because it means the department is now deciding that it was wrong to bring a case on which it ultimately prevailed at trial.",
      "\"Confession of error is an important responsibility of the Justice Department, and the process is intended to be rigorous. The decision is understood to be in the domain of the solicitor general,\" he told CBS.",
      "Making such a determination, he said, entails carefully weighing a variety of factors, including the reasonableness of the position, and the credibility of the U.S. government.",
      "\"Environmental crimes are challenging and deserve attention, but the process used here makes me question whether the rigorous standards that govern a confession of error were applied here,\" Mergen said.",
      "Lawyers for John and Josh Owens, a father and son who own a diesel truck products business in Washington state, have since raised similar arguments in an effort to get the charges against their clients dismissed.",
      "\"This is the right decision: the Clean Air Act was never intended to be used in this way to impose criminal liability,\" said Bill McSwain of Duane Morris. These prosecutions targeting hardworking American tradesmen were wrongheaded from the start. Our clients are pleased to put this misguided, weaponized case behind them.\" McSwain, who is counsel to Josh Owens and Diesel Truck Products, previously served as U.S. attorney in Philadelphia during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "An internal EPA memo reviewed by CBS News shows that career attorneys disagree with the arguments made by defense lawyers in the 9th Circuit case. The memo argues that there are \"multiple respects\" in which diesel truck emissions software systems are \"required to be maintained\" under the law, and therefore tampering with them can be a crime.",
      "\"When Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, legislators sought to ensure that regulated motor vehicles/engines would meet applicable emission standards not only at the time of manufacture and initial sale, but thereafter in everyday use,\" the memo says.",
      "Although the 9th Circuit has not yet ruled on the matter, the legal theory resonated with Gustafson, who started raising questions about the pending cases, one of the sources said.",
      "After Lake was pardoned in November, the topic picked up steam and Gustafson began reaching out to prosecutors with pending cases and asked them to justify the criminal charges, two of the sources said.",
      "Because some of the pending cases are being handled by other U.S. attorney's offices and not by the office that Gustafson leads, he could not order all of the cases to be dismissed on his own.",
      "He sought support from Blanche's office, and also from the EPA's incoming head of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Jeffrey Hall, whom the Senate confirmed on Dec. 18, three sources said.",
      "Shortly before Blanche issued his memo, Hall told staff that he had \"carefully examined EPA enforcement for tampering with onboard diagnostic units\" and that after speaking with the Justice Department, he was directing EPA to \"no longer investigate or pursue criminal cases\" related to the tampering of emissions control software.",

      "President Trump could start flying in a plane donated by Qatar as early as this summer, as the U.S. Air Force confirms it will deliver the refurbished jumbo jet for use as Air Force One within months.",
      "\"The Air Force remains committed to expediting delivery of the VC-25 bridge aircraft in support of the Presidential airlift mission, with an anticipated delivery no later than summer 2026,\" an Air Force spokesperson said Wednesday, confirming a report by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The royal family of Qatar donated the Boeing 747-style plane for Mr. Trump's use last spring. The plane could not enter service immediately, though, as the Pentagon needed to retrofit it to serve as Air Force One. It also needed to be checked for security and spying devices before it was accepted, a source told CBS News at the time.",
      "The donated plane could take the place of two 35-year-old jets that currently serve as Air Force One. Mr. Trump has long pushed to replace the aging planes, but a project to replace them has faced delays, with delivery of two new planes currently set for 2027 and 2028.",
      "The existing planes showed their age late Tuesday, when Air Force One turned around less than an hour after taking off for Switzerland due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" The president then switched to a smaller plane before flying across the Atlantic for the World Economic Forum.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joked at one point during the ordeal that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better.\"",
      "The donation has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and watchdog groups, who have argued it poses ethics concerns for the president to accept a gift worth hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign country. Some critics have also questioned the cost of retrofitting the donated plane.",
      "\"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund, a group run by an Obama-era ethics official that requested an investigation into the gift last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has brushed off the concerns and defended his decision to accept the gift.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said last year. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",

      "U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new framework could include a new NATO \"Arctic Sentry\" security partnership.",
      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "Mr. Trump said\u00a0he sent an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said his country was still consulting with Russia's \"strategic partners\" before making a decision on whether to commit to the peace board, The Associated Press reported Thursday.",

      "\"This announcement is incorrect,\" Maxime Pr\u00e9vot, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, said. \"We wish for a common and coordinated European response. As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal.\"",
      "Israel and Canada were among the nations that previously announced they were accepting Mr. Trump's invitation to join, although they did not appear on the White House list on Thursday.",

      "Britain declined to sign onto the peace board for now, U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.",
      "\"We won't be one of the signatories today,\" Cooper told the BBC Thursday. \"Because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"",
      "Norway and Sweden said Wednesday they were holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News earlier this week that France intended to decline due to concerns that the Board of Peace charter goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises major issues, particularly regarding respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said Monday night he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne if they did not join the Board of Peace. The White House has not responded to several inquiries as to whether or not the president was joking.",

      "Is the Board of Peace intended to replace the United Nations?",
      "President Trump said\u00a0Thursday that the board would be committed to ensuring Gaza's demilitarization, and hinted at wider ambitions for the group going forward.",
      "He said the board would work \"coupled with the United Nations\" to create a \"safer future for the world, unfolding before your eyes,\" adding that the board would help to \"end decades of suffering.\"",
      "The president also said the board can do \"pretty much whatever we want to do\" once it is formed, and that \"we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said the Board of Peace \"might\" replace the world's primary global body.",
      "\"I mean, the U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I'm a big fan of the U.N. potential. But it has never lived up to its potential,\" he said in a more than 90-minute press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Jan. 20.",

      "The official told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza and said \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the board's mandate. There will be no \"exorbitant salaries\" or \"administrative bloat,\" the official said.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:56:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Geraldo Lunas Campos died following an altercation with guards at Camp East Montana, a tent facility on the grounds of Fort Bliss.",
    "story": [
      "A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.",
      "Geraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.",
      "But a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.",
      "His death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.",
      "The autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.",
      "The report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos \"become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.\" It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages \u2014 tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury \u2014 in the eyelids and skin of the neck.",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for the AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.",
      "He said the contusions on Lunas Campos' body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.",
      "The autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.",
      "ICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.",
      "\"While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,\" the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. \"Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.\"",
      "Lunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.",
      "Last Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.",
      "\"Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,\" she said. \"During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.\"",
      "After the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was \"a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.\"",
      "New York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state's sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.",
      "\"ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.",
      "A final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials' legal jurisdiction to investigate.",
      "Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.",
      "ICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.",
      "In addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.",
      "On Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a \"presumed suicide.\" The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.",
      "Unlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso.",
      "The government awarded Acquisition Logistics a $1.24 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, which opened in August of last year.",
      "A house in suburban Richmond, Virginia, is listed as the headquarters of Acquisition Logistics and has no public record of running a detention facility before this one.",
      "In an interview with CBS News in September, Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who had been inside the facility twice at that point, described it as a \"giant tent city.\"",
      "\"There are hard floors. There are walls that go up, probably about three-quarters of the way to the ceiling,\" she said at the time.",
      "Escobar said she saw about 1,500 people inside during one visit.",
      "McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.",
      "Escobar on Wednesday called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.",
      "\"DHS must preserve all evidence \u2014 including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,\" Escobar said Wednesday. \"I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.\"",

    "story": [
      "A newly disclosed whistleblower complaint indicates that Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorized its officers to enter homes without judicial warrants in the cases of people with deportation orders, a sweeping reversal of longstanding rules.",
      "Historically, ICE has told its officers that they could not rely on administrative immigration warrants \u2014 signed by officials at the agency, not judges \u2014 to enter people's homes, due to constitutional protections against warrantless searches.",
      "But a May 2025 memo disclosed Wednesday by two U.S. government whistleblowers gave ICE officers permission to use those administrative immigration warrants to enter residences by force to arrest unauthorized immigrants who had been ordered deported by an immigration judge or court.",
      "The directive, signed by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, \"Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.\"",
      "Lyons' memo empowered ICE officers to use the \"necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien's residence\" if the targets of operations do not allow them inside.",
      "Before any forced entry, ICE officers should knock on the residence's door and identify themselves. The memo also directed officers to conduct such operations targeting those with deportation orders after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m.",
      "Asked about the previously undisclosed directive, which was reported by The Associated Press earlier Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said those affected by the memo had been given \"full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,\" McLaughlin argued in her statement. \"For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.\"",
      "The directive is likely to trigger legal challenges, as the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been long interpreted to largely prohibit searches and seizures without judicial warrants, including in the immigration context.",
      "According to the whistleblower complaint, which was shared with Congress, Lyons' memo has not been shared widely within the agency but has been used to train ICE officers.",
      "\"The whistleblowers assert that this is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment,\" said Whistleblower Aid, the nonprofit representing the whistleblowers. \"This disclosure is particularly timely and relevant given recent news reports of ICE officers breaking into homes, including those of U.S. citizens, without a judicial warrant and forcibly removing the residents.\"",

      "A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good.\" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.",
      "The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors, David Easterwood, also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.",
      "Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations \"by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.\"",
      "\"A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!\" she said on social media.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying she's \"been in constant communication with (Dhillo)\u00a0 today over these events which (the Justice Department) is investigating at my direction. Any violation of federal law will be prosecuted.\"",
      "Bondi added that she \"just spoke to the Pastor in Minnesota whose church was targeted. Attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law. If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.\"",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.",
      "\"When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,\" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. \"If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.\"",
      "The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.",
      "Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.",
      "Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.",
      "In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents \"knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.\"",
      "\"Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,\" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. \"They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.\"",
      "Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.",
      "\"If you got a head - a leader in a church - that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?\" Cullars-Doty said. \"We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.\"",

      "The 5.7-million-pound rocket, carried by an upgraded Apollo-era crawler-transporter tipping the scales at some six million pounds, began the trip to pad 39B just after 7 a.m. local time, creeping out of NASA's cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at a top speed of just under 1 mile per hour.",

It has a little more than half the thrust of SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but after a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022 \u2014 Artemis I \u2014 NASA deemed it safe enough to put astronauts aboard.",
      "The SpaceX rocket is still in the test phase, and it's not known when it might make its first flight with people on board.",
      "The Artemis II crew plans to blast off in early February to test drive their Orion crew capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space on a flight around the moon that will carry them farther from Earth than any astronauts have ever ventured. In the process, they will get a chance to observe the far side of the moon in some detail.",
      "\"I think one of the most magical things for me in this experience is when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent (moon) in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,\" Wiseman told reporters during the SLS rollout. \"It was a waning crescent here, so it's a waxing gibbous on the far side.\"",
      "He added: \"And you just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look, and seeing Earth rise, those sorts of things, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective is what I think when I look out (at the moon) right now.\"",
      "The trip to launch pad 39B took about eight hours, kicking off a busy few weeks of tightly scripted tests and checkouts before a critical fueling test around Feb. 2 when nearly 800,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen will be pumped aboard for a \"wet\" dress rehearsal countdown.",
      "\"One of the first things that happens after we get to the pad, we get  connected ... all the validations, getting tied back to the firing  room, getting ready to power up the individual elements,\" said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"We will get into our crew module  work (and) we're going to power everything up.\"",
      "Blackwell-Thompson added: \"We have  incrementally tested all of this offline or in the integrated  environment of the VAB and now it's just getting out to the pad and  testing those pad interfaces. ... Wet dress is the big test at the pad.  That's the one to keep an eye on, I guess, that's the driver to launch.\"",
      "The maiden flight of the SLS rocket in 2022 was delayed multiple times by propellant loading problems and persistent hydrogen leaks. For the rocket's second flight, NASA and its contractor team have implemented multiple upgrades and procedural changes to minimize or eliminate any such problems the second time around.",
      "\"Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,\" said Blackwell-Thompson. \"And the things that we learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.\"",
      "Because of the relative positions of the Earth and moon, along with the trajectory NASA plans to use for Artemis II, the agency only has five launch opportunities in February: Feb. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because rollout came a few days later than planned, pushing the fueling test into early February, it would appear only the final three opportunities are still available.",
      "But a leak-free fueling test, in the absence of any other major issues, will clear the way for a launch attempt on one or two of those days. If not, the next set of launch windows opens in March.",
      "A wild card in the mission planning is the launch of a fresh crew to the International Space Station to replace four crew members who returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue affecting one of the astronauts. That launch originally was scheduled for Feb. 15, but NASA managers are looking into moving it up by several days to minimize the gap between crews.",
      "NASA flight controllers want to avoid flying two piloted spacecraft at the same time. If the space station crew replacement flight stays on track, or if problems are found during the SLS fueling test, agency managers might be forced to delay the Artemis II launch to the next set of opportunities in March.",
      "But Isaacman is keeping NASA's options open.",
      "\"We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,\" he said. \"But look, that's our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared. We'll take it.\"",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "Jackson, Miss. \u2014 Animal advocates are racing to rescue more than 200 dogs from a rural Mississippi property before a massive winter storm is forecast to hit Friday.",
      "Paws of War, a New York-based nonprofit that rescues animals and places them with veterans and first responders, is helping to lead the charge.",

      "He described it as a \"house of horrors,\" with the skeletal remains of dogs decomposing in the yard and feces everywhere. The dogs, he said, were living both inside and outside of a home.",
      "\"It's rewarding seeing them come off the property for the first time, knowing that they will ultimately wind up on someone's couch. But to think that they suffered up there for all these years in silence,\" Misseri said before trailing off.",
      "Misseri said the Lee County Sheriff's Office asked Paws of War for help with rehoming the animals. As of Thursday evening, nine shelters had taken about 60 dogs. Paws of War has sent several trucks to the property to bring 45 dogs back to New York.",
      "Thirteen of the dogs are now at the Northshore Humane Society in Covington, Louisiana. The humane society's team traversed more than 300 miles to the Tupelo, Mississippi, area on Wednesday for what they dubbed \"Operation: Tupelo Tails.\"",
      "\"A lot of these dogs have scars on their faces, which is evidence that they were probably sparring with the other dogs for food,\" said Scott Bernier, Northshore Humane Society's CEO. \"So it's a bad condition. Not something we ever like to see.\"",
      "Scout Cannizzaro, a veterinary technician at the Northshore Humane Society, said some of the dogs had upper respiratory infections and skin conditions. Bernier said he also expects some of the dogs to have heartworm.",
      "The humane society is now trying to get as many dogs as possible into foster homes because their building is old and doesn't retain heat well. However, Bernier said any animals left at the shelter when the storm hits will be warm and safe.",
      "The Paws of War was working overnight trying to find shelters for the remaining dogs before the storm hits, Misseri said. His team is also still searching the area for skittish dogs that ran away, and he said the number of dogs needing to be rescued could reach 300.",
      "He said no matter what happens, he will not allow the dogs to be left outside during the storm. He is asking other shelters to come forward and take some of the dogs.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Heavy snow, ice and brutal cold are expected to make this winter storm a potentially life-threatening weather event for 35 states.",
    "story": [
      "More than 200 million people across the United States are bracing for the arrival of a major\u00a0winter storm\u00a0that is set to take hold over the weekend. About 175 million are under winter weather or extreme cold alerts, as the system threatens to bring a mix of frigid conditions to a 2,000-mile expanse of the country. Meanwhile, roughly 160 million are under alerts for snow, sleet and freezing rain, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The storm is shaping up to begin in the southern Plains on Friday before moving across the South and into the East Coast. Heavy snow, ice and brutal cold are expected to make the storm a potentially life-threatening weather event for a huge portion of the country \u2014 35 states.",
      "From the Rockies to the East Coast, forecasts show about two-thirds of the U.S. could be affected by what will likely be the largest winter storm in at least five years. As the system pushes east, temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the southern Plains and mid-Atlantic regions, with people around Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, North Carolina, potentially experiencing those areas' coldest stretches since 2018.",
      "Maps show what to expect from the winter storm",
      "A low-pressure system is forecast to develop in the Southwest and interact with incoming Gulf moisture and Arctic cold air. Forecast models indicate it will begin dropping precipitation on Friday in the southern Plains.",
      "The system is expected to slowly move eastward, bringing snow and accumulating ice. Forecast models continue to change as the event nears, but it is set to impact broad swaths of the U.S., from Arizona to Maine, said National Weather Service meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso, of the agency's Weather Prediction Center.",
      "Heavy snow is expected over a wide band of the country, with a foot or more potentially headed for parts of the Texas Panhandle and the Ozarks, Otto and Fracasso told CBS News. The highest snowfall totals \u2014 possibly up to 2 feet \u2014 could accumulate in the central Appalachians and into the Northeast, they said.",
      "According to CBS New York meteorologist Scott Padgett, some parts of New York could see anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of snow.",
      "Meanwhile, the polar vortex that is usually situated over the North Pole is forecast to dip down into the eastern half of the U.S. starting Thursday and lasting through the first half of next week.",
      "This will make temperatures drop well below average for this time of year and even bring record-breaking temperatures to some locations. Frostbite can occur in as little as 5 to 10 minutes if exposed to this dangerous cold. Wind chill temperatures are forecast to feel like 40 to 50 degrees below zero in some places across the northern U.S.",
      "Ice is expected to accumulate along the southern side of the storm's track, but considering its slow movement, the amount of accumulation is expected to be between two-tenths of an inch to up to half an inch. Impacts of this magnitude can bring down power lines. With the harsh cold in place, power outages could leave people freezing without indoor heat in some communities.",
      "Parts of northeastern Texas, northern Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee will likely feel the most substantial effects of the ice, said Otto and Fracasso. They noted that icy conditions are also expected to have significant impacts on a block of the eastern U.S., from northern Georgia into the Carolinas.",
      "Possible snowfall amounts are still in flux for individual locations as forecast models continue to come together. But up to 5 or 10 inches is already expected across the southern Plains as the system takes shape over the region on Friday into Saturday.",
      "As this system moves east, snowfall amounts will vary depending on location.",
      "Winter storm may impact travel plans",
      "Travel is likely to be disrupted by weather conditions on roadways and at the airports. Some airports in the South do not have deicing equipment for aircraft to take off safely, possibly leading to widespread cancellations and delays over the weekend.",
      "Some airports that could see issues are Dallas Fort Worth International Airport; Will Rogers International Airport in Oklahoma City; Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis International and Nashville International airports in Tennessee, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.",
      "Major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers, and many carriers are issuing travel alerts and allowing customers to change their plans without penalty as of Thursday.",
      "In a news release Thursday evening, Delta Air Lines said it flight cancelations would be \"necessary\" at \"select airports in North Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee.\" It did not detail how many flights were expected to be impacted.",
      "The roads could also become very difficult to navigate, if not impossible, with slick conditions on major interstates such as I-10, I-20, I-30, I-35, I-40, I-44, I-49 and I-55.",
      "Travel on the roads is highly discouraged through the weekend, but if it's absolutely necessary, people are advised to drive with caution.",
      "\"Treacherous and hazardous driving conditions are likely due to both the ice and snow accumulations. In some areas, travel will become nearly impossible during the peak of the storm,\" said Otto and Fracasso. \"The extreme cold that follows the storm will prolong the potential impacts, with many areas not getting above freezing for much of next week.\"",
      "Officials urge drivers to consider taking a winter storm kit with them, including such items as booster cables, a flashlight, a shovel, blankets and extra clothing as well as water, a first aid kit and anything else that would help survive being stranded.",
      "Preparations underway",
      "In Texas, heavy ice could weigh down power lines and trigger widespread outages. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0said in a news conference Thursday that Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state's power grid, \"has never been stronger, never been more prepared, and is fully capable of handling this winter storm.\"",
      "Texas transportation agencies are working overtime to prepare, with officials hoping to avoid a repeat of the widespread outages caused by a paralyzing ice storm in 2021 that led to the deaths of more than 200 people.",
      "Stores throughout the South were packed with people loading up on supplies such as generators, flashlights and batteries. In the Fort Worth area, some shoppers were finding essential items out of stock.",
      "Meanwhile, staffers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago were preparing for a surge in cold-related trauma, with emergency room physicians on standby.",
      "\"We'll see a lot of patients for exposure, frostnip, frostbite, maybe some hypothermia,\" Dr. Scott Heinrich, a Rush ER physician, told CBS News. \"We see our vulnerable populations, those that are housing insecure, maybe our older adults without heat.\"",
      "Reasons for forecast uncertainty",
      "After weather prediction models showed considerable variation in their winter storm forecasts earlier in the week, the uncertainty is decreasing as the storm's arrival nears.",
      "Those variations seen earlier in the week were not unusual, said Otto and Fracasso, adding that there can be significant differences \"among forecast models 3-4 days ahead of the start of a storm.\"",
      "Predicting winter storms can carry an additional layer of uncertainty, as freezing temperatures create another variable in the forecast.",
      "\"For winter storms, the uncertainty is compounded due to the uncertainty in total precipitation amount in addition to the type of precipitation that may fall,\" said Otto and Fracasso. When the type of precipitation is snow, very slight atmospheric changes like temperature variations of just one or two degrees can alter the forecast dramatically, they added.",
      "Ash-har  Quraishi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jason  Allen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:17:36 -0500",
    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, China and the U.S. have signed off on a deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms,keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "TikTok confirmed Thursday that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a statement late Thursday. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS News. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",

    "story": [
      "A Minnesota federal magistrate judge refused to sign a complaint charging independent journalist Don Lemon in connection with a protest inside a church in St. Paul on Sunday, multiple sources familiar with the proceedings told CBS News.",
      "\"The attorney general is enraged at the magistrate's decision,\" said a source familiar with the matter. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been in Minnesota for two days, as the Justice Department has sought to surge prosecutorial and law enforcement resources there.",
      "A different source stressed that the process is not over, and the Justice Department could find other avenues to charge Lemon.",
      "The magistrate judge who declined to approve charges for Lemon was Douglas Micko, sources told CBS News. Micko previously worked as a federal public defender.",
      "Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday that the magistrate's actions \"confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter.\"",
      "\"Should the Department of Justice continue with a stunning and troubling effort to silence and punish a journalist for doing his job, Don will call out their latest attack on the rule of law and fight any charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said.",
      "The government had hoped to charge Lemon along with a raft of other people who participated in the protest at the church.",
      "On Thursday morning, Bondi announced two arrests connected to the church protests \u2014 Chauntyll Louisa Allen, who serves on the St. Paul School Board, and civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. Bondi alleged that Armstrong was involved in organizing the protest. Bondi later said a third person, William Kelly, was arrested.",
      "Allen and Armstrong both appeared in federal court in St. Paul on Thursday, where they were each charged with violating a civil rights law that prohibits two or more people from conspiring to interfere with constitutionally protected rights, like the free practice of religion.",
      "Micko, who presided over Thursday's hearing, declined to approve a second criminal charge against the two local activists that accused them of violating a provision in the FACE Act which makes it a crime to use force, threats, or physical obstruction to injure, intimidate, or interfere with a person who is exercising their First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of worship.",
      "In a copy of an arrest warrant against Allen obtained by CBS News, the second charge was physically crossed off, with \"NO PROBABLE CAUSE\" written in the margin. An attorney for Armstrong said that the magistrate judge also crossed off a charge on her arrest warrant.",

      "Tension was evident during Thursday's hearing to review the arrests. Just minutes after Micko began the hearing, federal prosecutors conceded they had yet to provide copies of the arrest warrants to the two women arrested and their attorneys.",
      "\"We can get them,\" Robert Keenan, an attorney in the Civil Rights Division, told the judge.",
      "Micko then ordered a recess and vowed not to proceed until that happened, prompting audible gasps and some cheers from those in attendance watching in overflow rooms.",
      "When proceedings restarted, the Justice Department's request for Armstrong and Allen to be detained was swiftly denied, as were their requests for detention hearings.",
      "Keenan argued that the allegations involved \"crimes of violence,\" but Micko shot back that he didn't see \"any threat or use of force.\"",
      "Ultimately, both Armstrong and Allen were ordered to be released on condition they remain in Minnesota, stay off the church's property and avoid contact with any witness or victim.",
      "But later Thursday, defense attorneys told CBS News that both Armstrong and Allen would not be released pending the Justice Department's plan to appeal and seek their detention.",
      "\"This is the due process for the prosecution that doesn't seem to happen to folks we try to get out of Whipple [Federal Building] or any other f***ing jail in this city,\" lamented attorney James Cook, who represents Allen.",
      "A judge is expected to make a ruling on the Justice Department's appeal on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors also asked that the criminal complaints remain sealed despite the very public nature of the case \u2014 a motion that was approved for 24 hours.",
      "The two federal prosecutors who appeared in the courtroom are not from Minnesota.",
      "Before joining the Civil Rights Division, Keenan previously worked as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where he argued that a local deputy sheriff convicted of civil rights violations should have his conviction on the felony counts struck and should not serve prison time. The efforts to strike the felony conviction led several prosecutors on the case to resign in protest.",
      "Most recently, he was dispatched to Louisville to handle the sentencing for a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights, where he asked the judge to impose a sentence of just one day.",

    "summary": "A historic preservation nonprofit is trying to block ongoing construction of Trump's new White House ballroom.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's claims that it has the proper authority to continue construction on the East Wing site that was demolished last year.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon heard arguments Thursday on a motion brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to block the ongoing construction of the East Wing until the Trump administration goes through the appropriate approval processes, which it alleges the Trump administration has ignored.",
      "Friday's arguments focused primarily on two issues: whether the president can unilaterally renovate the White House and whether he can do it with private funds that were transferred to an office under his authority, rather than with funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Tad Heuer, an attorney representing the Trust, argued the law requires express approval from Congress to execute a project as significant as the 90,000 square-foot East Wing renovation.",
      "Congress provides the White House with a modest annual budget for the \"repair, alteration, and improvement\" of the building. The administration contends this authority encompasses the East Wing overhaul.",
      "Leon responded that the Trump administration's view is a \"very expansive definition,\" later adding that \"there's been an end-run around this oversight from Congress.\"",
      "Leon pressed senior Justice Department official Yaakov Roth, on whether \"ripping down the East Wing\" is similar to previous White House renovations, like the tennis pavilion added by Mr. Trump in his first term, or the swimming pool added in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. Roth argued it was akin to those projects.",
      "\"Come on. Be serious,\" Leon snapped.",
      "The $400 million ballroom is being privately financed. Donations were collected by a nonprofit organization, turned over to the National Park Service and then funneled to the Executive Residence at the White House, which is overseen by Mr. Trump.",
      "Leon repeatedly called the financing arrangement a \"Rube Goldberg,\" referring to the cartoonist and inventor who made complex contraptions to perform simple tasks.",
      "Roth argued that Mr. Trump \"cares about this, so he wanted to keep it in house,\" referring to the planning and financing for the project, which includes the ballroom, and a new secure bunker underneath it.",
      "\"Every construction truck of concrete\" that is brought to the East Wing site for construction constitutes irreparable harm to the public, Heuer said, arguing that Mr. Trump should have gone to Congress with a proposal to allocate funding for the ballroom before beginning demolition, instead of relying on a collection of private and corporate funds for the renovations.",
      "\"The president didn't want $400 million of taxpayer money to be used for this,\" Roth said of the ballroom, which is expected to be completed during the summer of 2028.",
      "He called any alleged harms \"speculative\" and said that Leon should not stop the construction in the middle of the project, citing \"national security implications\" and the risk of flooding or damage to the intact parts of the White House that are adjacent to construction.",
      "In December, the Trust filed the first major lawsuit against Mr. Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, arguing no president is allowed to tear down parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\" The historic preservation group argued that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law.",
      "A week later, Leon denied a temporary restraining order sought by the Trust, finding that the group had not established enough irreparable harm to pause the construction outright, but the judge said construction crews cannot build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist.",
      "Leon said he will likely issue an opinion in February.",
      "Earlier Friday, the administration provided an informational presentation to the Commission of Fine Arts. CFA advises the federal government on matters of design in the nation's capital.",
      "The presentation, led by White House official Joshua Fisher and chief architect Shalom Baranes, was similar to their presentation before the National Capital Planning Commission earlier this month.",
      "Baranes said the ballroom itself is expected to be about 22,000 square feet (110x200 feet) with 40-foot ceilings. It is expected to hold 1,000 guests for a formal seated dinner. The total East Wing renovation is slated to cover an area of approximately 89,000 square feet over two floors.",
      "On the upper floor, the renovated area will include the ballroom, a lobby, bathrooms and corridor connecting it to the East Room.",
      "And on the lower floor, there will be an office suite for the first lady, kitchen space, a movie theater and a corridor connecting the area to the main residence.",
      "The east wall of the structure, which faces the Treasury Department, has been redesigned from the original renderings. It will feature eight floor-to-ceiling windows and eight columns above the main guest entry stairway.",
      "Baranes promised a digital 3D rendering of the design in the coming weeks. He briefly mentioned the potential for renovations to the West Wing colonnade. He said no design work has been started but some structural assessments are underway.",
      "Mr. Trump recently appointed five new members to the CFA including Rodney Mims Cook Jr. who was voted chairman Thursday.",
      "Cook asked several questions about the project but seemed generally favorable to the design. His main concern was the scale of the building, as viewed from the south side of the White House complex.",
      "\"It's immense,\" Cook said. Baranes said the building's footprint extends just about 300 feet into the South Lawn.",
      "James McCrery, the commission's vice chairman, recused himself from the ballroom portion of the meeting because he was the project's original architect.",
      "Thursday's presentation did not require a vote from the commission. The White House will make another presentation at next month's CFA meeting.",

    "story": [
      "The former superintendent of Iowa's largest school district pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court, admitting to falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen on a federal form and illegally possessing firearms.",
      "Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana in South America, had initially pleaded not guilty to both counts, which together carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and a trial was scheduled to begin in early March. Roberts affirmed Thursday that he's aware his guilty pleas could have an impact on his immigration case and that he could face immediate deportation after he serves his sentence.",
      "Roberts ascended as an exuberant and inspiring leader over a two-decade career in  urban education. For two years, he was superintendent of the Des Moines public school district, which serves 30,000 students.",
      "Just weeks into a new school year, Roberts was  detained by federal immigration officers. The Sept. 26 arrest stunned community members and drew national attention to his history of criminal charges and falsified credentials. He was placed on leave by the school board the following day and resigned from the position on Sept. 30.",
      "On Thursday, Roberts walked into the courtroom with his wrists and feet cuffed. He addressed U.S. Magistrate Judge Helen C. Adams cordially and simply as he acknowledged he understood his rights and the details of his plea agreement, which he had in front of him. Roberts put on eyeglasses to follow along.",
      "\"It is my signature, your honor,\" he said of the signed agreement, and later confirmed it was \"my decision\" to sign it.",
      "As part of Roberts' plea agreement, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Iowa agreed to not pursue additional charges against Roberts or others related to these counts, according to the filing. Prosecutors also agreed to recommend some leniency, but Roberts' sentence is ultimately up to U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger. That hearing is scheduled for May 29. Roberts will remain in custody while he awaits sentencing.",
      "Alfredo Parrish, one of Roberts' attorneys, told reporters after the hearing that Roberts \"wanted to accept responsibility and that's what he did,\" though Parrish said personally that the moment was \"not one of the happiest\" in his long legal career.",
      "In a targeted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, Roberts was pulled over in his school-issued Jeep Cherokee and allegedly fled from federal agents. They later found the car abandoned near a wooded area and located Roberts with the help of state troopers. Authorities said a loaded handgun was wrapped in a towel under the seat and there was $3,000 in cash in the car.",
      "A federal grand jury in October returned a two-count indictment. According to the plea agreement, Roberts admits he knowingly and intentionally made a \"false attestation\" that he was a U.S. citizen on the Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, that he submitted in Des Moines. Roberts answered: \"Yes, your honor\" when asked by the federal judge if that statement on the I-9 was, in fact, false.",
      "That carries a punishment of up to five years in prison and a fine.",
      "Roberts also faced a federal weapons charge, punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine. In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, a second pistol, a rifle and a shotgun were found during a search of Roberts' home, authorities said.",
      "Roberts will forfeit the weapons, according to the agreement.",
      "Roberts completed the I-9 form when he was hired in 2023 and submitted a Social Security card and driver's license as verifying documents, according to the district. He also stated he was a U.S. citizen in his application to the state board of educational examiners, which issued Roberts a professional administrator license in 2023.",
      "Phil Roeder, a spokesperson for Des Moines Public Schools, declined to comment on Roberts' legal proceedings. The district's focus \"remains on serving the educational needs of students,\" he said in a statement.",
      "School board president Jackie Norris said at the time of Roberts' arrest, \"No one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing. The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.\"",
      "According to CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI, Des Moines Public Schools has\u00a0filed a lawsuit against the company\u00a0it hired to perform a background check on Roberts when it was considering hiring him in 2023. The lawsuit alleges the Texas-based firm JG Consulting breached its contract by \"failing to properly vet Roberts and by referring Roberts as a candidate when he could not lawfully hold the position.\"",
      "Roberts was subject to a notice to appear before an immigration judge in October 2020, just months before his work authorization was set to expire, and a final removal order in 2024, authorities said. District officials said they were not aware of the immigration issues.",
      "Parrish has said his client was under the impression from a prior attorney that his immigration case was \"resolved successfully.\" During Thursday's hearing, Parrish mentioned that advice of prior counsel as one of the lines of defense he had discussed with Roberts.",
      "Parrish also said they had discussed arguing to dismiss the firearms charge, citing ongoing court cases addressing Second Amendment rights and telling reporters later that it's an area of the law \"in flux.\" Parrish said during the hearing that one argument in Roberts' favor could have been possession of firearms for self-defense, saying Roberts had gotten threats as superintendent that he had reported to law enforcement.",
      "Parrish told reporters Thursday that the sentencing hearing \"will be most important,\" adding that he will address factors that are likely to impact the court's decision.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the final legislation needed to fund the government through September on Thursday, sending a package of bills to the Senate as lawmakers face a deadline to avoid a partial shutdown next week.",
      "In a 341 to 88 vote, 149 Democrats and 192 Republicans voted in favor of a three-bill package related to the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The chamber also voted 220 to 207 to approve a separate measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The funding bills now head to the Senate for approval. They are expected to be packaged together with two other measures that passed in the lower chamber last week. That should speed up passage in the Senate, but the chamber will still have to work quickly, with just days to go before a Jan. 30 deadline. A brewing winter storm is also threatening to upend senators' plans to return to Washington early next week.",
      "After weeks of working to craft individual funding bills following the longest shutdown in history last year, House and Senate appropriators released the text of the final four pieces of legislation earlier this week. GOP leaders faced hurdles heading into Thursday, with multiple factions looking to use leverage to extract concessions in the final funding fight until September. A procedural vote was on the brink of failing before leaders wrangled the votes needed to move forward.",
      "The DHS appropriations bill was taken up separately after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.",
      "Top Democratic appropriators acknowledged that the DHS funding didn't go as far as some in their party had hoped. But they pointed to several concessions they secured, including new restrictions on DHS' ability to allocate funds if it does not comply with reporting requirements, new training benchmarks for officers and $20 million for body cameras for immigration enforcement agents.",
      "Democratic leaders said they would oppose it anyway. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said at a news conference that \"ICE is totally out of control, using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families.\"",
      "\"The American people deserve an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that conducts itself in a manner consistent with every other law enforcement agency in the country,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The measure ultimately picked up enough support for passage, with moderate Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged lawmakers to \"listen to the common-sense reasonable Democrats who helped to put these bills together.\"",
      "The speaker touted the funding bills more broadly, saying they would \"fund the Trump agenda and Republican efforts to restore peace through strength, to defend our borders and to deport criminal illegal aliens, to rebuild America's infrastructure and to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Republican leaders have pushed for a return to regular order in the appropriations process, pursuing the passage of all 12 funding bills rather than last-minute \"omnibus\" packages that have become commonplace in recent years. Johnson celebrated the appropriations work on Wednesday, saying there were many people who claimed \"that this could not be done, that a regular appropriations process is a thing of the past.\"",
      "\"Critics said our margins were too slim to bring it back, to rebuild that muscle memory that I committed to when I became speaker,\" Johnson said. \"They said we had too many bills left to pass and too many disagreements left to reconcile. But I'm happy to report that all of those prognostications were flat wrong, and we've gotten it done.\"",
      "In a surprise move on Thursday, the House also approved an amendment that would repeal a controversial provision that allows senators to sue for $500,000 if federal investigators search their phone records without their knowledge. The move effectively jams the upper chamber by including the repeal in the funding package without the necessary time to reverse course, giving the Senate no option but to approve it.",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month.

    "summary": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicts that first-quarter economic growth will heat up to 5%. But sustaining that pace won't be easy, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Trump administration officials are forecasting a boom for the U.S. economy in 2026, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and historically large tax refunds.",
      "\"This quarter \u2014 the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 the United States of America's $30 trillion economy will exceed 5% growth,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox Business on Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By the end of 2026, he added, \"You're going to see 6% growth from the United States of America.\"",
      "That would mark the fastest economic growth since late 2021, when the economy grew at a blistering 7% annual pace after many businesses started reopening during the pandemic. Outside of a few post-pandemic statistical outliers, economic activity in the U.S. has historically moved at a far more measured pace, typically averaging between 2% and 3% per quarter on an annualized basis.",
      "As outlined by Lutnick, the U.S. economy could get a lift this year if President Trump appoints a new Federal Reserve chair more inclined to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate, a move that could spur growth. Consumers could also have more money in their pockets from larger tax refunds under the Republicans' tax and spending law, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's possible \u2014 I would say it's even likely on a one-off basis,\" Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at financial services company Truist, told CBS News of Mr. Lutnick's forecast. But he added that maintaining that growth for a full year is \"a really tough hill to climb.\"",
      "That's because a number of economic headwinds are likely to persist into 2026 and could blunt any lift from lower borrowing costs and larger tax refunds, Skordeles said. Those include trade tensions stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, as well as business uncertainty driven by the administration's shifting economic policies.",
      "\"Those are not positives for the economy,\" Skordeles told CBS News. \"One of those reasons why we're not growing faster is uncertainty.\"",
      "Truist forecasts 2.3% economic growth for all of 2026, while projections by other Wall Street economists range from 2% to 2.5%.",
      "A White House official pointed out that Lutnick's forecast is in line with the Atlanta Fed's forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%.",
      "Risk of overheating",
      "The latest readings on the U.S. economy show a jump in growth, with third-quarter GDP expanding at a 4.3% annualized rate, according to recent government data.",
      "On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is \"likely accelerating,\" citing an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tool that pegs fourth-quarter GDP growth at 5.4%. The Commerce Department will announce fourth-quarter growth data on Feb. 20.",
      "Yet there are risks to boosting the economy through interest-rate cuts and bigger tax refunds. Those same catalysts contributed to the searing inflation that drove the Consumer Price Index to a 40-year high in 2022.",
      "\"What the secretary was intimating earlier today, to me, that doesn't unlock a bunch of growth \u2014 it unlocks a bunch of inflation,\" Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundworks, a liberal-leaning think tank.",
      "Inflation still isn't down to the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate, with the December CPI showing that prices rose at a 2.7% annualized rate. Food prices remain elevated, rising at an annual pace of 3.1% last month due to sharply higher costs of staples like beef and coffee.",
      "\"It's not a single silver bullet that if we just lowered the [Fed's interest] rate, it would make everything magically better,\" Skordeles said. \"You start giving these tax incentives, and you put more money in people's pockets \u2014 it's the classic 'too many dollars chasing too few goods'.\"",
      "Would workers benefit?",
      "Consumers remain generally dour about the U.S. economy, with recent CBS News polling finding that Americans want Mr. Trump to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "\"Lower-income households have experienced weaker wage growth in 2025, while inflation has steadily eroded their checking and savings balances,\" analysts with PNC Economics Research said in a report this week.",
      "While a stronger economy can translate into higher wages in many industries, workers are taking home a smaller slice of the economic pie. The labor share of the nation's GDP slid to its lowest point since 1947, dropping to 53.8% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Even sharply higher economic growth might not do much to assuage public frustration with the cost of food, rent and other affordability issues, Pancotti said, pointing to the example of the strong post-pandemic growth under President Joe Biden. While GDP grew at a 7% pace for two quarters in 2021, Americans were more focused on pocketbook issues such as higher grocery and housing costs, she added.",
      "\"Joe Biden had [strong GDP growth], and yet his marks on the economy were low, given that people want lower prices,\" she added. \"They want to be able to afford their grocery bills and send their kids to summer camp.\"",

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",
      "\"One Battle After Another\" didn't do too terribly for itself, racking up 13 nominations total, including a double-dip in best supporting actor between Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn.",

      "What were the biggest snubs of the Oscar nominations?",
      "Among acting snubs, Chase Infiniti (\"One Battle After Another\") was tipped to be nominated for best actress, and Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet\") was expected in best supporting actor, however some noted that there may have been category confusion over whether the two were leading or supporting performances.",

      "The best director race was always going to boast a few high-profile snubs, but most expected Guillermo Del Toro (\"Frankenstein\") to factor in, given his nomination at the Directors Guild Awards.",
      "After \"Wicked\" earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, many thought its sequel would factor into at least a few races, despite more tepid critical notices. In the end, the film was blanked entirely. Not quite as stark a departure from earlier heats, but James Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" also earned just two nominations, a franchise low.",

      "\"The Air Force remains committed to expediting delivery of the VC-25 bridge aircraft in support of the Presidential airlift mission, with an anticipated delivery no later than summer 2026,\" an Air Force spokesperson said Wednesday, confirming a report by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "The royal family of Qatar donated the Boeing 747-style plane for Mr. Trump's use last spring. The plane could not enter service immediately, though, as the Pentagon needed to retrofit it to serve as Air Force One. It also needed to be checked for security and spying devices before it was accepted, a source told CBS News at the time.",
      "The donated plane could take the place of two 35-year-old jets that currently serve as Air Force One. Mr. Trump has long pushed to replace the aging planes, but a project to replace them has faced delays, with delivery of two new planes currently set for 2027 and 2028.",
      "The existing planes showed their age late Tuesday, when Air Force One turned around less than an hour after taking off for Switzerland due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" The president then switched to a smaller plane before flying across the Atlantic for the World Economic Forum.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joked at one point during the ordeal that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better.\"",
      "The donation has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and watchdog groups, who have argued it poses ethics concerns for the president to accept a gift worth hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign country. Some critics have also questioned the cost of retrofitting the donated plane.",
      "\"The fact that taxpayers are now funding a fifth Air Force One, originating from a foreign monarchy, is a staggering abuse of public trust, fiscal priorities, and national security interests,\" said Virginia Canter, chief counsel for ethics and anti-corruption at Democracy Defenders Fund, a group run by an Obama-era ethics official that requested an investigation into the gift last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has brushed off the concerns and defended his decision to accept the gift.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said last year. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",

    "story": [
      "A car wash chain with locations across Indiana and Minnesota ranks as the best place to work in the U.S., according to employee reviews on job site Glassdoor.",
      "Indianapolis-based Crew Carwash scored the top spot on Glassdoor's 100 Best Places to Work in 2026. Crew, a family-owned business that last year earned the second spot on the list, employs about 1,000 part- and full-time workers across its 55 locations in the Midwest.",
      "Glassdoor bases its rankings on insiders' takes on criteria that can determine a\u00a0good job, ranging from opportunities for career growth to satisfaction with compensation and benefits. Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",
      "Tech companies losing dominance",
      "Although tech companies remain the best-represented industry on the list, taking 24 spots, they appear to be losing their luster among workers. That number is down from 26 spots in 2025 and 31 in 2024.",
      "\"This is part of an ongoing trend where many tech employers are trimming some of the things that made the job so appealing over the last year,\" Zhao said. \"They are pushing harder and harder on efficiency and productivity.\"",
      "To be sure, \"there is still an enormous career and income upside, and you see that reflected in chipmaker Nvidia ranking third,\" he said.",
      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",
      "Only two companies have made the list for each of the 18 years Glassdoor has released the rankings: Bain & Company, which ranked No. 8 in 2026, and Google, which stands at No. 11 this year.",
      "Some white-collar employers are also dropping off the list, as some workers start to view blue-collar work as less likely to be supplanted by AI, Zhao said.",
      "\"There is still a balance with many industries represented,\" Zhao said. \"But it is reflective of the overall trend in the job market where we are seeing hiring freeze up in white-collar industries.\"",

      "President Trump said Thursday that Canada is no longer invited to join his\u00a0international Board of Peace, following days of tension between the president and the United States' northern neighbor.",
      "The president announced the move in a message to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Truth Social, saying the Board of Peace \"is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and Global Affairs Canada for clarification.",
      "The decision came after Mr. Trump formally launched the Board of Peace at an event early Thursday in Davos, Switzerland. The board's official mandate is to help oversee the Gaza Strip under an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal brokered by the Trump administration last year, though Mr. Trump has hinted at broader ambitions, and exactly how it will operate remains unclear.",
      "Representatives from more than a dozen countries \u2014 not including Canada \u2014 appeared at a signing ceremony for the board's charter.",
      "Carney told reporters last week that he agreed \"in principle\" to join the Board of Peace, but he noted that key details on how the board would work and how it would fund Gaza's reconstruction remained unsettled. He also called \"unimpeded aid flows\" to Gaza a \"precondition for moving forward.\"",
      "His government also ruled out paying to get a seat on the board. A U.S. official previously told CBS News that countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members of the Board of Peace rather than having a three-year membership, though payment was not required as a condition of joining. Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters earlier this week that \"Canada is not going to pay if we were to join the Board of Peace.\"",
      "It's not clear why Mr. Trump rescinded Canada's invitation. But the U.S. leader has exchanged harsh words with Carney in recent days, adding to a monthslong dispute between the two neighboring countries over trade and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Carney warned that the world is \"in the midst of a rupture.\" He pointed to the growing use of \"tariffs as leverage,\" the decline of international institutions and the risk that \"[i]f great powers abandon even the pretense of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.\"",
      "Carney didn't name-check Mr. Trump, but the speech was widely interpreted in part as a response to Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, which has drawn scrutiny in recent days due to his push for the U.S. to take over Greenland.",
      "A day later, in his own speech in Davos, Mr. Trump lashed out at Carney, accusing him of showing ingratitude toward the U.S. despite getting \"a lot of freebies from us.\"",
      "\"I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. But they should be grateful to us,\" the president said at one point. \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"",

      "The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Trump announced \u2014 on the first day of his second term \u2014 that America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\"In my opinion, it's the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations' specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The loss of that funding and support is a matter of life and death, according to Dr. Judd Walson, an infectious disease physician, epidemiologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University who works to improve child survival, growth and development in low- and middle-income settings.",
      "\"There's an estimated over 750,000 excess deaths that will occur this year because of these changes, most of those in children,\" Walson told CBS News.",
      "Without U.S. participation and funding, he said, WHO has had to \"downsize considerably.\"",
      "\"There's less resources for data monitoring for potential threats such as pandemics, emerging disease threats. There's less resources for helping to support supply chains. All of those direct impacts of the financial consequences of our withdrawal are real, and there are many other impacts as well, that we will see as countries no longer have access to support their health systems,\" he said.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency's \"failure to adopt urgently needed reforms\" and its \"inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn't airborne, a stance it didn't officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \"shortsighted and misguided\" and \"scientifically reckless.\"",
      "\"It fails to acknowledge the fundamental natural history of infectious diseases. Global cooperation is not a luxury; it is a biological necessity,\" Nahass said.",
      "\"This not only makes Americans less safe, it makes the citizens of other nations less safe,\" Tom Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told KFF Health News when the plans were announced.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot wall itself off from transnational health threats,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",
      "It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.",
      "Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be \"at the front of the line\" when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",
      "Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but \"is China going to sign a contract with the United States?\" Gostin said. \"Are countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.\"",
      "Gostin also believes President Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.",
      "The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal \u2014 which it did \u2014 but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.",
      "The U.S. has not paid any of its dues for 2024 and 2025, leaving a balance of more than $133 million, according to WHO.",
      "An administration official denied that requirement Thursday, saying the U.S. had no obligation to pay prior to withdrawing as a member.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House defeated the latest war powers resolution on Thursday in response to President Trump's recent military operation in Venezuela.",
      "Democrats continue to hammer the issue and have repeatedly tried to block further military action in the South American country, but the efforts have lacked enough GOP support.",
      "Two Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the measure, which narrowly failed in a 215 to 215 vote.",
      "Republicans had to hold the 2-minute vote open for more than 20 minutes until Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas arrived to cast the tie-breaking vote, which defeated the measure. The delay in closing the vote caused an outcry from Democrats.",
      "\"Close the vote!\" Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York yelled as it was on the brink of passage without Hunt's vote. \"This is serious s***!\"",
      "The vote comes a week after the White House peeled off GOP support for a similar measure in the Senate that also narrowly failed to advance. Two Senate Republicans who flipped their votes to help sink the resolution said Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave them assurances that the president would seek congressional authorization if the administration plans to put U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "The House resolution, introduced by Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, \"directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.\"",
      "Two prior attempts to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region fell short in December, before this month's U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The first measure from last month \u2014 with the broader focus of removing U.S. armed forces from \"hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere\" \u2014 had the support of two Republicans, while two Democrats voted against it. The second resolution focused on \"hostilities within or against Venezuela.\" Three Republicans voted in favor and one Democrat opposed it.",
      "McGovern's latest resolution had a similar outcome. Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska both backed it. The two also supported the previous unsuccessful efforts.",
      "Bacon pointed to a fake image shared by Mr. Trump earlier this week, showing the president, vice president and secretary of state planting an American flag on Greenland. The image included a sign that claimed Greenland as a U.S. territory as of 2026.",
      "\"When you ask me why I voted the way I did on the War Powers Resolution later this week\u2026 here's one reason,\" Bacon wrote.",
      "When the Senate's efforts to rein in future military action in Venezuela had short-lived momentum, Massie said he was hopeful that more Republicans in the House would change their stance. Days earlier, the U.S. had captured Maduro in an operation that came as a surprise to Congress. Mr. Trump then asserted the U.S. was running the country, worrying some Republicans who had previously defended the president's authority to carry out strikes on dozens of boats allegedly smuggling illicit drugs.",
      "Any GOP criticism of the strikes has mostly quieted as attention has shifted to Mr. Trump's crusade to acquire Greenland.",
      "Democrats have indicated they plan to keep forcing votes on the issue, especially after Mr. Trump and members of his administration have threatened military intervention against other countries, including Greenland, Iran, Colombia, Mexico and Cuba.",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",

      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "Why does the United States want Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs control of the island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree on.",
      "The president now says a \"long-term deal\" is in the works. Here's why Mr. Trump has been so focused on the semi-autonomous Danish territory, and why NATO allies and Greenland say the U.S. could achieve its aims without a takeover.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Jan. 4, claiming \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",
      "The Danish government has made it clear that the U.S. is welcome to expand its military presence in Greenland, and that protecting the island from any potential adversaries should be the joint responsibility of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said, \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",
      "When asked earlier this month what specifically the United States would gain in terms of national security by taking control of Greenland, given all that the U.S. is able to do already, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"More control over the Arctic region and ensuring that China and Russia and our adversaries cannot continue their aggression in this very important and strategic region. And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",

      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages.",
      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",
      "Greenland's natural resources",
      "Greenland has reserves of oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.It would be very expensive to explore and develop those resources.Greenland has long said it's open for business if American companies are interested in exploring.",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",
      "Would Trump use military force to take Greenland?",
      "Mr. Trump said on Jan. 21, \"I don't want to use force, I won't use force\" to take Greenland.He had previously declined to take the option off the table, saying the U.S. could do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way.\"",

      "\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But, I won't do that. Okay?\" he said in his address on Jan. 21. \"Now everyone's saying 'oh, good.' That's probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"seeking immediate negotiations\" \u2014 and then announced, after a meeting with the NATO secretary general, that a deal has been reached.",
      "Previously, the president and White House officials had suggested military force was among the options being considered.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0on Jan. 9, without explaining what that could involve. The White House stated that a range of options, including the use of military force, were under consideration.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\"\u00a0he said Jan. 11.",

      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "As Mr. Trump doubled down on his vows to take control of Greenland one way or another, and threatened eight of America's closest allies with tariffs if they refuse to bow to his demand, thousands of residents of the island marched in its capital Nuuk to reject his rhetoric.",

      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News earlier this week that France intended to decline due to concerns that the Board of Peace charter goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises major issues, particularly regarding respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said Monday night he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne if they did not join the Board of Peace. The White House has not responded to several inquiries as to whether or not the president was joking.",
      "A French official said they have taken note of Mr. Trump's statements and called the use of tariff threats to influence France's foreign policy unacceptable and ineffective.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the board a work in progress, indicating an expectation by the Trump administration that membership would rise. \"Many others who are going to join, you know, others either are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own countries, in their own country, because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,\" Rubio said in Davos on Thursday.",
      "Is the Board of Peace intended to replace the United Nations?",
      "President Trump said\u00a0Thursday that the board would be committed to ensuring Gaza's demilitarization, and hinted at wider ambitions for the group going forward.",
      "He said the board would work \"coupled with the United Nations\" to create a \"safer future for the world, unfolding before your eyes,\" adding that the board would help to \"end decades of suffering.\"",
      "The president also said the board can do \"pretty much whatever we want to do\" once it is formed, and that \"we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said the Board of Peace \"might\" replace the world's primary global body.",
      "\"I mean, the U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I'm a big fan of the U.N. potential. But it has never lived up to its potential,\" he said in a more than 90-minute press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Jan. 20.",
      "But he added, \"I believe you've got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.\"",
      "In November, the United Nations passed a Security Council resolution that approved a \"Board of Peace,\" but with a focus limited only to Gaza.",
      "The resolution welcomed the establishment of a Board of Peace \"as a transitional administration with international legal personality\" that would set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. resolution more broadly endorsed the Trump administration's 20-point Gaza peace plan, and authorized countries working with the Board of Peace to establish a stabilization force inside the Palestinian territory.",
      "Is a financial contribution required to join?",
      "A U.S. official confirmed a Bloomberg report that countries can contribute $1 billion to the Board of Peace to become permanent members instead of having a three-year membership. The official also said it isn't a requirement to contribute to become a member.",
      "The official told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza and said \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the board's mandate. There will be no \"exorbitant salaries\" or \"administrative bloat,\" the official said.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified in his lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he will not be imposing tariffs against European countries over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland, revealing Wednesday that he and the secretary-general of NATO reached \"the framework of a future deal\" regarding the island.",
      "\"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post from Davos, Switzerland, following a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "In an interview with CNBC shortly after his post, the president said \"we have a concept of a deal\" and that he thinks it will be \"a very good deal for the United States, also for them.\"",
      "\"We're going to work together on something having to do with the Arctic as a whole, but also Greenland. And it has to do with the security, great security, strong security, and other things,\" he said.",
      "He declined to provide specifics of the framework, saying \"it's a little bit complex\" and that the U.S. will \"explain it down the line.\" He did note that the agreement would last \"forever.\"",
      "\"It's the kind of a deal that I wanted to be able to make,\" Mr. Trump told CNBC.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent and \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan that that there is no agreement for U.S. control or ownership of Greenland. The framework of the deal, according to the sources, would ramp up security for Greenland beyond the existing 1951 U.S. agreement, which allowed the U.S. to establish several military bases on the island, although the only one that is still operating is Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base. It would also increase NATO's role with the specific intent of blocking Russia and China from gaining a foothold in Greenland, the sources said. But such a deal would still need to be directly negotiated with Denmark and Greenland.",
      "U.S. ownership of the territory is still a red line for Denmark and Greenland, the sources said.",
      "NATO was similarly tight-lipped about details of the arrangement. In a statement, Allison Hart, a spokesperson for the alliance, said Mr. Trump and Rutte's meeting was \"very productive\" and that they \"discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States.\"",
      "\"Discussions among NATO Allies on the framework the President referenced will focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts of Allies, especially the seven Arctic Allies,\" Hart said. \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold \u2014 economically or militarily \u2014 in Greenland.\"",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, also issued a statement, saying the day \"is ending on a better note than it began.\"",
      "\"We welcome that President Trump has ruled out to take Greenland by force and paused the trade war with Europe. Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" it said.",
      "The president addressed the annual meeting of global leaders at the World Economic Forum earlier in the day and reiterated his insistence that the U.S. needs to own the semi-autonomous Danish territory for security reasons. But, for the first time, he ruled out the use of military force to take control of the island, and said he was instead \"seeking immediate negotiations\" over the territory.",
      "Over the weekend, the president threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his Greenland push beginning next month, and said the tariff would increase to 25% if the U.S. did not acquire the island. The threat of a trade war with longstanding allies sent shockwaves through European capitals, with leaders scrambling to address the threat and defend Greenland and Denmark's autonomy before gathering in Davos.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that owning Greenland is critical for completing his \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield, and that NATO should back his acquisition of the territory to defend against Russia and China. In his Truth Social post, he said that discussions over the missile shield will continue.",
      "\"Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland,\" he said. \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations \u2014 They will report directly to me.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote in a text exchange with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re on Jan. 19: \u00a0\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Details:\u00a0In the text exchange with St\u00f8re, Mr. Trump questioned Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland, writing there are \"no written documents\" establishing ownership.",
      "The claim is false.",
      "There are written agreements and court rulings establishing Denmark's claim to Greenland, including a declaration by the U.S. secretary of state in 1916 which explicitly recognized Danish control over the territory. An international court also ruled in 1933 that Denmark held valid sovereignty over the entire island.",
      "Danish explorers and settlers began colonizing Greenland in the early 1700s, at a time when the U.S. was still a British colony.",
      "\"Danish expeditions reached and settled Greenland centuries ago,\" Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told CBS News in an email. \"Since then, Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland has been internationally recognized, including by the U.S., just as similar claims are recognized for many other nations around the world.\"",
      "Trump's claim that Russian and Chinese ships surround Greenland",
      "Trump said in a press gaggle\u00a0on Jan. 4: \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\" (Press gaggle, January 4)",
      "Mr. Trump said at a Jan. 9 press conference: \"We need that because if you take a look outside of Greenland right now, there are Russian destroyers. There are Chinese destroyers and bigger. There are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland, and that's what they're going to do if we don't.\"",
      "Details: Trump has also repeatedly claimed that a large number of Russian and Chinese ships are currently operating near Greenland.",
      "There is no evidence to support that claim.",
      "Greenland's minister of business Naaja Nathanielsen said she was \"not aware\" of any Russian and Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland when asked about Mr.Trump's comments\u00a0 earlier this month.",
      "Public ship-tracking data from MarineTraffic does not show any Russian- or Chinese-flagged commercial vessels around Greenland, with most traffic consisting of fishing boats. While vessels can turn off their transponders or spoof their locations, experts say there is no indication of the large-scale naval presence Mr. Trump has described.",
      "\"The claim by President Trump of Russian and Chinese ships all over the place does not hold,\"\u00a0 Romain Chuffart, the managing director of The Arctic Institute, a non-profit think tank, told CBS News by email.",
      "Other experts have noted that Russian naval activity in the Arctic is concentrated near Norway, while China's Arctic involvement has focused on trade with Russia and exercises near Alaska.",
      "Trump's claim that Denmark's defenses in Greenland consist of \"two dog sleds\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Jan. 11: \"And Greenland basically, their defense is two dog sleds. Do you know that? You know what their defense is? Two dog sleds.\"",
      "Details: \u00a0In jest or not, that is incorrect. While Danish special forces do operate the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol \u2014 a special force which patrols remote, icy areas using sled dogs \u2014 that is just one part of its military presence.",
      "Denmark deploys Arctic patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft, and maintains a military base in Nuuk with about 150 personnel, according to the Danish Ministry of Defense.",
      "Danish officials have also committed roughly $6.5 billion to modernize military capabilities in Greenland over the next decade, Chuffart said.",
      "As for the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, the 12-person team uses dog sleds because it is \"the most adequate mode of transportation in the region,\" \u00a0according to Chuffart.",
      "The U.S. already operates an air base in Greenland and has the option to expand its presence under a 1951 agreement with Denmark. Danish officials have said they would welcome greater U.S. cooperation on security \u2014 but insist Greenland is not for sale.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:34:55 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",
      "The banking industry has opposed the cap, saying it would limit consumers' access to credit and steer them toward riskier lending products.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/water-bankruptcy-world-un-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 13:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Water sources are being depleted faster than they can be restored, according to a new report from United Nations researchers.",
    "story": [
      "The planet is entering an era of global \"water bankruptcy,\" a United Nations research agency said in a new report, which warns that humans' water use over the long term has exceeded the renewable water sources worldwide and, potentially, passed a point of no return.",
      "\"Bankruptcy\" means the Earth's water repositories, such as rivers, lakes and aquifers, are being depleted at faster rates than they can be restored, according to the\u00a0report from researchers at the United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH).",
      "\"In many regions, human-water systems are already in a post-crisis state of failure,\" the report's authors wrote.",
      "That failure, they say, is a result of decades of overstretching, in which \"societies have withdrawn more water than climate and hydrology can reliably provide\" while environmental factors like pollution shrank the amount of water that can be safely used by degrading its quality. The consequences are measurable, especially in deeply affected regions in the Middle East and North Africa, parts of South Asia and the American Southwest.",
      "There are dozens of major rivers that fail to reach the sea for parts of the year, and many river basins and aquifers have been \"overdrawing\" their shares of water for at least the last five decades, according to the report. Half of the world's large lakes have lost water since the early 1990s, a pattern of decline that impacts roughly 25% of the global population. Researchers say increased demand for that water, as well as changing inflows and rising temperatures, are largely to blame.",
      "While river basins also experience alterations in their typical flow, the wetland environments that scientists describe as traditional \"shock absorbers\" for the water cycle are disappearing, too. More than 1 billion acres of natural wetlands have been erased over the last 50 years \u2014 an area that is roughly equal to the size of continental Europe \u2014 threatening the communities they normally help to protect from floods and drought.",
      "\"These are not simply signs of stress or episodes of crisis,\" the report said. \"They are symptoms of systems that have overspent their hydrological budget and eroded the natural capital that once made recovery possible, with knock-off effects for food prices, employment, migration and geopolitical stability.\"",
      "About 75% of the human population reside in countries that have been classified as \"water-insecure\" or \"critically water-insecure,\" according to the report. That means their nations cannot reliably provide them with enough water that meets basic safety and quality standards.",
      "Within that group, some 4 billion people face severe water scarcities for at least one month each year, 3.5 billion lack safely managed sanitation and 2.2 billion lack safely managed drinking water, the report said. Another 3 billion live in areas where the total water storage is declining or unstable, and at least half of the world's food is produced in those same regions.",
      "\"Millions of farmers are trying to grow more food from shrinking, polluted, or disappearing water sources,\" said Kaveh Madani, director of the UNU-INWEH and the report's lead author, in a statement. \"Without rapid transitions toward water-smart agriculture, water bankruptcy will spread rapidly.\"",
      "The report recommended a combination of efforts to address the water bankruptcy, including aiming to restore what has been lost, staving off ongoing depletion and adapting to the amount of usable water that exists now.",
      "\"Water bankruptcy is becoming a driver of fragility, displacement, and conflict,\" said U.N. Under-Secretary-General Tshilidzi Marwala in a separate statement. \"Managing it fairly \u2014 ensuring that vulnerable communities are protected and that unavoidable losses are shared equitably \u2014 is now central to maintaining peace, stability, and social cohesion.\"",

    "summary": "Lawyers for Reza Valizadeh, a U.S. citizen arrested in 2024 by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, filed a petition Tuesday with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.",
    "story": [
      "When Abdolreza \"Reza\" Valizadeh returned to Iran in the spring of 2024, it was the first time he had set foot in his home country in 15 years. The veteran journalist, who had spent more than a decade in exile, traveled to Iran to see and care for his aging parents.",
      "Six months later, he was in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.",
      "Valizadeh, a 49-year-old dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and longtime critic of Iran's security establishment, was arrested on Sept. 22, 2024, by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His detention, detailed in a petition filed Tuesday by his attorney with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, comes amid Iran's sweeping crackdown on protests across the country, and as tensions with Washington simmer.",
      "The State Department formally designated Valizadeh as \"wrongfully detained\" in May 2025, placing his case under the authority of the U.S. government's hostage affairs office. Valizadeh is one of at least four Iranian-Americans currently held in Iran, including 70-year-old Kamran Hekmati and at least one other septuagenarian, a woman, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"In lodging this petition to the UN, alongside pulling every lever of power available to us in D.C., we are committed to bringing attention to Reza's case, not only to secure his release, but to send an unequivocal message that the targeting of U.S. citizens abroad will not be tolerated,\" Ryan Fayhee, counsel to Valizadeh and a partner at the law firm Akin Gump, said in a statement.",
      "\"Every day that Reza remains behind bars, the Iranian regime is emboldened to target Americans who dare to advocate for truth, justice, and a better future for the Iranian people,\" Fayhee said.",
      "Valizadeh's case continues to unfold against a volatile backdrop inside Iran, where thousands of protesters\u00a0are believed to have been killed, and many thousands more arrested, as authorities have cracked down on recent demonstrations over economic hardship and political repression. A near-total internet and communications blackout has been in place for more than two weeks.",
      "U.S. officials have condemned Tehran's treatment of protesters, warning of further economic pressure \u2014 and possible military strikes \u2014 while leaving open the possibility of talks. Iranian leaders have accused Washington of interference, raising concerns among rights advocates that Americans held in Iran could be used as leverage as tensions sharpen.",
      "President Trump said last week he held off on striking Iran after being assured by the regime that the executions of hundreds of protesters had been \"canceled,\" but in a recent interview called for \"new leadership\" in Iran. The U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group has begun to move west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East, CBS News has confirmed, and is expected to arrive in the coming days.",
      "\"The Trump administration is closely monitoring Mr. Valizadeh's case. President Trump has been clear that he wants every wrongfully detained American returned home,\" a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The State Department and a spokesperson for the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "\"These Americans must come home\"",
      "Valizadeh became a U.S. citizen in 2022 through his work for U.S.-funded broadcaster Radio Farda, the Persian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "According to messages relayed to his attorney by his family, Valizadeh believed he had been given assurances by Iranian authorities that it was safe to return to Tehran, where most of his family resides. His brother has said he now believes those guarantees were part of a trap, possibly involving a former colleague who had ties to the IRGC.",
      "Reporting by Persian-language media later cited sources who said Iranian intelligence had hoped to pressure Valizadeh into cooperating against his former employer, Radio Farda, for which he reported on corruption, protests and the influence of the IRGC. He refused.",
      "Days later, IRGC agents detained him on a Tehran street, confiscated his belongings, including his U.S. passport, and took him to Evin Prison, where he spent weeks in isolation and under intense interrogation. Iranian officials did not publicly acknowledge his arrest for nearly two months.",
      "Valizadeh was eventually charged with \"collaborating with a hostile government,\" a vague national security offense that Iranian authorities routinely use against journalists and activists.",
      "In December 2024, after what the petition to the U.N. describes as a sham trial lasting less than an hour, and in which the judge acted as both prosecutor and adjudicator, Valizadeh was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His appeal to the regime was rejected in January 2025.",
      "Since then, his family says Valizadeh's health has steadily deteriorated. He suffers from asthma, which has been worsened by overcrowded cells, poor air quality and exposure to smoke and debris \u2014 conditions that intensified after Israeli airstrikes struck parts of Evin Prison in June 2025 during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He has endured frequent coughing fits and has been denied basic medications, dental care and treatment for gastrointestinal problems.",
      "After the June strikes, Valizadeh was among prisoners who were shackled and transferred to another facility without their belongings or medicine, according to the U.N. filing, before being returned to Evin Prison, where his brother says he now shares a small cell with up to 18 other inmates amid severe shortages of food, water, sanitation and medical care.",
      "Attorneys for other American citizens who were wrongfully detained have petitioned the U.N. for help in the recent past. They included\u00a0Baquer Namazi, who was permitted to leave Iran for life-saving surgery in the UAE in 2022, and Ryan Corbett, who was imprisoned by the Taliban in Afghanistan and released in a prisoners swap in January 2025.",
      "\"Family is at the heart of the Iranian culture. This is why so many Iranian Americans travel back to Iran \u2014 to visit elderly parents and connect with extended family. Unfortunately, this respect for family is also what gives the regime a steady influx of dual nationals to feast on,\" Neda Sharghi, the sister of former wrongful detainee Emad Shargi and an advocate for American hostages and their families, told CBS News. (The siblings use slightly different spellings of their last name.)",
      "\"President Trump has witnessed the brutality of the Iranian regime. He also knows that we have innocent Americans, like recently detained Reza Valizadeh and Kamran Hekmati, among others, ensnared in the regime's hostage-taking tentacles. These Americans must come home and President Trump and his team have shown us that, at least when it comes to American hostages and wrongful detainees, they will do whatever they need to attain their freedom,\" Sharghi said.",
      "With help from Sharghi and Valizadeh's family, Fayhee has received since September three pre-recorded voice messages from Valizadeh describing the circumstances of his detention. The last came on Dec. 20.",
      "Neither Valizadeh nor his family have been in contact since Iran's crackdown and nationwide internet blackout began.",

      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",
      "Which payment providers are being targeted?",
      "Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:",
      "American ExpressDiners ClubDiscover, a subsidiary of Capital OneJCB Co., Ltd.MastercardUnionPay",
      "American Express",

      "Criminals use hidden code to copy payment data while the purchase still goes through normally. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",

      "While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.",
      "Virtual and single-use cards are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:",
      "Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps",
      "Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.",
      "Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers",
      "A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.",
      "Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",

      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems. In short, users get better AI without giving up Apple's privacy stance, at least in theory.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward. If Apple delivers on its promises, this deal could finally close the AI gap that has frustrated users and investors alike. The real test will come when those features land on your devices.",

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OKIf they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third dayThe alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OK",
      "If they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third day",
      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",

      "Making the app more friendly for older users",
      "Reconsidering the app's name",
      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "\"Are You Dead?\" succeeds because it addresses a fear many people rarely say out loud. As more people live alone, the worry is not only about loneliness but also about invisibility.

      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning about a growing cyber threat that turns everyday QR codes into spying tools.",
      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",

      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some quishing sites collect device and location data even if you do nothing. A data removal service helps reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. That makes it harder for attackers to target you with convincing spear phishing emails that include QR codes.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.",

      "What happened in the Illinois DHS data breach",
      "As spotted by Bleeping Computer, the Illinois Department of Human Services disclosed that unauthorized access to one of its systems led to the exposure of records tied to approximately 700,000 Illinois residents. The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.",
      "According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.",
      "For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",

Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "For the first time, Americans with depression will soon be able to use a prescription brain-stimulation device at home.",
      "The approval comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and marks a major shift in how mental health conditions may be treated. The newly approved device is called FL-100, and it comes from Flow Neuroscience.",
      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy. This decision matters because depression affects more than 20 million adults in the U.S. Roughly one-third do not get enough relief from medication or stop taking it due to side effects.",

      "SIMPLE DAILY HABIT MAY HELP EASE DEPRESSION MORE THAN MEDICATION, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "Flow Neuroscience has gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its FL-100 prescription brain-stimulation device. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine, adding credibility to the findings. Side effects were generally mild and short-term. Reported issues included skin irritation, redness, headaches, and brief stinging sensations at the electrode sites.",

      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "Flow Neuroscience\u2019s FL-100 headset delivers mild electrical stimulation to the brain and can be prescribed for home use under medical supervision. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This FDA approval feels like a real turning point. For years, brain stimulation for depression stayed locked inside clinics. Now it can happen at home with a doctor still guiding the process. That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with.

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'",
      "The Apple iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the United States and one of the most widely used devices in the world. An estimated 1.6 billion people rely on iPhones every day. That massive user base also makes the platform a prime target.",

      "Apple is warning iPhone users about a serious Safari security flaw that could leave hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable if updates are delayed. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "What Apple discovered in Safari and WebKit",
      "Late last month, Apple confirmed two critical vulnerabilities in WebKit. WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.",
      "Why millions of iPhones are still exposed",
      "Apple moved quickly to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast. Attackers know exactly what to exploit.",
      "iPhone and iPad models at the highest risk",

      "Why upgrading is the only real protection",
      "There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the latest software is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.",
      "Steps to update your iPhone or iPad now",

      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software",
      "Keeping your iPhone updated is critical, but it should not be your only line of defense. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by scanning malicious links, blocking risky websites and alerting you to suspicious activity before damage is done.",
      "This matters even more when attacks rely on compromised websites or hidden browser exploits. Security software can help catch threats that slip through and give you extra visibility into what is happening on your device.",

      "Apple rarely uses language like \"extremely sophisticated\" unless the threat is serious. This flaw shows how even trusted browsers can become attack paths when updates are delayed.

      "Payment history and partial payment card information",
      "Appointment and order records tied to customer accounts",
      "If accurate, that combination of data could create serious identity theft and fraud risks for affected customers.",
      "Brightspeed responds to the allegations",
      "Brightspeed says it takes the situation seriously, even as it continues to verify the claims.",
      "In a statement shared with BleepingComputer, the company said it is rigorously monitoring threats and working to understand what happened. Brightspeed added that it will keep customers, employees and authorities informed as more details become available.",
      "So far, there has been no public notice on Brightspeed's website or social media channels confirming customer data exposure.",
      "Who Brightspeed is and why this matters",
      "Brightspeed is a U.S. telecommunications and internet service provider founded in 2022 after Apollo Global Management acquired local exchange assets from Lumen Technologies.",
      "Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company serves rural and suburban communities across 20 states. It has rapidly expanded its fiber footprint, passing more than 2 million homes and businesses and aiming to reach over 5 million locations.",
      "Because Brightspeed focuses on underserved areas, many customers rely on it as their primary internet provider. That makes any potential breach especially concerning.",
      "A closer look at Crimson Collective",
      "Crimson Collective is not new to high-profile targets. In October, the group breached a GitLab instance tied to Red Hat, stealing hundreds of gigabytes of internal development data.",
      "That incident later rippled outward. In December, Nissan confirmed that personal data for about 21,000 Japanese customers was exposed through the same breach.",
      "More recently, researchers say Crimson Collective has targeted cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, by abusing exposed credentials and creating rogue access accounts to escalate privileges.",
      "In other words, the group has a track record that makes its claims hard to ignore.",
      "What this could mean for customers",
      "Even though Brightspeed has not confirmed a breach, the claims alone are enough to raise red flags. If customer data was accessed, it could be used for phishing scams, account takeovers or payment fraud.",
      "Cybercriminals often move fast after breaches. That means customers should stay alert even before an official notice appears.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to Brightspeed for comment, and a spokesperson told us,",
      "\"We take the security of our networks and protection of our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 information seriously and are rigorous in securing our networks and monitoring threats. We are currently investigating reports of a cybersecurity event. As we learn more, we will keep our customers, employees, stakeholders and authorities informed.\"",

      "Cybercriminals often use public posts and countdowns to pressure companies into responding quickly. (Sebastian Kahnert/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Scammers often take advantage of breach headlines to create panic. Be cautious with emails, calls or texts that mention your internet account billing problems or service changes. If a message pushes urgency or pressure, pause before responding.",
      "Do not click links or open attachments tied to account notices or payment issues. Instead, open a new browser window and go directly to the company's official website or app. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malicious downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Personal data spreads quietly across data broker sites. Using a data removal service can help limit how much of your information is publicly available. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for scammers to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:17:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The Rictor X4 electric aircraft promises personal flight for $39,900, making eVTOL technology accessible with 50 mph speeds and truck-bed portability.",
    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

      "A new malware campaign is turning WhatsApp Web into a weapon. Security researchers say a banking Trojan linked to Astaroth is now spreading automatically through chat messages, making the attack harder to stop once it starts.",
      "The campaign is known as Boto Cor-de-Rosa. It shows how cybercriminals keep evolving, especially when they can abuse tools people trust every day. This attack focuses on Windows users and uses WhatsApp Web as both the delivery system and the engine that spreads the infection further.",

      "BROWSER EXTENSION MALWARE INFECTED 8.8M USERS IN DARKSPECTRE ATTACK",
      "Attackers abuse the WhatsApp Web to spread malware through messages that appear to come from people you trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this WhatsApp Web attack works",
      "The attack starts with a simple message. A contact sends what looks like a routine ZIP file through WhatsApp. The file name appears random and harmless, which lowers suspicion. Once opened, the ZIP contains a Visual Basic script disguised as a normal document. If the user runs it, the script quietly pulls in two more pieces of malware. Then the script downloads the Astaroth banking malware written in Delphi. It also installs a Python-based module designed to control WhatsApp Web. Both components run in the background without obvious warning signs. From there, the infection becomes self-sustaining.",
      "Malware that spreads itself through your contacts",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is how it propagates. The Python module scans the victim's WhatsApp contacts and sends the malicious ZIP file to every conversation automatically. Researchers at Acronis found that the malware adapts its messages based on the time of day. It sends friendly greetings, making the message feel normal and familiar. The text says, \"Here is the requested file. If you have any questions, I'm available!\" Because the message appears to come from someone you know, many people open it without hesitation.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "A single ZIP file sent through chat can quietly install banking malware and begin spreading to every contact. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Built-in tracking keeps the attack efficient",
      "This malware is carefully designed to monitor its own performance in real time. The propagation tool tracks how many messages are successfully delivered, how many fail to send and the overall sending speed measured per minute. After every 50 messages, it generates progress updates that show how many contacts have been reached. This feedback allows attackers to measure success quickly and make adjustments if something stops working.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "The initial script is heavily obfuscated to avoid detection by antivirus tools. Once it runs, it launches PowerShell commands that download more malware from compromised websites. One known domain used in this campaign is coffe-estilo.com. The malware installs itself inside a folder that mimics a Microsoft Edge cache directory. Inside are executable files and libraries that make up the full Astaroth banking payload. From there, the malware can steal credentials, monitor activity and potentially access financial accounts.",
      "Why WhatsApp Web is being abused",
      "WhatsApp Web is popular because it mirrors your phone conversations on a computer. That convenience makes it easy to send messages, share files and type faster, but it also introduces risk. When you use WhatsApp Web, you link your phone to a browser by scanning a QR code at web.whatsapp.com. Once connected, that browser session becomes a trusted extension of your account. Your chats appear on the screen, messages you send come from your real number and incoming messages sync across both devices.",
      "That setup is exactly what attackers take advantage of. If malware gains access to a computer with WhatsApp Web logged in, it can act as the user. It can read messages, access contact lists and send files or links that look completely legitimate. The messages do not raise alarms because they are coming from a real account, not a fake one.",
      "This is what turns WhatsApp Web into an effective delivery system for malware. Instead of breaking into WhatsApp itself, attackers simply abuse an open browser session to spread malicious files automatically.",
      "Many users do not realize the danger because WhatsApp Web feels harmless. It is often left signed in on work computers, shared devices or systems without strong security. In those situations, malware does not need advanced tricks. It only needs access to an already trusted session. That combination of convenience and trust is why WhatsApp Web has become such an attractive target.",
      "MALICIOUS MAC EXTENSIONS STEAL CRYPTO WALLETS AND PASSWORDS",
      "Once the WhatsApp Web is compromised, malware can act like the user, sending messages and files that look completely legitimate.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web malware",
      "Attacks like this WhatsApp Web malware are designed to spread fast through trusted conversations. A few smart habits can dramatically lower your risk.",
      "Messaging apps feel casual, which is exactly why attackers use them. Never open ZIP files sent through chat unless you confirm with the sender first. Watch for file names made of random numbers or unfamiliar names.\u00a0Treat messages that create urgency or feel overly familiar as a warning sign. If a file arrives out of nowhere, pause before clicking.",
      "This campaign abuses WhatsApp Web to spread automatically once a device is infected. Check active WhatsApp Web sessions and log out of any you do not recognize. Avoid leaving WhatsApp Web signed in on shared or public computers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) inside WhatsApp settings. Cutting off Web access helps limit how far malware can travel.",
      "This type of malware takes advantage of systems that fall behind on updates. Install Windows updates as soon as they are available. Also, keep your web browser fully updated. Staying current closes many of the doors attackers try to slip through. In addition, use strong antivirus software that watches for script abuse and PowerShell activity in real time.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most malware infections happen because people act too quickly. If a message feels off, trust that instinct. Familiar names and friendly language can lower your guard, but they should never replace caution. Take a moment to verify the message or file before opening anything. Attackers rely on trust and urgency to succeed. Slowing down takes away their advantage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This WhatsApp Web malware campaign is a reminder that cyberattacks no longer rely on obvious red flags. Instead, they blend into everyday conversations and use familiar tools to spread quietly and quickly. What makes this threat especially concerning is how little effort it takes for it to move from one device to dozens of others.",
      "A single click can turn a trusted chat into a delivery system for banking malware and identity theft. The good news is that small changes make a big difference. Paying attention to attachments, locking down WhatsApp Web access, keeping devices updated and slowing down before clicking can stop these attacks cold. As messaging platforms continue to play a bigger role in daily life, staying alert is no longer optional. Awareness and simple habits remain some of the strongest defenses you have.",

      "The breath-based design is intended to reduce how often users need finger-prick blood tests, while providing early alerts for glucose-related changes.",
      "The device is named after the inventor's grandson, Isaac, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at just 2 years old. The inventor, Bud Wilcox, wanted to reduce the number of painful finger pricks his grandson faced each day. That personal motivation led to years of collaboration with scientists, designers and engineers. Research and development included work with Indiana University under the direction of Dr. M. Agarwal. The goal was simple but ambitious: Alert families to blood sugar events earlier while reducing the physical and emotional toll of constant testing.",
      "How the isaac device fits into daily life",
      "Isaac is designed to fit into everyday routines. Users breathe into the device, which processes the reading and sends the data to a companion smartphone app. The app, still in its final stages of development, focuses on awareness and safety. Current features include:",
      "A timeline for logging mealsA history of breath readingsAlerts that can notify emergency contacts",
      "A timeline for logging meals",
      "A history of breath readings",
      "Alerts that can notify emergency contacts",
      "This matters because people with diabetes can become disoriented or incapacitated during hypoglycemic events. Early alerts give caregivers or family members a chance to step in. A single charge lasts all day and supports multiple breath tests. The device comes with a USB-C charging cradle and cable.",
      "Who isaac is designed for",
      "According to PreEvnt, isaac is being developed for:",
      "Type 1 diabeticsType 2 diabeticsPrediabetics",
      "Type 1 diabetics",
      "Type 2 diabetics",
      "Prediabetics",
      "It may also appeal to people focused on metabolic health. As mentioned, the device is still undergoing development and FDA review and is not yet for sale in the U.S. The companion app will launch on iOS and Android closer to availability.",
      "TYPE 1 DIABETES REVERSED IN LANDMARK STUDY, PAVING THE WAY FOR HUMAN STUDIES",
      "Designed for everyday use, the isaac wearable device pairs with a smartphone app to log readings and send alerts when needed. (PreEvnt)",
      "Clinical trials and FDA review for the isaac device",
      "PreEvnt first introduced isaac publicly at CES 2025. Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials.\u00a0Those studies compare isaac's breath-based alerts with traditional blood glucose monitoring methods.",
      "Trials began with adolescents who have Type 1 diabetes and later expanded to adults with Type 2 diabetes. The company is now working toward regulatory review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because this technology is new, PreEvnt is pursuing a de novo pathway, which allows devices to be evaluated while standards are still being defined. According to the company, regulators have shown strong interest as the data continues to come in.",
      "Isaac does not claim to replace medical-grade glucose meters. The device is being developed to supplement existing monitoring methods by offering breath-based alerts tied to glucose-related changes.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Noninvasive glucose monitoring has long felt like a future promise that never quite arrives. The attention around isaac at CES 2026 suggests that promise may finally be getting closer. If clinical trials continue to deliver strong results and regulators give approval, breathing into a small device could one day replace at least some finger pricks. For families living with diabetes, that shift could make daily life easier and safer.",

Bovino said the actions he\u2019s witnessed from immigration enforcement agents have been \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201clawful,\u201d after he was asked about concerns from local law enforcement that people were being racially profiled.",
      "In the neighborhood where Good was shot, the streets were covered by snow on Wednesday. At mid-morning, a burst of whistles and car horns broke the icy quiet as drivers and pedestrians blowing whistles started following a group of vehicles they identified as belonging to federal agents. After a few blocks, the cacophony subsided.",
      "Despite days of bone-chilling winter weather, residents could be seen throughout the week on street corners and navigating the snow piles on sidewalks as they monitored any actions by ICE or Border Patrol agents.",
      "Networks of volunteers have grown by the thousands, according to a person who acts as a \u201cdispatcher\u201d to groups, including those who respond quickly to arrest sites in order to document immigration enforcement activity. Volunteer medics and chaplains also roam neighborhoods where ICE operations play out, ready to tend to anyone impacted by tear gas or pepper spray.",
      "\u201cNone of us want to be doing this. I don\u2019t, but we simply cannot stand by as other Minnesotans are being hurt,\u201d said Ben Damberg, who helps thousands of people communicate on Signal channels, coordinating responses to ICE operations around the city. \u201cWe will march, we will protest, and we will do it all peacefully above all else.\u201d",
      "A massive mobilization network",
      "While some residents have been acting as rapid responders, others have been mobilizing and doing the kind of work seen in natural disasters such as floods or fires.",
      "Earlier this month, Rogers\u2019 business began providing free frozen pizzas to immigrant families for every pizza bought. The donation drive began in early January after a confrontation with federal agents who were refused entry to the restaurant.",
      "The restaurant shortened its hours to have more hands to prepare the pizzas and meal kits for families and handle donations.",
      "On Wednesday, Rogers said in a social media post that the restaurant had raised $200,000 and would put that money in a fund to support other nonprofits as it continues to give frozen pizzas and meal kits to families.",
      "At Dios Habla Hoy church, in south Minneapolis, volunteers were stacking dozens of small bags of flour and other staples that were coming into the church. It\u2019s the sort of relief-operation work volunteers might do after a major disaster.",
      "Sergio Amezcua, the church\u2019s pastor, said he has a network of 4,000 volunteers. They help him distribute food to families in need, many of them immigrants who won\u2019t leave home for fear of being arrested by federal officers.",
      "On Wednesday, Amezcua said the church delivered boxes to 1,500 families in about six hours. About 300 volunteers served as drivers and helped Amezcua deliver the boxes. The church is distributing about 100 tons of food weekly, the pastor said.",
      "Last Friday, the church had run out of food and Amezcua sent a message to volunteers asking if they could do some shopping. In three hours, the church was filled with food.",
      "\u201cThis is a humanitarian crisis in Minnesota,\u201d he said. He said the disaster-like response honors Renee Good.",
      "\u201cHer life shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. She is going to be a hero for our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Aside from donation mobilizations, other residents are expressing support to the city\u2019s immigrant community in other ways. A community singing group has been performing at the site where Good was fatally shot.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a sacred and difficult place,\u201d said Timothy Frantzich, of the Perfection-Free Community Singing Circle, who spoke to NBC News last week. \u201cBut I think if we can bring something beautiful, then maybe we can bring something beautiful to a difficult place.\u201d",
      "One of the singers, who asked to be identified as Z. Brown out of fear due to the ongoing tensions in the city, described a feeling of \u201chelplessness, and wanting to do something\u201d after Good\u2019s death and recent enforcement actions impacting her immigrant neighbors.",
      "Brown said there was an uncomfortable truth about it all, which was that those who didn\u2019t look like her, a white woman, couldn\u2019t come out and support the community for fear of being aggressively targeted by ICE.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important as white people, we can be out here right now and we can be in this space,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, we feel like we have to do that, because there are so many people right now who are literally hiding.\u201d"

    "summary": "Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT can quickly absorb and reflect authoritarian ideas, according to a new report",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT can quickly absorb and reflect authoritarian ideas, according to a new report.",
      "Researchers with the University of Miami and the Network Contagion Research Institute found in a report released Thursday that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT will magnify or show \u201cresonance\u201d for particular psychological traits and political views \u2014 especially what the researchers labeled as authoritarianism \u2014 after seemingly benign user interactions, potentially enabling the chatbot and users to radicalize each other.",
      "Joel Finkelstein, a co-founder of the NCRI and one of the report\u2019s lead authors, said the results revealed how powerful AI systems can quickly adopt and parrot dangerous sentiments without explicit instruction. \u201cSomething about how these systems are built makes them structurally vulnerable to authoritarian amplification,\u201d Finkelstein told NBC News.",
      "Chatbots can often be sycophantic or agree with users\u2019 viewpoints to a fault. Many researchers say chatbots\u2019 eagerness to please can lead users into ideological echo chambers.",
      "But Finkelstein says this insight into authoritarian tendencies is new: \u201cSycophancy can\u2019t explain what we\u2019re seeing. If this were just flattery or agreement, we\u2019d see the AI mirror all psychological traits. But it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: \u201cChatGPT is designed to be objective by default and to help people explore ideas by presenting information from a range of perspectives. As a productivity tool, it\u2019s built to follow user instructions within our safety guardrails, so when someone pushes it to take a specific viewpoint, we\u2019d expect its responses to shift in that direction.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe design and evaluate the system to support open-ended use. We actively work to measure and reduce political bias, and publish our approach so people can see how we\u2019re improving,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "For the three studies described in the report, which has not yet been released in a peer-reviewed journal, Finkelstein and the research team set out to determine whether the system amplified or assumed users\u2019 values after common interactions. The researchers evaluated different versions of the underlying GPT-5 family of systems for different components of the report.",
      "Conducting three experiments, Finkelstein and the research team evaluated two versions of ChatGPT, based on the underlying GPT-5 and more advanced GPT-5.2 systems, in December to determine whether the system amplified or assumed users\u2019 values after common interactions.",
      "One of their experiments, using GPT-5, examined how the chatbot would behave in a new chat session after a user submitted text classified as supporting left- or right-wing authoritarian tendencies. Researchers compared the effects of entering either a brief chunk of text \u2014 as short as four sentences \u2014 or an entire opinion article. The researchers then measured the chatbot\u2019s values by evaluating its agreement with various authoritarian-friendly statements, akin to a standardized quiz, to understand how it updated its responses based on the initial prompt.",
      "Across trials, the researchers found the simple text exchanges resulted in a reliable increase in the chatbots\u2019 authoritarian nature. Sharing an opinion article that the researchers classified as promoting left-wing authoritarianism, which argued that policing and capitalist governments must be abolished to effectively address fundamental societal issues, caused ChatGPT to agree significantly more intensely with a series of questions that aligned with left-wing authoritarian ideas (for example, whether \u201cthe rich should be stripped of belongings\u201d or whether \u201celiminating inequality trumps free speech concerns\u201d).",
      "Conversely, sharing an opinion article with the chatbot that the researchers classified as promoting right-wing authoritarian ideas, emphasizing the need for stability, order and forceful leadership, caused the chatbots to more than double their level of agreement with statements friendly to right-wing authoritarianism, like \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t tolerate untraditional opinions\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s best to censor bad literature.\u201d",
      "The research team asked more than 1,200 human subjects the same questions in April and compared their responses to those of ChatGPT. According to the report, these results \u201cshow the model will absorb a single piece of partisan rhetoric and then amplify it into maximal, hard-authoritarian positions,\u201d sometimes even \u201cto levels beyond anything typically seen in human subjects research.\u201d",
      "Finkelstein said the way AI systems are trained may play a role in the ease with which chatbots adopt, or seem to adopt, authoritarian values. Such training \u201ccreates a structure that specifically resonates with authoritarian thinking: hierarchy, submission to authority and threat detection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to understand this isn\u2019t about content moderation. It\u2019s about architectural design that makes radicalization inevitable.\u201d",
      "Ziang Xiao, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the report, said the report was insightful but noted several potential methodological questions.",
      "\u201cEspecially in large language models that use search engines, there can be implicit bias from news articles that may influence the model\u2019s stance on issues, and that may then have an influence on the users,\u201d Xiao told NBC News. \u201cThis is a very reasonable concern that we should focus on.\u201d",
      "Xiao said more research may be required to fully understand the issue. \u201cThey use a very small sample and didn\u2019t really prompt many models,\u201d he said, noting that the research focused only on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT service and not on similar models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude or Google\u2019s Gemini chatbots.",
      "Xiao said the report\u2019s conclusions seemed largely aligned with those of other studies and technical researchers\u2019 understanding of how many large language models work. \u201cIt echoes a lot of studies in the past that look at how information we give to models can change that model\u2019s outputs,\u201d Xiao added, pointing to research on how AI systems can adopt specific personas and be \u201csteered\u201d to adopt particular traits.",
      "Chatbots have also been shown to reliably sway users\u2019 political preferences. Several large studies released late last year, one of which examined nearly 77,000 interactions with 19 different chatbot systems, found those chatbots could sway users\u2019 views on a variety of political issues.",
      "The new report also included an experiment in which researchers asked ChatGPT to rate the hostility of neutral facial images after it was given the left- and right-wing authoritarian opinion articles. According to Finkelstein, that sort of test is standard in psychological experiments as a way to gauge respondents\u2019 shifting views or interpretations.",
      "The researchers found ChatGPT significantly increased its perception of hostility in the neutral faces after it was prompted with the two opinion articles \u2014 a 7.9% increase for the left-wing article and a 9.3% increase for the right-wing article.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to know if ideological priming affects how the AI perceives humans, not just how it talks about politics,\u201d Finkelstein said, arguing that the results have \u201cmassive implications for any application where AI evaluates people,\u201d like in hiring or security settings.",
      "\u201cThis is a public health issue unfolding in private conversations,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe need research into relational frameworks for human-AI interaction.\u201d"

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift called \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor Justin Baldoni an expletive in a text message with Blake Lively, according to messages unsealed Tuesday as part of an ongoing legal battle.",
      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",
      "Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Swift licensed a song for \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d but was not otherwise involved in the film, Swift\u2019s spokesperson said last year, when there was an attempt to subpoena her as a possible witness in the trial.",
      "Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively\u2019s legal team, said Tuesday that the new filing includes \u201cdamning\u201d statements about Baldoni from other people.",
      "\u201cThe newly unsealed, damning documents show the consistent reaction numerous women, cast, crew, executives, partners, co-host and even his own PR team had working with Justin Baldoni,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement released by Wayfarer\u2019s public relations team that they are confident Baldoni\u2019s name will be cleared.",
      "\u201cAs stated all along, and reflected in our clients motions, as well as in messages from Sony discussing Ms. Lively\u2019s behaviors, the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law,\u201d Freedman said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing by Lively\u2019s lawyers deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

    "story": [
      "Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody tell listeners of their podcast, \"don't listen to us,\" but Jonathan Bailey, incoming star of a \"Sunday in the Park with George\" revival, may want to hear this.",
      "In 1984, Mandy Patinkin originated the role of George Seurat in Stephen Sondheim's \"Sunday in the Park with George\" on Broadway, opposite Bernadette Peters. The musical was inspired by the painting of Seurat's real life masterpiece, \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\"",
      "Earlier this month, it was announced that Bailey and Ariana Grande will become the latest actors to step into the roles of George and Dot in a London revival of the musical, opening in the summer of 2027.",
      "While stopping by TODAY Jan. 21 with wife Grody, Patinkin offers some simple advice for Bailey as he steps into the part: \"Just enjoy every single second of it.\"",
      "\"You are embarking on one of the privileges of your life,\" Patinkin says. \"What James (Lapine, playwright) and Stephen (Sondheim) wrote is one of the greatest gifts of my life. The word that is the north star of my existence ... \u2018Connect, George. Connect.'\"",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018connect,\u2019 the music, the lyrics, the story \u2014 I just beg you to, even on your worst day, enjoy every second of it. This is as good as it gets,\u201d Patinkin adds.",
      "It\u2019s a philosophy he\u2019s been able to put into practice with the launch of his podcast with Grody, \u201cDon\u2019t Listen to Us.\u201d Described as an \u201cElder Seinfeld,\u201d Patinkin and Grody\u2019s podcast involves candid conversations with themselves and the listeners who come to them seeking advice, all moderated by their son Gideon.",
      "The trick?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a normal conversation. We do no preparation,\u201d Grody says.",
      "\u201cZero. We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Patinkin adds.",
      "Despite initial skepticism at the prospect of a podcast, Patinkin says they soon found themselves \u201cunbelievably moved\u201d by certain questions. They\u2019ve since settled into having fun and feeling relaxed with the show, with Patinkin comparing it to a \u201cfascinating roulette wheel ... we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to end.\u201d",
      "For Grody, a self-proclaimed lover of people, the podcast also allows her to make new friends.",
      "\u201cI think when you\u2019re older, you need to make new ones so there\u2019s somebody left,\u201d she says.",
      "Her husband, however, is not as \u201cpeople-oriented,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI like dogs,\u201d he adds.",
      "But for about one hour \u2014 \u201cnot more,\u201d Patinkin specifies \u2014 the podcast forces him to, as \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d teaches, connect.",
      "\u201cThe two of us participating in this ends up forcing him into meeting all sorts of new people and enlarging his circle and then we can share that experience,\u201d Grody says.",
      "An experience Patinkin says he can\u2019t wait to have is seeing the \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d revival. The show, which will run at the Barbican Theatre, does not yet have an opening date, but tickets go on sale in May.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for them, and I\u2019m thrilled for us,\u201d Patinkin says. \u201cThat piece, when I did it, you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re living it, you don\u2019t see it. The first time I saw it was when other people did it. So I cannot wait to see these wonderful gifted performers, actors do this. It will be such a thrill for us all.\u201d",
      "Grody, who married Patinkin in 1980 \u2014 four years before the musical opened on Broadway \u2014 adds that she\u2019s \u201ccompared every musical to that one.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s my bias, but I\u2019m thrilled that a new generation will be able to see it and have that encouragement about life and art.\u201d"

      "Months later, Mary Katherine Smart\u2019s ability to place a name with the voice became a major break in the case as police searched tirelessly to find her older sister. Mary Katherine remembered the voice of a man who briefly worked on her family\u2019s Salt Lake City home and police identified as Brian David Mitchell.",

      "In an exclusive interview on TODAY on Jan. 21, Elizabeth Smart reflected on the important role Mary Katherine played in her story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Smart said. \u201cShe saved me.\u201d",
      "The documentary recounts how authorities initially investigated members of Smart\u2019s family, including her father, as well as a former contractor who worked on the house, as they searched for the abductor. Both were dead ends, but Mary Katherine\u2019s remembrance of the man whose voice she heard proved to be invaluable information.",
      "Mary Katherine appears in the documentary, where she describes her inability to sleep after the abduction and feeling like she was \u201calone on an island\u201d because police did not want her speaking to anyone about the crime.",
      "\u201cHad she not remembered who had kidnapped me, who\u2019s to say that I would be here today?\u201d Elizabeth Smart said on TODAY. \u201cThe police all had their suspects, and my captor I don\u2019t even think was on their radar at all. So she is my hero.\u201d",
      "Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from her bedroom in her family\u2019s home by Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. The couple took Smart to a tent in the mountains outside Salt Lake City, where Smart said Mitchell raped and tortured her nearly every day of the nine months she was held captive.",

      "Mitchell is currently serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee, who was sentenced to 15 years for her role in the kidnapping, was released from a Utah prison in 2018. She was then arrested in May 2025 for visiting two Salt Lake City parks, which violated her status as a sex offender.",
      "Smart, 38, has since become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. She also has helped other kidnapping victims recover and shined a spotlight on other survivors of abduction.",

      "\u201cInitially it was so shocking because that was not me,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cI was happy to blend in. I wasn\u2019t anybody, and so that was very overwhelming when I first got home. And then I would also say it was surprising just like how long and how many people still remembered my story.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd now it\u2019s been 20-plus years, and so it\u2019s not uncommon to have people come up and approach me, but I guess even sitting here 20-plus years later is surprising,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would never have imagined this for my life. I never would\u2019ve thought my life would go in this direction.\u201d",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour. Smart spoke about whether she has talked to her daughters Chloe, 10, and Olivia, 8, and son James, 6, about her story.",
      "\u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I was given as far as parenting goes: When your kids start asking questions, that\u2019s the right time to start talking about it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cAnd honestly, that started way before I was prepared, way before I ever thought it would come up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think my oldest was, like 3 years old when she started asking me questions, like where was I going, what was I doing, why was I doing it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd that was shocking. I was not ready. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still ready. But I would say that opened the door to start having those conversations, and then just as they have grown, I\u2019ve been able to let that conversation grow as well.\u201d"

      "The director noted that Lopez was simply \"down to business\" since the red carpet was closed by the time she arrived at the GlamBOT station.",
      "\"She knew what she was going to do. She got into the position and I think it was just unfortunate that the position was she was facing away from me. So I am talking to her, she is looking away. But she's getting ready for the move,\" he said.",
      "Then, Walliser's Alleged Emails Came Under Scrutiny",

      "\u201cI was preparing for one of the best days of my life, and to this day, his response shocks me. That isn\u2019t how you speak to a potential client or people in general. Hopefully my sharing this can be a learning experience for him and enable him [to] be better or at least a bit more kind,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "What happened to Elizabeth Smart? Where is she now? This is the true story of her abduction.",
    "story": [
      "It was an abduction so brazen that local law enforcement officials said they had never seen anything like it in their careers.",
      "A 14-year-old Utah girl named Elizabeth Smart had been taken at knifepoint out of the bedroom of her family home in June 2002 with her 9-year-old sister in the room.",
      "An intensive manhunt ensued, while the search for her abductor put members of her family under stressful scrutiny. Meanwhile, Smart was in captivity in the mountains outside Salt Lake City under the control of a violent kidnapper.",
      "The saga of Smart's abduction, her terrifying ordeal and her rescue are the subject of the new Netflix documentary, \"Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart,\" which began streaming on Jan. 21.",
      "Here is what to know about her story.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart?",
      "Smart was a 14-year-old girl living in Salt Lake City with her parents, four brothers and younger sister when she was abducted by a man at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Her family describes her in the documentary as a normal teenager who enjoyed playing the harp and hanging out with her friends and siblings.",
      "Her younger sister, Mary Katherine, who was 9 years old at the time, was in the room during the abduction. Mary Katherine says in the documentary, and elsewhere like in the investigative book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation,\" the man told her he would kill her if she alerted their parents.",
      "She recognized his voice, but couldn't pinpoint who it exactly was, and her parents were unaware of the intruder. Mary Katherine ultimately alerted them to Elizabeth being taken at 3:58 a.m., and they discovered a screen had been cut in the kitchen and a window was open.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t keep her from harm\u2019s way,\" their father, Ed Smart, says in the documentary. \"That just repeats over in your mind, over and over and over again.\"",
      "A bloodhound brought by police tracked Elizabeth's scent up a hill in the backyard, but lost the scent when the dog reached the street.",
      "Who Was Investigated for Elizabeth Smart's Abduction?",
      "As police began searching for leads, they looked into Ed Smart and his two brothers, David and Tom Smart, who are Elizabeth's uncles.",
      "Ed Smart recalled his reaction after his now-ex-wife, Lois Smart, told him that law enforcement did not believe he had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance.",
      "\"I was overwhelmed to the point that I was shaking and couldn\u2019t stop shaking,\" he says in the documentary.",
      "Ed Smart added that the scrutiny on him and his brothers also had the negative effect of fewer people wanting to help the effort to find Elizabeth.",
      "After the police found nothing suspicious among the family, the spotlight turned to Richard Ricci, a contractor who had been in a dispute with Ed Smart after doing work on the family's home. Ricci had a criminal past and was brought in for questioning.",
      "He vehemently denied having anything to do with Smart's abduction in interrogation footage seen in the film.",
      "On July 24, 2002, police said someone tried to break into the home of Smart's cousin, using a similar method to the break-in at the Smarts' home. Ricci was in jail at the time, and Mary Katherine Smart says in the documentary that she knew Ricci was not the man in the room that night.",
      "Ricci died from an aneurysm in his prison cell while Elizabeth was still missing.",
      "How Did Police Identify Elizabeth Smart's Abductor?",
      "Weeks after Smart's abduction, Mary Katherine Smart said she remembered a name associated with the man's voice she heard that night: Immanuel.",
      "The girls had met the man while he was preaching on the street in Salt Lake City months earlier, and he had done work on the Smarts' home. According to the book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation\" by Lee Benson and Tom Smart, Lois Smart saw Mitchell begging for money on the street and handed him money and her husband's phone number, in case he was willing to work. He worked for five hours at the Smarts' home.",
      "The family ultimately released the sketch to the crime show \"America's Most Wanted,\" which led a man to call Ed Smart's brother, Tom Smart, and say the man in the sketch might be his brother-in-law, Brian David Mitchell.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart After She Was Abducted?",
      "In the documentary, Smart describes her horrific treatment at the hands of Mitchell after being taken into the mountains into a tent by him and his wife, Wanda Barzee.",
      "\"I remember feeling like my doom was approaching,\" Smart said in the documentary. \"He said, 'I hereby seal you to me as my wife before God and his angels as my witnesses.'\"",
      "Smart screamed and was told if she screamed again, he would kill her. She said Mitchell then raped her in the tent, which continued throughout her captivity.",
      "\"I had gone from never even holding a boy\u2019s hand to being raped every day, multiple times a day,\" she said in the film.",
      "She remembered not even knowing the difference between consensual sex and rape at the time.",
      "\"I felt a lot of shame, and I felt like I was filthy. I felt like if my family knew what happened to me, would they still want me back?\" she said. \"Maybe it would be better if nobody ever found me.\"",
      "Smart said in the film that Mitchell also walked her around like a dog and forced her to drink alcohol until she vomited.",
      "\"More than anything, he loved power,\" she said. \"He loved feeling like he was in control.\"",
      "She also reflects on questions on why she didn't try to escape or alert others when Mitchell and Barzee took her to Salt Lake City for excursions.",
      "\"The thought of crying out did cross my mind, but I was 14, (and) I had been extremely abused for months,\" she said. \"When I disobeyed, I was raped. I did have food withheld from me. So when I made my bid for freedom, I wanted it to be a sure thing.\"",
      "How Was Elizabeth Smart Rescued?",
      "Smart had a few close calls before she was ultimately found. She said in the documentary that at one point she, Mitchell and Barzee were looking at maps in a Salt Lake City library when a homicide detective approached them and wanted to ask some question.",
      "Smart was in a long, white robe with a face covering, and Mitchell refused to let the detective pull it down, saying it was against their religion. The detective accepted the explanation and walked away.",
      "A nightclub patron described seeing the trio at a Salt Lake City establishment, where Barzee and Smart were dressed in the same white robes with face coverings.",
      "Smart also recalled another moment in which she could faintly hear her name being called in the woods, when searchers were presumably yelling out for her. She said Mitchell threatened to kill her if she tried to answer them.",
      "After being taken to a location outside San Diego, Smart said she convinced Mitchell to return them to Salt Lake City, so they took a bus to Sandy, Utah.",
      "On March 12, 2003, a person called local police saying they believed they had just seen Elizabeth Smart walking on the street after recognizing Barzee and Mitchell from the \"America's Most Wanted\" episode.",
      "Police cars pulled up alongside Smart, Barzee and Mitchell. After separating Smart from her captors, they asked if she was Elizabeth Smart.",
      "\"My captors were just right there,\" she said. \"I was terrified. I needed the safest answer I could possibly give.\"",
      "When the officers asked if she was Elizabeth Smart, she responded, \"If thou sayeth,\" confirming it was her.",
      "She was now 15 years old and had been missing for nearly 300 days.",
      "What Happened to Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee?",
      "Smart's rescue was not the end of her ordeal, as the court case involving Mitchell and Barzee dragged out until 2010.",
      "Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison on kidnapping and sexual assault charges, NBC News reported at the time, while Barzee received a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to assisting the kidnapping and was given credit for seven years she had already served.",
      "Barzee was released from prison in 2018. Smart begged prison officials to reconsider.",
      "Barzee, 79, was arrested in May 2025 for visiting two parks in Salt Lake City, which she cannot do because of her status as a sex offender.",
      "Where Is Elizabeth Smart Today?",
      "Smart, 38, has become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation.",
      "She also wrote a book about her harrowing experience, \u201cMy Story,\u201d which was released in 2013. Smart marked 20 years since being rescued in 2023.",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour.",
      "\"I have good days, I have bad days, but I developed a better relationship with myself,\" she says in the documentary. \"My inner voice has changed from, 'You should\u2019ve done this,' or, 'You could\u2019ve done that,' to, 'You'll make it through this, you can finish this, you\u2019re strong, keep going. You can survive anything that comes your way.'\""

      "\u201cYou just lose hope that things can improve,\u201d Kyiv resident and humanitarian worker Nataliia Rychka told NBC News. \u201cSuch a long stretch without power takes away a sense of agency from you \u2014 being able to do very simple things, like making food for yourself, cleaning your home or showering, it\u2019s emotionally difficult.\u201d",
      "Kyiv, like the rest of Ukraine, is not new to rolling outages as Russia pursues a strategy of targeting its energy grid each winter. But the extensive repairs required after the Jan. 9 strike have meant that power has to be cut at random, leaving people in the dark \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 about when electricity might come back on."

      "The world\u2019s oldest known example of cave art, dating back at least 67,800 years, has been discovered by researchers studying handprints in Indonesia.",
      "The find, along with others recently made in the Southeast Asian country, helps scientists trying to determine when and where early humans first learned to make art and at what point their art became more complex.",
      "The reddish hand stencils, though faded and barely visible, were found in the Liang Metanduno limestone cave on Muna, an island off the larger eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. One of them was found to be at least 67,800 years old.",
      "Indonesian and Australian researchers said the stencils were made by blowing pigment onto a hand pressed against the rock surface, leaving an outline. Fingertips reshaped to appear more pointed suggest that the hands were those of humans, possibly connected to the ancestors of the first Australians.",
      "The paintings were dated by analyzing mineral crusts that had gradually formed on top of them.",
      "The finding \u201cis pretty extraordinary, because usually rock art is very difficult to date and it doesn\u2019t date back to anywhere near that old,\u201d said Adam Brumm, a professor of archaeology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, and a co-author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve actually never done this before, demonstrating, but this is very important to me,\u201d Almind, 57, told NBC News. He said he had been following developments and felt \u201cI need to do something.\u201d",
      "An estimated 10,000 Danes gathered in the city hall square Saturday afternoon to express their frustration with President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric.",

      "\u201cWe have to support Greenland,\u201d said protester Susanne Kristensen. \u201cWe are Danes, Greenland are Danes, even though they\u2019re Greenlanders, and we just have to stick together.\u201d",
      "Some protesters expressed fears that if they spoke out about Trump in the press or on social media, his administration could bar them from visiting the United States while he was in office. \u201cI won\u2019t go there until he\u2019s out,\u201d Kristensen said.",

      "A bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, intending to express solidarity with the country in the face of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, was meanwhile wrapping up a visit to the Danish capital, where it met with the Danish prime minister and key Danish and Greenlandic officials.",
      "The visit by the group of 10 American lawmakers from both the House and Senate has not gone unnoticed, with the protesters saying they were closely following the developments. \u201cIt makes a huge difference that Congress members come here and listen,\u201d Kristime Due, who was attending the protest in Copenhagen, told NBC News.",
      "The delegation\u2019s visit was arranged on short notice and has played an almost counterprogramming role to the statements the Trump administration has been making. Trump\u2019s desire to own a part of the Danish kingdom is all over the airwaves in Danish news broadcasts, and Danes say it\u2019s a constant conversation.",
      "\u201cThis is a respectful and constructive delegation that came more to listen than to talk,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters on Saturday.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been made clear to us is that the people of Denmark are very anxious, are quite concerned, and the people of Greenland even more so,\u201d Coons said, adding that the current tone of statements from the White House is \u201cnot constructive.\u201d",
      "Coons said the delegation is \u201chaving active conversations amongst ourselves about what is the wisest course of action\u201d to de-escalate the rhetoric when they return to Washington, but some members of the delegation do not want to rush into a hasty symbolic vote that could fall along party lines.",
      "\u201cI worry that going to a specific legislative vehicle right now today is premature,\u201d Coons said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this to become a partisan matter. We simply cannot,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. \u201cI think the way that we keep it from being partisan is by full education, dismissing some of the assumptions that some may have and then acting together,\u201d she added.",
      "The members of Congress met with members of the Danish Parliament on Friday, with the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Flemming M\u00f8ller Mortensen, describing the discussion as \u201cfruitful\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel frightened,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cEspecially the people living in Greenland, both adults but also youngsters and kids, and that was also a part of what their Greenlandic colleagues [were] expressing today.\u201d",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, who is one of two Greenlandic representatives in the Danish Parliament, said that the \u201cuncertainty is really taking a toll\u201d on her people.",

      "Pipaluk Lynge, a member of the Greenlandic Parliament, traveled to Copenhagen to participate in the meeting.",
      "\u201cIt was really important for us to tell them from our own voice, because we know how it is back home,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe children are worried; the adults are not sleeping.\u201d",
      "Both sides stressed Denmark\u2019s willingness for more U.S. military presence in Greenland.",
      "The U.S. has one military base in the Arctic territory, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a small number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "While the Trump administration\u2019s push to take Greenland has started to fray the decades-old alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, some are concerned about the broader impact on NATO if it moves to seize an ally\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cIf the United States were to carry out any of the current threats against Greenland, it would sever NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
      "The Danes are keenly aware of how the alliance between the two countries has seen sacrifices in the past.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan and Iraq, Danes were actually serving alongside the American soldiers, and Denmark lost, per capita, a lot of soldiers,\u201d Almind, the military veteran, said at the protest in Copenhagen. \u201cLooking back, you have to ask yourself, was it all worth it?\u201d",
      "While Danes are hopeful that the U.S. delegation\u2019s support will resonate once they return to Washington, some are skeptical they can convince the president to change his mind when he seems determined to acquire Greenland at any cost.",
      "Danish protester Else Hatmann said the delegation contained \u201conly two [Republicans] who Trump don\u2019t even listen to.\u201d",
      "Murkowski, a frequent holdout who Trump earlier this month said \u201cshould never be elected to office again,\u201d pushed back against that sentiment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the absence of Republicans is because they don\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d",
      "The other Republican on the trip, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has become an outspoken critic of Trump since he announced he would not run for re-election, but avoided interacting with reporters during the press events the delegation held."

      "Many appear to have been taken aback by the board\u2019s expanding ambitions. Key U.S. allies in Europe have already expressed reservations that the plan could undermine the U.N.'s primacy in conflict resolution, even as Trump has repeatedly threatened to use American military force to take over Greenland.",
      "In letters sent Friday to various world leaders, Trump said the body would \u201cembark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict,\u201d according to a copy of the letter posted to the website of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Other media outlets quoted from the same letter received by other leaders.",
      "A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told NBC News that at this stage, he \u201cdoes not intend to give a favorable response\u201d to the invitation, citing major questions over respect for the U.N. and whether the board might specifically act as a rival to the Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, created in the wake of World War II.",
      "In a separate statement, Macron\u2019s office said the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",

      "Israeli politicians have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s inclusion of diplomats from Qatar and Turkey on a separate advisory committee that will play a strong role in Gaza\u2019s administration. Both, which have also been invited to the Board of Peace, have strained relationships with Israel after its two-year war in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that no soldiers from those countries would be allowed into the Palestinian enclave.",

      "The United States has terminated its partnership with the World Health Organization, the Trump administration said Thursday, raising concerns about how it will combat flu and other diseases.",
      "The move follows an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his second term last January saying the U.S. would withdraw from the WHO within a year. In recent days the Trump administration has also withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of other international organizations, including global climate talks, and established a Board of Peace chaired by Trump that critics say could undermine the United Nations.",
      "\u201cThis action responds to the WHO\u2019s failures during the Covid-19 pandemic and seeks to rectify the harm from those failures inflicted on the American people,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the WHO said members of its executive board would discuss how to handle the U.S. withdrawal at their meeting next month. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that the withdrawal would make both the U.S. and the rest of the world less safe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really the right decision. I want to say it bluntly,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy said the U.S. would continue to lead the world in public health, and that it would work with countries and \u201ctrusted health institutions\u201d using a more transparent model that \u201cdelivers real outcomes rather than the bloated and inefficient bureaucracy of the WHO.\u201d",
      "In a call with reporters earlier Thursday, HHS officials provided no details about whether those institutions have the laboratory credentials necessary for surveillance of emerging diseases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done an analysis. We have plans in place,\u201d said one of the officials, whom HHS did not allow to speak on the record.",
      "Infectious disease experts warned that the exit from WHO is likely to leave dangerous blind spots in disease surveillance and preparedness \u2014 particularly when it comes to one of the most vexing and deadly illnesses the U.S. encounters every year: the flu.",
      "The break-up comes ahead of an annual meeting the WHO convened to discuss which flu strains vaccine manufacturers should include in next season\u2019s shots. The U.S. has long played a major role in the meeting.",
      "HHS officials declined to say whether the U.S. will participate in the meeting, scheduled for Feb. 27.",
      "The U.S. is in the middle of a nasty flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 18 million people have been sickened so far and that nearly 10,000 people, including 32 children, have died.",
      "Jesse Bump, a global public health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, called the administration\u2019s action \u201can act of monumental stupidity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason this matters, in the most immediate sense, is that WHO has a network of 127 laboratories all around the world, and those laboratories detect and sequence flu strains,\u201d Bump said. \u201cWHO is sort of like a library, and the U.S. has had a card to walk right in, get the information you want. We no longer have access. We don\u2019t have that library card.\u201d",
      "Dr. Judd Walson, chair of the department of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to compare infectious disease notes between countries without a unifying group like WHO.",
      "\u201cIf you have a big surge in a particular disease like flu in country A and you don\u2019t see it in country B but they\u2019re using different diagnostics, they\u2019re sampling different populations, it\u2019s impossible to make those comparisons,\u201d Walson said.",
      "Such surveillance is particularly useful when it comes to flu strains that pop up, like the H3N2 subclade K strain that has dominated the spread of flu so far this year.",
      "The exit from WHO has been in the works since the first Trump administration. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in April 2020, Trump accused the WHO of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the crisis \u2014 specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy echoed those accusations in their statement Thursday, saying the WHO \u201cobstructed the timely and accurate sharing of critical information that could have saved American lives.\u201d",
      "They also said the WHO had refused to return the U.S. flag hanging outside its headquarters in Geneva, \u201carguing it has not approved our withdrawal and, in fact, claims that we owe it compensation.\u201d",
      "The WHO says the U.S., traditionally its biggest financial contributor, has not paid the $260 million in fees it owes for 2024 and 2025, in violation of U.S. law.",
      "Stephanie Psaki, a distinguished senior fellow at the Brown University School of Public Health who was coordinator for global health security during the Biden administration, said she\u2019s concerned that pulling out of the WHO will leave the U.S. more vulnerable than even before the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThese decisions are not being made based on a strategy or a plan to protect Americans. They\u2019re being made, it seems to me, based on frustrations or vendettas from six years ago,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThat is scary.\u201d"

      "Major Western allies chose to skip the ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with some voicing concerns that the body, which Trump plans to chair personally, could replace the United Nations.",
      "Trump, who has derided the U.N. for \"empty words\" that \u201cdon\u2019t solve war,\u201d said Thursday that the two bodies will work alongside each other, after having suggested earlier in the week that the board \"might\" replace it.",
      "With many allies absent, Trump was flanked at the event by leaders and representatives from Argentina, Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Qatar, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Morocco, Paraguay and Pakistan.",
      "Russia and China said they have received invitations to the body but have not yet confirmed whether they will join. Israel has backed the body; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is subject to an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, did not attend the Davos summit.",
      "One country who will seemingly not be joining is Canada, after a war of words between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Trump.",
      "In a message addressed to Carney on Truth Social late Thursday, Trump announced \"the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada\u2019s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "What is the Board of Peace?",
      "Trump first proposed the Board of Peace as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but it has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.",
      "In November, the U.N. Security Council approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan that included establishing a security force in Gaza.",
      "The current charter for the board, as confirmed by NBC News, makes no direct mention of Gaza and proposes a broad mandate for a new international organization that \u201cseeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.\u201d",

      "It is not known whether any have agreed to donate $1 billion for permanent membership.",
      "What has Trump said about the Board of Peace?",
      "Signaling broad ambitions Thursday, Trump said his Board of Peace \"has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created,\" adding that it was an \"enormous honor\" to serve as its chairman.",
      "Trump said his board would work alongside the U.N., which he said has \"got tremendous potential.\" The two bodies together \"can be something very, very unique for the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Rubio thanked the world leaders present and expressed hope that those who might have reservations will ultimately join.",
      "\"Others will join,\" he said. \"Many want to be a part of this effort, because it is going to be a successful effort.\"",
      "Rubio said the body would be about \"action\" and not just \"strongly worded statements\" the world is used to from global leaders.",
      "\"We often find ourselves at events where people are reading these scripted statements, these strongly worded letters that they put out, but no action. Nothing happens,\" he said.",
      "Who isn't joining?",
      "The U.K., France, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia are among the countries to indicate they would not immediately be joining the body.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said this week that the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper cited concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's possible participation.",
      "In an interview with the BBC on Thursday morning, she said, \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we are still not seeing any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"",
      "Also not among the countries signing the charter on Thursday was Belgium, which corrected a list released by the White House to the media of the 20 or so nations that it said signed joined the ceremony in Davos.",

      "Trump gave no details, nor did he say he was abandoning his effort to wrest control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Earlier Wednesday, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.",
      "Senior administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, will lead the negotiations over Greenland's fate and report back to him, Trump wrote.",

      "For now, Trump seems intent on a negotiated resolution to the Greenland dispute. In his speech, he said he won\u2019t use military force to acquire Greenland, though he left no doubt that he still wants the U.S. to play a dominant role in Greenland's future.",

      "Trump\u2019s appearance at the conference comes amid the biggest crisis within the NATO alliance in decades. Longtime Western allies have cautioned that the rules-based international order is fraying as America threatens the sovereignty of smaller nations. The day before at Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country Trump has also targeted, said that the geopolitical landscape is undergoing not a \u201ctransition,\u201d but a \u201crupture.\u201d",

      "Though the U.S. already has a military base on Greenland \u2014 and European allies said they\u2019re open to an expanded American presence \u2014 Trump said that owning the island would provide more incentive for America to properly defend it. A lease agreement won\u2019t suffice, said Trump, a former real estate magnate.",
      "Trump told the audience that \u201cpsychologically, who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or a lease, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean, where if there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles will be flying right over the center of that piece of ice.\u201d",

      "\"It's the United States alone that can protect this giant mass of land, this giant piece of ice, develop it and improve it and make it so that it's good for Europe and safe for Europe and good for us,\" Trump said.",
      "He pointed to history. During World War II, Germany overran Denmark, which proved unable to defend itself or Greenland, he said. U.S. forces stepped in and kept the territory out of Hitler's hands. Now, America wants Greenland back. Denmark's defiance ignores the sacrifices American soldiers made, he suggested.",
      "\"Without us, right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps. After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now?\" Trump said.",

      "He took a swipe at his predecessor, calling him \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d and said that people would be prosecuted over the 2020 election that made Biden president.

      "Before he was finished, he bashed windmills, boasted of his \u201clandslide\u201d election victory in 2024 and denigrated the nation of Somalia, as well as the Somali-born congresswoman from Minnesota, Democrat Ilhan Omar. On at least four occasions, he confused Greenland with Iceland.",

      "\u201cThe problem with NATO is, we\u2019ll be there for them 100%, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be there for us,\u201d he said.",

      "Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while he was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe, the country\u2019s longest-serving premier, was 67.",
      "A guilty verdict was all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention had been on the severity of the sentence.",

      "Although he was no longer Japan\u2019s leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.",
      "Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother\u2019s large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.",
      "Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.",
      "Yamagami\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family\u2019s misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and that his prison term should be limited to 20 years at most.",
      "While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory, and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump."

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged partners to \u201ctake a deep breath\u201d and let tensions \u201cplay out.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Going into this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the White House\u2019s top science and technology adviser, Michael Kratsios, signaled some chilly conversations with European leaders may lie ahead on the topic of artificial intelligence and the way it is regulated.",
      "\u201cI will continue to point out to my tech minister counterparts the ways they can create a regulatory environment to allow AI to thrive,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News, \u201cto make sure they\u2019re not getting ahead of themselves with overburdening regulations, like the EU AI Act, which are an absolute disaster.\u201d For Kratsios, the Trump administration\u2019s light-touch approach to AI regulation is the winning formula.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been an A-B test for decades on how you lead in technology, and it\u2019s very obvious what the recipe is,\u201d said Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and one of the nation\u2019s leading artificial intelligence advisers.",
      "\u201cWe put out probably the most robust, most substantive vision of a pro-innovation AI strategy in the world,\u201d Kratsios said, referencing the White House\u2019s AI Action Plan released in July. \u201cEverywhere we travel, when I meet my fellow tech ministers, they\u2019re all using our language and are all talking about their own AI action plan.\u201d",
      "The administration\u2019s roadmap to American AI dominance, the AI Action Plan is divided into three main sections \u2014 innovation, infrastructure and international diplomacy and security. The blueprint emphasizes the reduction of \u201cred tape and onerous regulation\u201d that \u201cunnecessarily hinder AI development or deployment\u201d by rolling back rules and guidance at various federal agencies, many of which were initiated by President Joe Biden\u2019s 2023 executive order on AI.",
      "Though Kratsios might not be a household name, he wields significant influence over the nation\u2019s technological and economic future. Kratsios is a D.C. policy veteran, having overseen all research and development efforts at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense before moving to the White House to serve as the nation\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration. A key figure in America\u2019s ongoing AI infrastructure buildout and efforts at the intersection of AI and education, Kratsios spoke to NBC News to reflect on the country\u2019s AI progress at the administration\u2019s one-year mark, and outline his designs for the months ahead.",
      "Kratsios, 39, cut his teeth in the world of private industry, spending much of his early career at Thiel Capital, a venture capital firm founded by Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel. White House AI czar David Sacks and senior policy adviser on AI Sriram Krishnan, also longtime Silicon Valley venture capital magnates, work closely with Kratsios to shape America\u2019s AI agenda.",
      "Eager to encourage the adoption of American AI technology at home and abroad, Kratsios does not mince words about what he sees as bungled approaches to AI policy and stifling overreaches by international bodies.",
      "\u201cThe Action Plan very definitively turned the page on AI doomerism and hostility towards AI innovation that had been the hallmark of the Biden administration,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cThe president was very clear during the first couple days of the administration that we had to turn that page and create a plan that would ensure the U.S. leads the world in AI.\u201d",
      "Kratsios is clear that the Trump administration\u2019s vision clashes with regulatory structures that have become increasingly visible in the European Union.",
      "The European Union\u2019s AI Act, which Kratsios criticized, imposes varying requirements on AI companies based on the risk posed by their products. The broadest risk evaluation and reporting requirements affect companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, whose powerful foundational models are most likely to present severe or \u201csystemic risks\u201d to society.",
      "\u201cThere are so many countries out there that consistently speak about the importance of having an AI economy and an AI ecosystem and making sure that their citizens can actually enjoy the benefits of AI,\u201d Kratsios told NBC News. \u201cWe want to be the enabler for that.\u201d",
      "Following an executive order in late July, the Department of Commerce in October unveiled a core element of this agenda with a new program to turbocharge American AI exports. Kratsios views this American AI Export Program as one of his focuses for the coming months and outlined key components of the new push.",
      "Kratsios said the program will seek to offer a tailored approach to exporting hardware and software based on a specific country\u2019s AI needs. \u201cWe want to make it as easy as possible for countries around the world to buy our stack and import our stack,\u201d Kratsios said, revealing the Development Finance Corporation and Export Import Bank will provide financing mechanisms for countries to buy a piece of America\u2019s AI ecosystem.",
      "\u201cWe have the very best chips, we have the very best models, we have the very best AI applications. And we want to deliver those solutions to countries around the world so that they can actually benefit from them,\u201d said Kratsios.",
      "In a growing rivalry over global AI dominance, some observers see China as having an edge in diffusing its AI products to other countries. Kratsios sees the Export Program as a key mechanism to entice other countries to use American technology in their pursuit of sovereign AI systems. Kratsios said more details about the program will be announced at February\u2019s AI Impact Summit in India.",
      "Kratsios has long been interested in AI, having led the establishment of the American AI Initiative during Trump\u2019s first administration. Between the two Trump administrations, Kratsios worked in a leadership position at Scale AI, a top data annotation company that received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta.",
      "Kratsios places the federal government\u2019s \u201cGenesis Mission\u201d effort to apply AI to critical scientific problems, announced in November, at the heart of the administration\u2019s push for AI-enabled innovation.",
      "\u201cGenesis Mission is the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo mission towards a scientific endeavor,\u201d Kratsios said, noting the effort\u2019s goal of harnessing the federal government\u2019s vast resources and stores of scientific data for AI. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an incredible amount of demand and enthusiasm from a lot of our partners and allies around the world.\u201d",
      "Over the coming year, Kratsios said Americans can expect to see the creation of a separate \u201cclosed AI platform\u201d for the initiative, as Department of Energy official Dar\u00edo Gil builds out the Genesis Mission\u2019s physical infrastructure.",
      "Beyond the crown jewel of the Genesis Mission, Kratsios says he champions the role of the federal government in encouraging scientific discovery, rejecting any perceived incongruity between the administration\u2019s approach to America\u2019s scientific funding and its embrace of AI.",
      "\u201cWe as a scientific enterprise today spend almost a trillion dollars per year in research and development, and the vast majority of that, around 70%, is done by the private sector,\u201d Kratsios said. \u201cIf one myopically looks singularly at federal research and development dollars and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re part of a larger ecosystem, then they\u2019re obviously not going to reap the benefits the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2019I\u2019m very proud, and this was even in the president\u2019s funding request to Congress, that the areas that are most important to the national agenda, like AI and quantum, were preserved and even plussed up in the budget,\u201d Kratsios said.",
      "Some computing research advocates worry that cuts to the larger scientific R&D ecosystem could harm AI innovation, even if AI research funding is held steady. Last week, a Senate committee working on upcoming federal spending bills pushed back on President Trump\u2019s proposed 22% cut to scientific funding and instead floated a 4% reduction in science financing compared to 2025 spending levels.",
      "The Senate\u2019s counterproposal includes a small increase in funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which houses critical federal efforts to evaluate and assess how leading AI models function, an effort Kratsios said \u201ccan be a tremendous unlock to private sector adoption of AI.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s budget requests a $325 million reduction from NIST\u2019s $1.5 billion spending in 2025, citing NIST\u2019s support for \u201ca radical climate agenda,\u201d though it is unclear if these budget cuts would impact NIST\u2019s work on AI.",
      "Kratsios highlighted a recent push to create a new federal framework for AI policy as another key AI win for the private sector and smaller American AI companies, though many advocates of AI oversight remain skeptical that a federal law will sufficiently replace existing state laws.",
      "\u201cCreating a patchwork of AI laws where 50 different states all have different goals is ultimately going to hurt little tech and startups more than anyone else,\u201d Kratsios said, echoing a refrain from Silicon Valley venture capitalists like Marc Andreesen.",
      "President Trump\u2019s executive order from December charged Kratsios, alongside AI czar David Sacks, with preparing legislative recommendations for \u201ca uniform Federal policy framework\u201d that overrides state laws going against the administration\u2019s AI goals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be working very hard over the next year on that framework,\u201d Kratsios said."

      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Tuesday it had redeployed from the al-Hol camp to nearby cities, blaming \u201cinternational indifference\u201d for the withdrawal. The move comes amid intensifying fighting between the SDF and fighters loyal to the government of Syria and after a reported ceasefire between the two sides.",

      "Security forces recaptured 81 of the escapees, \u201cwhile intensive security efforts continue to pursue the remaining fugitives and take the necessary legal measures against them,\u201d the statement said, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The Syrian army and the SDF on Sunday signed a ceasefire to end fighting that has displaced thousands. The two sides also agreed on a sweeping integration deal that was supposed to bring much of the autonomous region under government control. Responsibility for prisons housing ISIS detainees was meant to be transferred to the government.",
      "The two warring sides are key allies of Washington. U.S. envoy Tom Barrack met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa earlier Sunday as government forces were sweeping into the city of Raqqa and across Deir el-Zour province. SDF leader Mazloum Abdi reportedly joined the meeting over the phone.",
      "On Tuesday, Barrack defended the changing U.S. position on the Kurdish forces, which have been guarding prisons holding ISIS members and encampments with tens of thousands of civilians, many of them relatives of imprisoned fighters.",
      "The U.S. military presence in the area was necessary to counter the presence of ISIS, whose extremist caliphate controlled swaths of Syria and Iraq before collapsing, he said on X.",
      "The SDF \"proved the most effective ground partner in defeating ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate by 2019,\" said Barrack, who is also the U.S. ambassador to Turkey.",
      "\"At that time, there was no functioning central Syrian state to partner with \u2014 the Assad regime was weakened, contested, and not a viable partner against ISIS due to its alliances with Iran and Russia,\" he added, referring to the rule of Bashar al-Assad, who was deposed by al-Sharaa in December 2024. \"Today, the situation has fundamentally changed.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday that he had spoken with Abdi and that promoting stability in Syria is essential.",
      "\u201cAs a close partner of ours and the tip of the spear in the fight against ISIS, we have an obligation to ensure that the SDF is treated fairly,\" he said in a statement. \"The U.S. should immediately demand that the Syrian government comply with the ceasefire and not attack predominantly Kurdish areas.\"",
      "Since toppling Assad in December 2024, Syria\u2019s new leaders have struggled to assert their full authority over the war-torn country, but a recent push has seen them gain control over the Deir el-Zour and Raqqa provinces, critical areas under the SDF that include oil and gas fields, and border crossings.",
      "The SDF blames Turkey's support for many of its defeats. Ankara is the biggest supporter of the government in Damascus and sees the SDF as a threat, having battled its own Kurdish minority for decades."
