      "In the hit movie \u201cWicked,\u201d those famous magical shoes are silver",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the hit movie \u201cWicked,\u201d those famous magical shoes are silver. But if you want to see them in all their ruby-red glory from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d there\u2019s no place like home \u2014 their current home, that is, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.",
      "There, Dorothy\u2019s shoes, worn by Judy Garland, are now on display as part of a sweeping exhibit on the history of color in cinema. It\u2019s a history in which the sequined slippers play a key role.",
      "While the 1900 novel by Frank L. Baum described them as silver, filmmakers in 1939 wanted to pack as much color as possible into the scene where Dorothy steps from sepia-toned Kansas into the shimmering color of the Land of Oz, where Glinda gives her the shoes off the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East. They were showing off a new technology: Technicolor.",
      "The exhibit, \u201cColor in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema,\u201d running through July 13, is timely not only because everything Oz is new again.",
      "It also highlights the largely unsung role that women played in the development of color in Hollywood, not only on screen but off, where labor-intensive jobs like hand-coloring and stenciling gave them a foothold in a male-dominated industry.",
      "There's also a fanciful interactive installation where your own body creates cinematic explosions of color, on the spot.",
      "Here are some highlights:",
      "Those glistening slippers nestled against a wall \u2014 rather unobtrusively, given their iconic status \u2014 began their life as white silk pumps. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d costume designer Adrian (known by his first name) dyed them red and embellished them with nearly 5,000 sequins.",
      "One of four known pairs used for the film that still exist, they were secured with great fanfare and help from luminaries like Leonardo DiCaprio, and were displayed when the museum opened in September 2021.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the biggest treasures we have in our collection,\u201d says Jessica Niebel, curator of the color show. \u201cEver since they came down, we\u2019ve gotten regular visitor feedback asking to see the ruby red slippers back on display. This was the perfect opportunity.\u201d",
      "The shoes are silver in both Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and in Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d on which the Broadway show and movie are based.",
      "Some nine years after \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d another movie put a pair of red shoes front and center. They were ballet pointe shoes, and the film, fittingly, was \u201cThe Red Shoes.\u201d",
      "The sad story of a young ballerina forced to choose between her career and a romance, the movie , by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starred Moira Shearer, a real-life ballerina. Its tragic 17-minute dance sequence tells a story within a story \u2014 a young woman who dances in the red shoes until she dies.",
      "Curators placed these prized red pointe shoes front and center because, Niebel says, \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d highlights both the magical nature of red and the role color plays in the expression of physical movement through dance.",
      "Poignantly, the pointe shoes are not perfect, but worn \u2014 just as the character\u2019s white dress turns gray and dirty as she is gradually consumed.",
      "Silent films were in black and white, right?",
      "Well, no, actually. In this gallery, silent film excerpts show that many were in color. \u201cIn the 1920s, most films, 80-90%, we think, were in color,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cThey only became black and white with the arrival of sound.\u201d",
      "Before that, the majority of films where were tinted and toned, curators say, meaning an entire filmstrip is submerged in one color, often a bright one like yellow or pink or red or blue.",
      "Curators went to four film archives in Europe and the U.S. and scanned their filmstrips. \u201cIn this gallery, for the first time, you can see how these colors authentically looked in the 1920s without any digital manipulation,\u201d Niebel says.",
      "Another section describes a phenomenon many know nothing about: leader ladies. These were women who appeared in the lead frame of a film reel to be processed in a color lab. They were invisible to audiences, but used to calibrate and process the color in a film.",
      "The display raises the issue that this process, which has disappeared with the digital age, largely excluded people of color.",
      "\u201cPredominantly they used to be white women,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cSo film stock and film materials were calibrated towards white skin predominantly. We wanted to tell this story as well \u2014 the story of these women who are never named, who the public never saw, but also the story of how film stock was developed particularly to depict white skin.\u201d",
      "The show begins with images of Lo\u00efe Fuller and the Serpentine Dance she invented, where colored light was reflected onto a flowing costume, changing the colors. An American dancer, Fuller experimented in the early 20th century with fabric, movement, and color techniques like gels and chemical salts.",
      "But many other women toiled in obscurity. There were, for example, the women at Disney, as the studio made a transition to color. We learn that under the leadership of Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell, the studio's ink and paint department became the animation industry\u2019s first all-female unit.",
      "And the French production company Path\u00e9 employed young women to hand-paint films \u2014 frame by frame \u2014 early in the 20th century. These young women earned less than their male counterparts. Still, it was more than they were able to earn in other professions.",
      "As kids know from finger painting, there\u2019s nothing more fun than making color yourself \u2014 especially color that moves. That\u2019s the takeaway from a final gallery in which your own physical movement creates cascades of color.",
      "\u201cBody Paint,\u201d by artist Memo Akten, allows you to stand in front of a screen, spread your arms, jump up and down or move any which way you want as a camera translates the moves into color.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time for visitors to become animators of colors themselves through their own bodies,\u201d Niebel says. She's seen people stop and perform full-on dances at the installation.",
      "\u201cIt seems to bring people together,\u201d she says."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve written a novel about a quest, a crime, revenge, fame, a tangled love affair, mental illness, love of nature and poetry, and how, through all natural and self-inflicted catastrophes, we have the knack of surviving,\" McEwan said in a statement released Friday through Alfred A.

      "The 76-year-old McEwan has previously imagined disasters and disruptions \u2014 and how we respond \u2014 whether the threat of climate change in \u201cSolar,\u201d a radiation cloud in \u201cLessons\u201d or artificial intelligence in \u201cMachines Like Me.\u201d Knopf publisher and editor-in-chief Jordan Pavlin said in a statement that \u201cWhat We Can Know\u201d is an exploration of the \u201climits of our knowledge,\" whether of other people or the arc of the past.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky 's lawyers will make their case and try to establish a counternarrative Friday at his trial in Los Angeles, where the hip-hop star and fashion mogul is charged with firing a gun at a former friend on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "They plan to call to the stand rapper A$AP Twelvyy, who, like both the defendant and the man he's charged with shooting, was a member of the A$AP Mob, a group of young artists and creators that formed at a New York high school nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Twelvyy was one of two members of the crew who accompanied Rocky to a meetup with A$AP Relli, with whom he had a long-simmering beef that came to a head, he said, when Rocky fired a gun at him.",
      "Twelvyy is expected to testify that Rocky fired a starter pistol that only shoots blanks, which he carries as a prop for security. The defense contends that the phony gun answers many questions about the case, including why Relli only had grazed knuckles and no other injuries.",
      "The potentially confusing set of \u201cA$AP\u201d names have become familiar to people in the courtroom, and most likely the jury, through the approximately three days of Relli's testimony, which makes up the bulk of prosecutors' case, rested on Thursday.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and if convicted on both, he can legally get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of their toddler sons, slipped into the courtroom Thursday afternoon and sat in Rocky\u2019s section after several days of absence. She had her hair up and wore glasses with a tan trenchcoat on a rainy day in LA.",
      "The defense has not said whether Rocky will take the considerable risk of going on the stand himself, which he is not legally required to do. He already opted to take a significant risk by turning down the prosecution's pre-trial offer of a recommended sentence of just 180 days in jail and other relatively minor penalties in exchange for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Raised in Harlem, the Grammy nominee had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013.",
      "But his role as a fashion maven has almost eclipsed his music. He is set to be a celebrity co-host on fashion's biggest night, the Met Gala, in May.",
      "The suits he wears in the courtroom and the overcoats he wears outside it have become fodder for discussion and inspired a New York Times story on his style.",
      "A publicist for Yves Saint Laurent sent a news release, of the kind usually reserved for red carpets, saying that one day in court he was wearing an \u201cYves jacket in wool chine,\u201d a \u201cshirt in silk crepe de chine\u201d and \u201chigh-waisted pants in wool chine.\u201d",
      "His fashion sense even came up in phone recordings played in court, in which a person purported to be Relli declares that Rocky was \u201cnot a true gangster\u201d and that \u201cthis is the case of Dior.\u201d",
      "The defense has already brought one witness it was allowed to call early, an internet branding consultant who worked with both Rocky and Relli. He recorded phone calls, purportedly with Relli saying his main intention was to get millions from Rocky, and the criminal case didn't matter.",
      "Relli said in his testimony that the recordings were fake.",
      "But prosecutor John Lewin established that everything Relli said in them was consistent with his testimony.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Westminster Kennel Club dog show is back for a 149th year \u2014 and back at New York's Madison Square Garden for the first time since early 2020.",
      "It's a happy homecoming for the United States' most prestigious canine event, which moved to venues outside Manhattan in recent years because of the coronavirus pandemic and then other considerations. But organizers longed to return to the self-described World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.",
      "\u201cIf you love dogs and you want to see the very best dogs from all around the world competing for the top prize of best in show at Westminster, just be there,\u201d club President Donald Sturz said. For fans who can't be there in person, Fox Sports is showing the event's various components on FS1 and FS2 and streaming some on the network's website and app; Westminster is streaming some others. The competition spans Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, with best in show awarded around 11 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast.",
      "Might Mercedes, the German shepherd who was Westminster\u2019s runner-up last year, become top dog this time? Or could this be the year for Monty the giant schnauzer, who was a Westminster finalist the last two years, won the American Kennel Club\u2019s big show in December and is currently the sport's top-ranked dog? Will the prize go to another high-ranking dog \u2014 or a dark horse?",
      "Here are the basics on Westminster and the dog show world it epitomizes.",
      "It begins Saturday morning at the Javits Center convention hall with agility and obedience championships and some demonstration events, including Westminster's first experiment with flyball. That's essentially a canine relay race that involves running a course of jumps and retrieving a ball.",
      "The traditional, breed-by-breed judging \u2014 what show folk call \u201cconformation\u201d \u2014 unfolds Monday and Tuesday. First-round competition, where dogs are judged against others of their breed, happens during the daytime at the Javits Center. Then, in what are essentially semifinals, each breed winner is judged against others within its \u201cgroup\u201d of dozens of breeds at Madison Square Garden in the evenings. In the final round, the seven group winners compete for best in show Tuesday night.",
      "At each level, judges decide which dog in the ring best matches the ideal, or \u201cstandard,\u201d for its own breed.",
      "About 2,500 dogs from 201 breeds and varieties (subsets of breeds) are signed up to compete.",
      "Hailing from every U.S. state and 12 other countries, contestants include such familiar breeds as golden retrievers and such rarities as sloughis. No doodles, though. At least for now, those poodle mixes aren't recognized as purebreds by the American Kennel Club, the governing body for Westminster and many other U.S. dog shows.",
      "Dachshunds are the best-represented breed, with 52 entered.",
      "The agility and obedience contests involve a few hundred more dogs, including mixed-breed ones. Last year a border collie-papillion combination named Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial\u2019s decade-long history.",
      "First, breeders determine which puppies are physically and temperamentally suited for showing. Those pups are raised, trained and groomed to put their best paw forward in the show ring. \u201cBeginner puppies\u201d can start competing in AKC shows at 4 months.",
      "Some owners exhibit their own dogs where and when they can. Others have professional handlers who crisscross the country to compete most weekends, sometimes with multiple pooches.",
      "Trying for a national ranking is known as \u201ccampaigning\u201d a dog, and no wonder. As in politics, hopefuls \u2014 or, here, their owners and handlers \u2014 may gather intel about rivals\u2019 plans and either seek or avoid a face-off. They may weigh a particular judge's record. Some even run full-page ads in dog magazines to congratulate, salute and promote their animals.",
      "All Westminster dogs are champions, as measured by their sport's complicated point system. But yes, there are stats, kept by the Canine Chronicle magazine.",
      "Besides Monty and Mercedes, entrants include Vito, a pug who won the National Dog Show televised Thanksgiving Day, along with 2024 Westminster semifinalists Comet the shih tzu and Louis the Afghan hound. There's a high-ranking otterhound, representing one of the country's rarer breeds, and a big-winning wire fox terrier, whose breed won more than any other at Westminster.",
      "Still, show cognoscenti often say victory goes to \u201cthe dog on the day,\u201d meaning the one that has the performance of a lifetime.",
      "And regardless which dog the judge chooses, others sometimes win the audience's heart. Among the crowd faves over the years: a Sussex spaniel who sat up straight on his hind legs before the judge; a treat-seeking Leonberger who gnawed at his handler\u2019s pocket while going around the ring; and a shiba inu shown by a 10-year-old girl.",
      "Wire fox terriers have taken the top prize 15 times, most recently in 2019. Poodles of various sizes have 11 wins. A miniature poodle named Sage won last year.",
      "Many breeds haven't won yet, including such favorites as the French bulldog and Labrador retriever. But never say never: Two of the last three winners have been firsts for their breeds: the petit basset griffon Vend\u00e9en and the bloodhound.",
      "Bragging rights, ribbons and trophies. There are no cash prizes, though the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 Westminster donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "Animal rights activists routinely protest outside, and sometimes inside, the show. During last year's final round, someone carrying a sign reading \u201cboycott breeders\u201d tried to climb into the ring. The demonstrator was quickly intercepted and arrested.",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

A 911 call from a friend of someone in the house reported armed intruders inside, police said.",

His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters. According to Simon & Schuster, \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will span much of the 20th century as it follows the life of Esther Nacht, a Viennese Jew born in 1905, abandoned at age 4 and taken in as a teen by a New England family.",

      "A Texas crisis communications specialist has sued Blake Lively for defamation after the actor pulled him into her legal fight with co-star and director Justin Baldoni over their film, \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations, filed the $7 million lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday. It says he had nothing to do with any campaign to harm Lively's reputation as she alleged in a court filing.",
      "Wallace is not among the defendants in Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company and publicists, in which she alleges sexual and other harassment during the production and a campaign to smear her after it. The crisis specialist is named in the court papers and the New York Times story published on the day the series of legal battles began in December when Lively filed a complaint.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that Wallace\u2019s lawsuit \u201cis not just a publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\u201d",
      "In a filing last week in Hays County, Texas, that seeks a deposition from Wallace, Lively alleges he was used by publicists working with Baldoni to weaponize \u201ca digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums.\u201d",
      "Wallace's lawsuit says neither he nor his company \"had anything to do with the alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to investigate or aiding and abetting the alleged harassment or alleged retaliation.\u201d",
      "It says the actor's Texas filing \u201cconceded that Lively has no facts supporting the allegations she made against Wallace and Street,\" which is why she now seeks to investigate the extent of his conduct.",

      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\" which opens in theaters Friday",
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "Producers have opted to self-distribute this powerful, pointed look at Israel's policies in seized land despite the movie earning an Oscar nomination and wins at the Berlin International Film Festival, Gotham Awards and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. \u201cNo Other Land\u201d is, in its nature, a piece of advocacy. There are no both-sidesing explored here. The filmmakers \u2014 a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four directors \u2014 make it clear they hope documenting their plight will get the United States to pressure Israel to stop the destruction.",
      "The documentary is largely told from the perspective of Basel Adra, an activist born in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the southern mountains of the occupied West Bank. The Israelis have ordered Palestinians off the land to make room for a military training ground.",
      "Shot between 2019 and 2023 \u2014 filming ended before the Israel-Hamas war exploded \u2014 the bulldozers arrive and never stop, protected by soldiers and ripping through simple concrete homes. The residents retreat to caves, albeit with high-def TV connections. Then they try to rebuild, often under the stealth of night. Then the bulldozers return.",
      "\u201cThey destroy us slowly. Every week, a home,\u201d goes the narration. \u201cEvery week a new family must decide: Endure, or leave their land.\u201d",

Abraham is asked point blank on his arrival: \u201cWhat do you think about what your country is doing to us?\u201d His answer: \u201cI think it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "It is a wrenching movie to see: Soldiers, with vague permission from a court that Palestinians have no say in, push old women and children, not answering their pleas to stop and merely waving away residents whose families have lived in the region since the 1830s. The residents can't vote and their license plates set them apart from Israelis. They're hoping enough likes on social media can change their plight.",
      "We see women carrying out their rugs from rubble and children bewildered as their outhouse is knocked down.",
      "\u201cWe have no other land,\u201d says one resident, giving the documentary its name. At one point, a playground is demolished. At another, a school. Then a well is filled with concrete and water lines are cut with a chainsaw. Sometimes, nearby Israeli settlers attack as soldiers stand by.",
      "The Palestinians are unarmed, except for cellphone cameras, which the soldiers clearly hate. When they march \u2014 a ragtag group with a banner reading \u201cPalestinian Lives Matter\u201d \u2014 they are met with stun grenades.",
      "Shaky cellphone footage of military altercations mix with archive footage, TV newscasts and dreamy, languid shots of dusty villages at night lit by naked bulbs. Sometimes current day images melt to those of a generation ago, when in home movies we see Adra's father protesting the same injustices, a never-ending cycle. His first memory is his father\u2019s first arrest.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d is a piece of resistance but also humanization. When Adra is about to be arrested, his mother says what mothers regularly do: \u201cGo wear a warmer coat,\u201d she counsels. Palestinian children laugh as they play games in the street, throw snowballs in winter and sway gleefully from makeshift swings.",
      "\u201cI hope we\u2019ll change this bad reality,\u201d says Adra at the end. \u201cI hope,\u201d chimes in Abraham.",

      "He sang 88 roles at the Met, and his performance total ranks ninth in the company\u2019s history. While many were as a comprimario, a supporting part surrounding the stars, he sang all three bass roles in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov,\u201d Philip II in Verdi\u2019s \u201cDon Carlo\u201d and for his 25th anniversary with the company the title role in Verdi\u2019s \u201d\u2018Falstaff.\u201d",

      "After singing with the Met\u2019s national touring company, he debuted in that 1967 performance. In 1971, he was the Sacristan in Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca\u201d on the night conductor James Levine made his Met debut.",
      "Plishka said that during rehearsals for those 1971 performances, baritone Peter Glossop pointed to the inexperienced singer and said sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s a Sacristan?\u201d By 2012, Plishka said a colleague praised him in rehearsal for making the small role memorable, saying \u201cNow that\u2019s a Sacristan!\u201d",
      "\u201cIt only took 40 years to grow into the part,\u201d Plishka said with a laugh.",
      "He sang with other companies, most notably Milan's Teatro alla Scala, London's Royal Opera and the New York City Opera, and sang the Grand Inquisitor in \u201cDon Carlo\u201d at the 1988 Salzburg Festival. But the vast majority of his career was at the Met. He announced his retirement in 2012, but the Met persuaded him to return for 30 additional performances as the landlord Benoit and Musetta's admirer Alcindoro in \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d from 2016 to 2018.",

      "After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward",
      "After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th Academy Awards are going forward.",
      "Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community recover.",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this year\u2019s show:",
      "The Academy Awards will be held on Sunday, March 2 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.",
      "For the first time, the Oscars will be streamed live on Hulu. You can also watch via Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, AT&T TV and FuboTV. With authentication from your provider, you can watch on ABC.com and the ABC app.",
      "For the first time, Conan O'Brien is hosting the Academy Awards. O'Brien, the late night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star, said upon the announcement: \u201cAmerica demanded it and now it\u2019s happening: Taco Bell\u2019s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I\u2019m hosting the Oscars.\"",
      "The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show must go ahead, for their economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience.",
      "Organizers have vowed this year\u2019s awards will \u201ccelebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.\u201d",
      "Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of Hollywood's awards season. The film academy canceled its annual nominees luncheon.",
      "For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely. O'Brien's Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable to go back to it. O'Brien's assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian lost her home.",
      "\u201cI know so many people who lost their homes and I\u2019m just, was ridiculously lucky,\u201d O'Brien told The Associated Press. \"So we want to make sure that that show reflects what\u2019s happening and that we put a light on the right people in the right way.\u201d",
      "The academy announced Wednesday that last year's acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph Joy \u2014 will all return to the Oscar stage. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\" style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers has reportedly abandoned those plans for this year's ceremony.",
      "The academy has announced that unlike previous years, the original song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn't mean there won't be music, though. \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the biggest box-office hits of 2024, could feasibly figure into the Oscar plans. (Its songs weren't eligible for best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren't original to the movie.)",
      "The 10 nominees for best picture are: \u201cAnora\u201d; \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d; \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d; \u201cConclave\u201d; \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d; \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d; \u201cNickel Boys\u201d; \u201cThe Substance\u201d; \u201cWicked\u201d",
      "Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year\u2019s Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms. The AP has this handy guide to help with Oscar cramming.",
      "More than most years, that's a tricky question. The best picture race is seen as unusually wide open, with \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cThe Brutalist,\" \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" \u201cAnora\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d all with legitimate hopes of winning. In the acting categories, Demi Moore (\"The Substance\") is favored for best actress, Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\") is most likely in best actor, Zoe Salda\u00f1a (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) is the supporting actress frontrunner and Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\") is the favorite for best supporting actor. None of those awards, however, are considered definite locks.",
      "Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" a narco-musical about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13 nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix's best chance yet to land the streamer its first best picture nomination. Its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar.",
      "But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gasc\u00f3n were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Ozzy Osbourne will reunite with all of the original members of Black Sabbath for the first time in 20 years, in a gig that will be his last and that's being billed as the \u201cgreatest\u201d heavy metal show ever, promoters said Wednesday.",
      "The band, one of the most influential of all heavy metal bands, will headline \u201cThe Back to the Beginning\u201d show on July 5 at Villa Park, home of the Aston Villa Football Club in Birmingham, England.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my time to go back to the beginning \u2026 time for me to give back to the place where I was born,\u201d Osbourne said in a statement. \u201cHow blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham forever.\u201d",
      "Osbourne, who was the band's front man during its peak period in the 1970s and who was widely known as the \"Prince of Darkness,\" will deliver his own short set before Sabbath bandmates, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward, join him for the first time in two decades.",
      "The all-day event will also feature a host of major metal bands including Metallica, Slayer and Alice In Chains, with more names to be announced shortly.",
      "\u201cThis will be the greatest heavy metal show ever,\" music director Tom Morello said.",
      "In 2020, Osbourne revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and he paused touring in 2023 after extensive spinal surgery. He has struggled with health issues since 2003 following a near-fatal quad bike crash, injuries that were aggravated in 2019 when he fell at home.",
      "Sabbath\u2019s story began in Birmingham in 1968 when the four original members were looking to escape a life of factory work. Their eponymous debut album in 1970 made the U.K. top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit albums, including 1971's \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d and \u201cVol. 4\u201d a year later. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide.",
      "Osbourne's fame expanded into the mainstream in the early 2000s, when he joined his wife Sharon Osbourne, and two of their children in the hugely successful MTV reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "All profits from the July 5 show will go to charities including Cure Parkinson\u2019s, Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital and Acorn Children\u2019s Hospice, which is supported by Aston Villa.",

      "NEW YORK -- If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you'll likely see a key person's influence \u2014 even if you don't actually see her.",
      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",
      "Schade, whose first book was \u201c Bonding With Your Dog \u201d and who then pivoted to writing pet-oriented novels, like \u201cLife on the Leash\u201d and \u201cDog Friendly,\u201d is a wealth of information about our four-legged friends.",
      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\" starring Amy Schumer as a woman who fakes a baby bump, is a kinda throwback comedy",
      "We have by now become accustomed to the lengths some movie characters will go to keep a good comedy lie going. But it\u2019s still a special kind of feat when Amy Schumer, playing a baby-mad single woman who fakes a baby bump in \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d is so desperate to maintain the fiction that she shoves a roast turkey up her dress.",
      "You might be thinking: This is too ridiculous. The stuffing, alone. But if we bought \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d I see no reason to quibble with the set-up of \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a funny and often perceptive satire on motherhood, both real and pretend.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, is a kinda throwback comedy. Like \u201c40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d you can basically get the movie just from its title.",
      "But like any good high-concept comedy, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is predominantly a far-fetched way for its star and co-writer, Schumer, to riff frankly on her chosen topic. Here, that\u2019s the wide gamut of pregnancy experience \u2014 the body changes, the gender reveal parties, the personal jealousies \u2014 all while mixing in a healthy amount of pseudo-pregnant pratfalls.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since Schumer was essentially launched as a movie star in the 2015 Judd Apatow-directed \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d But \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which Schumer wrote with Julie Paiva, almost as adeptly channels Schumer\u2019s comic voice \u2014 the one that made the sketch series \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d so great.",
      "The movie\u2019s opening flashes back to Lainey (Schumer) as a child playing with dolls and imagining herself a mother-to-be. So committed is she to the role that Lainey, in mock-labor, screams at her friend and then politely apologies: \u201cSorry, but the expectant mother often lashes out at her support system.\u201d",
      "But as middle age approaches, Lainey, a high school teacher in Brooklyn, isn\u2019t close to her dream. At the dinner where she suspects \u2014 no, is so certain that she tears open the desert looking for a ring \u2014 that her longtime boyfriend (Damon Wayans Jr.) is going to pop the question, he instead asks her to join a threesome. Back at school, Lainey\u2019s school lesson on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d turns darkly cynical.",
      "Things are even worse when Lainey\u2019s married best friend (Jillian Bell) divulges that she\u2019s pregnant. \u201cGet rid of it!\u201d blurts Lainey before apologizing. When the pair later go clothes shopping, Lainey absentmindedly tries on belly padding. The saleswoman is instantly nice to her, offering a burrito and a foot rub. \u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d she asks. \u201cDoor dash,\u201d responds Lainey before adding, \u201cdriver.\u201d",
      "Much of the fun in \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is watching Lainey come up with increasingly ridiculous lies as she tries to pull off the pregnant act. (After accidentally picking Thanksgiving as her time of inception, Lainey digs a deeper hole by suggesting it happened at \u201ca Black Friday Eve sale.\u201d)",
      "But the ruse becomes more difficult when she, during a pregnant workout class, meets a woman (Brianne Howey, refreshingly authentic) she genuinely likes and wants to be friends with. Even more complicated: Lainey starts falling for another guy she first meets at a coffee shop ( Will Forte ).",
      "In a movie filled with funny people (others include Urzila Carlson as a guidance counselor, and Alex Moffat as a idiotic father-to-be) Forte is an especially good presence in \u201cKinda Pregnant.\u201d For a performer of such madcap absurdity, Forte fits in remarkably naturally in a more rom-com setting. He\u2019s also got a wonderfully ridiculous occupation, even by rom-com standards, driving a Zamboni in Central Park.",
      "You can probably guess how \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d goes from here. Director Tyler Spindel, nephew to Adam Sandler (a producer on the film), doesn't do anything to advance the movie comedy, a languishing proposition in recent years with few big-screen exceptions. But he crucially gives his performers plenty of space to be themselves, and Lainey's desperate desire to have a family comes across as both over-the-top and genuine. If \u201cKnocked Up\u201d captured the comedy of getting unexpectedly pregnant, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d embodies the pain of wishing you were.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content, language throughout and drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- It was hushed inside a 140-year-old cathedral on the outskirts of Little Rock's downtown as about five dozen people sat in the pews during a recent lunch break in January.",
      "The nave filled with the sounds of the Gothic church's pipe organ, and a screen showed a man performing the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Those gathered weren't there for church, but for the third concert in a series Colin MacKnight is performing over the next year to commemorate the 275th anniversary of Bach's death.",
      "MacKnight, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral's music director, is performing all of Bach's organ works throughout 2025 \u2014 one lunch break at a time. The ambitious plan entails performing 18 hours of music in half-hour increments nearly every Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've wanted to for a really long time because it's, I think, the most thorough way of immersing myself in the brilliance of Johann Sebastian Bach,\u201d MacKnight said one morning as he rehearsed in the empty cathedral the day before a concert.",
      "The concerts in Little Rock are among several events around the world this year commemorating the German composer\u2019s legacy and the anniversary of his death.",
      "MacKnight, who is from Bethesda, Maryland, has been music director at Trinity for three years. He said the first time he remembers hearing Bach was at a relative's funeral when he was about 12 years old.",
      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",

      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in herds since last year",
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.",
      "The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts said it raises new questions about wider spread and the difficulty of controlling infections in animals and the people who work closely with them.",
      "\u201cI always thought one bird-to-cow transmission was a very rare event. Seems that may not be the case,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said. It has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. The new version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on Friday, according to USDA. It was detected in milk collected as part of a surveillance program launched in December.",
      "\u201cNow we know why it's really important to test and continue testing,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who helped identify the first spillover.",
      "The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada. A person in Louisiana died in January after developing severe respiratory symptoms following contact with wild and backyard birds. In British Columbia, a teen girl was hospitalized for months with a virus traced to poultry.",
      "At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "USDA officials said they would post genetic sequences and other information about the new form of the virus to a public repository later this week. Scientists said that would be key to understanding whether the spillover was a recent event or whether the virus has been circulating, perhaps widely, for longer.",
      "\u201cIf this turns out to have been something that crossed into cattle a couple months ago, a couple months is a long time not to detect it,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has studied the H5N1 virus in cattle.",
      "He added that it's important for federal officials to share promptly information about a virus that has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could \u201cmake COVID seem like a walk in the park.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a vital part of national security, global security, the well-being of people, of animals and of businesses in the U.S.,\u201d Worobey added.",

      "A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits company alleging their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 jump in the cost of his asthma medication",
      "LA CROSSE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits management company, alleging that their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 spike in his asthma medication.",
      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",
      "Walgreens officials didn't immediately respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment on the lawsuit."

      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",

      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",
      "In total, 669 women died in 2023 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, the CDC reported. That\u2019s down from 817 deaths in 2022 and 1,205 in 2021, when it was the highest in more than 50 years.",
      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",
      "CDC officials refused an Associated Press request to talk to a report author.",
      "The government is still receiving and processing death reports from last year. But Declercq said his analysis of available data suggests the number of 2024 maternal deaths may end up about the same as 2023.",

      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital.

      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",

      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",

      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",

      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",
      "WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said at the meeting on the impact of the U.S. withdrawal last week that losing the U.S. was \u201cterrible,\u201d but member states had \u201ctremendous capacity to fill in those gaps.\u201d",
      "Ryan told WHO member countries: \u201cThe U.S. is leaving a community of nations. It\u2019s essentially breaking up with you.\u201d",
      "Kavanagh doubted the U.S. would be able to match WHO's ability to gather details about emerging health threats globally, and said its exit from the agency \u201cwill absolutely lead to worse health outcomes for Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow much worse remains to be seen,\u201d Kavanagh said.",

      "David Stein called Reptile Relocation Sydney last week after watching around six snakes slither into the mulch. He learned from an internet search that pregnant, known as gravid, red-belly blacks pile on top of each other before they give birth.",
      "Snake catcher Dylan Cooper arrived that afternoon. Stein helped rake away mulch as Cooper bagged 102 pregnant and newborn snakes.",
      "\u201cJust seeing that amount in one group, it gives you a bit of the shudders,\u201d Stein said Friday.",
      "Reptile Relocation Sydney owner Cory Kerewaro said two of the captured adults gave birth to a total of 29 snakes in the bag while Cooper was still sifting through mulch catching more.",
      "The final tally was five adults and 97 offspring caught, Kerewaro said.",
      "Experts don't know why so many snakes gave birth in such a short time frame at Stein\u2019s 1.4-hectare (3.5-acre) property in suburban Horsley Park on Sydney\u2019s western outskirts.",
      "Kerewaro said the largest haul he\u2019d heard of in a similar snake removal job was 30 non-venomous carpet pythons. Pythons hatch from eggs while red-belly blacks give birth.",
      "\u201cYou can get a decent number like that when the babies are hatching,\u201d Kerewaro said. \u201cBut to have this many venomous snakes, no one\u2019s come across it.\"",

      "But as she slumped in a folding chair outside the gates of the British prime minister\u2019s office on day 129 of a hunger strike, she was just a mother \u2014 a mom trying to win freedom for her son who has spent more than five years in an Egyptian prison, accused of \u201cspreading false news\u201d on social media.",
      "Sacrificing her very self is the only way Soueif sees to focus attention on what she says is unjust imprisonment of her son, Alaa Abd el-Fattah.",
      "\u201cThe great majority of mothers are prepared to die for their children; it just takes different forms,\u2019\u2019 she said on Wednesday. \u201cMost mothers, if their children are in actual danger, you\u2019re prepared to die.\u2019\u2019",
      "One of Egypt\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy activists, Abd el-Fattah has spent most of the past 14 years behind bars since taking part in the 2011 uprising that toppled autocratic former President Hosni Mubarak.",
      "His most recent crime was \u201cliking\u201d a Facebook post describing torture in Egyptian prisons. Abd el-Fattah has been in custody since September 2019, and was sentenced to five years in prison after a trial before an emergency security court.",
      "But when his release date came up last September, Egyptian authorities refused to count the more than two years he had spent in pre-trial detention and ordered him held until Jan. 3, 2027.",
      "Because Abd el-Fattah, 43, has both British and Egyptian citizenship, Soueif is calling on the U.K. government to put pressure on their counterparts in Cairo to release him.",
      "This may be a good moment for Britain to speak up because Egypt will be looking for European support in opposing President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to take control of the Gaza Strip and relocate its Palestinian residents to neighboring Arab countries, Soueif said.",
      "\u201cNow that Donald Trump has upset the whole world, they actually need allies\u2026\u201d she said. \u201cSo, in fact, I think it\u2019s time for the Egyptian government to look to its European allies and to its allies among the Egyptian people. Freeing other political prisoners in Egypt would be a good thing to do right now.\u201d",
      "Thousands of critics of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi have been locked up under dire conditions after unjust trials, human rights groups say.",
      "Soueif\u2019s son also went on hunger strike during Egypt\u2019s hosting of the international climate conference COP27. His strike, which ended when he lost consciousness and was revived with fluids, drew attention to Egypt\u2019s heavy suppression of speech and political activity, but failed to secure his freedom.",
      "Since 2013, el-Sissi\u2019s government has cracked down on dissidents and critics, jailing thousands, virtually banning protests and monitoring social media.",
      "Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that as many as 60,000 political prisoners are incarcerated in Egyptian prisons, but there have been no similar tallies in recent years. In 2019, el-Sissi told the U.S. news program \u201960 Minutes\u2019 that the country did \u201cnot have political prisoners or prisoners of opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing under (el-Sissi\u2019s) government is that this kind of repression is endless,\u2019\u2019 said Amr Magdi, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s relentless.\u2019\u2019",
      "A spokesman for Egypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Abd el-Fattah\u2019s continued detention or the nature of communications between Egypt and the United Kingdom on his case. A government media office also declined to respond, saying it was a matter for Egypt\u2019s embassy in the U.K. The embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "As in Abd el-Fattah\u2019s case, new charges are often rotated to replace the original offenses, allowing authorities to circumvent laws that prohibit pre-trial detention of more than two years, rights groups say.",
      "During the United Nations Human Rights Council\u2019s review of Egypt last month, the Egyptian government insisted that Abd el-Fattah's trial was \u201cfair,\u201d and that his five-year prison term was set to end in 2027.",
      "But the U.K.\u2019s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said the government continues to press for Abd el-Fattah\u2019s release, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer writing to el-Sissi on multiple occasions and Foreign Secretary David Lammy raising the issue with his counterpart as recently as on Jan. 23.",
      "\u201cOur priority remains securing the release of Mr (Abd el-Fattah) so that he can be reunited with his family,\u201d the Foreign Office said in a statement.",
      "Soueif acknowledged the British government's efforts, but appealed for more help in securing her son's release.",
      "\u201cNobody should be imprisoned for speech or writing \u2014 nobody,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople, particularly people in countries that pretend to be democracies and that abide by the rule of law, should not allow this kind of thing.\u201d",
      "So the 68-year-old mom continues her crusade.",
      "Soueif has been on hunger strike since Sep. 29, the day her son was supposed to be released, consuming nothing but herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts.",
      "She took her campaign directly to the Foreign Office in December, camping out in front of it every weekday to make sure officials notice her. When that yielded no results, she switched in mid-January to the gates of Starmer\u2019s office \u2014 the famous black door of 10 Downing Street.",
      "After more than four months, Soueif has lost 25 kilos (55 pounds) and jokes that she was helped by being a little overweight at the start of her hunger strike. Her soft voice is sometimes difficult to hear over the street noise and she has trouble getting out of her chair. She's also been to the emergency room this week.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m slower. I\u2019m more weepy,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI never used to be weepy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s already a miracle I have hung on this long,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat to say? We are in completely uncharted waters. ... It\u2019s a risk I have to take.\u201d",
      "So, every weekday morning she unfolds her chair and adds another hash mark to the sidewalk tally charting her hunger strike.",
      "Framed by \u201cFree Alaa\u201d posters and a banner that reads \u201cKeir Starmer, bring my son home,\u201d there are also pictures of mother and son together in happier times \u2014 a hug by a waterfall, a celebration after an earlier release from prison, and three blowups of her curly-haired boy smiling for the camera.",
      "On one morning this week, when another protester asked why no one is interested in his immigration issue, Soueif quiets him with a few words.",
      "\u201cMy son, my son,\u2019\u2019 she says pleading. \u201cHe\u2019s a political prisoner in Egypt.\u2019\u2019",
      "A group of French schoolchildren walk by, pausing to look at her signs and count the chalk marks on the pavement. Soueif talks to them in French: \u201cMy son. I\u2019m here because of my son.\u2019\u2019",
      "Anyone who will listen is Soueif's audience. You never know. Perhaps someone can do something.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going on until either Alaa is released or I collapse,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how long that will be.\u201d"

      "The Associated Press has obtained audio of what military officials say is a broadcast from a Russian spy ship that suffered a fire and drifted uncontrolled off Syria's coast last month",
      "PARIS -- The man is insistent: Our ship is in difficulty, so keep your distance, he instructs another vessel over the radio.",
      "\u201cWarship on your course,\u201d he says. \"I am drifting. I\u2019m not under command.\u201d",
      "The broadcast, according to military officials, came from a Russian spy ship, the Kildin, as the vessel packed with intelligence-gathering equipment drifted temporarily out of control off the Syrian coast on Jan. 23, with flames and black fumes rising from its smokestack.",
      "The Associated Press obtained audio of the broadcast, as well as video and photos showing the blaze, that three military officials said were gathered by a ship from a NATO nation operating nearby. The officials, also from a NATO country, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven't publicly reported.",
      "The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia's fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely because of concerns that Moscow might sabotage underwater cables and pipelines amid tensions over the war in Ukraine. Even though the Kildin was in trouble, the secretive ship didn\u2019t respond to an offer of help from the NATO vessel, the officials said.",
      "The U.K. last month tracked another Russian vessel that it identified as a spy ship in the English Channel. The Defense Ministry said the Yantar \u201cwas caught loitering over critical undersea infrastructure\" and that a Royal Navy submarine surfaced close to the ship \u201cto warn it had been secretly monitoring its every move.\u201d",
      "The 55-year-old Kildin gathers intelligence on NATO activities in the Mediterranean and had been operating near naval exercises by alliance member Turkey before the fire, according to the officials who spoke to the AP.",
      "They said the blaze burned for at least four hours and that the Kildin\u2019s crew removed the covers from lifeboats though they never put them to sea.",
      "The Kildin also hoisted two black balls from its masts \u2014 a maritime signal that the ship can no longer steer, the officials said.",
      "They said the crew eventually regained control and that the Kildin is still stationed and gathering intelligence off the Syrian port of Tartus, accompanied by a frigate and a supply vessel. It is not clear what caused the blaze.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he wasn\u2019t aware of a fire aboard the Kildin and didn\u2019t say what the ship was doing at the time.",
      "He dismissed suggestions that it reflected poorly on Russian naval readiness. \u201cAssessing the state of the fleet based on the breakdown of one particular ship or one particular malfunction is not professional,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "Retired Vice Adm. Michel Olhagaray, a former head of France\u2019s center for higher military studies, said that even though the Kildin regained steering, the fire highlights the logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean, far from its bases in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea.",
      "Moscow also is no longer able to use its Black Sea Fleet for Mediterranean patrols because during the Ukraine war Turkey isn\u2019t allowing warships to pass through the Bosporus, which links the Black and Mediterranean seas.",
      "\u201cThe maintenance of this Russian fleet, particularly in the Mediterranean, is extraordinarily complex,\u201d Olhagaray said.",
      "The audio gathered by the NATO ship is a 75-second radio exchange between the Kildin and a Togo-flagged cargo ship, Milla Moon, the officials said.",
      "The AP also obtained a second recording of conversations among crew members aboard the NATO ship. In that, they can be heard identifying the exchange they\u2019ve just monitored as being between the Kildin and a Togolese vessel. Military officials provided both recordings to the AP, which was not able to independently authenticate them.",
      "Ship-tracking websites that use the data vessels emit on their identity, position, speed and course show the Milla Moon lifted anchor off Tartus and started cruising northward along Syria's coast on Jan. 23. That was the day of the Kildin fire, also in waters off Tartus, the military officials said.",
      "They said the Kildin at first identified itself to the Milla Moon as another ship, the Sky, and then asked to switch channels to continue the conversation.",
      "After the switch, the man with accented English is then heard identifying his vessel as a warship.",
      "\u201cMotor vessel Milla Moon, this is warship on your course,\u201d the voice can be heard saying on the clip. \u201cPlease hear me.\u201d",
      "He asks the Milla Moon to steer clear.",
      "\u201cI am drifting. I\u2019m not under command,\" he says.",

      "Meanwhile, under the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for Israel\u2019s troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon, initially set for Jan. 26, was extended to Feb. 18, while Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River \u2014 which serves as the boundary for a zone free of non-state armed groups.",
      "Lebanese army troops and U.N. peacekeepers are to deploy in the area, but Israel has accused Lebanon of slow deployment, while Lebanon claims Israel\u2019s delayed pullout has hindered its progress.",
      "The ceasefire is overseen by a U.S.-led International Monitoring and Implementation Mechanism, comprising representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Still, Lebanon has accused Israel of committing hundreds of ceasefire violations.",
      "During Aoun and Ortagus\u2019s meeting, an Israeli airstrike targeted Sidon province, well north of the Litani River. It was not immediately clear what was hit, and the Israeli army did not immediately comment.",

      "Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the territory",
      "CAIRO -- Israel said on Thursday it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump's plan for the territory. Officials meanwhile said Egypt has launched an diplomatic blitz behind the scenes to try and head off the plan.",
      "The Trump administration has already dialed back aspects of the proposal after it was widely rejected internationally, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. U.S. officials have provided few details about how or when the plan would be carried out.",
      "In a social media post on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn Gaza over to the United States after the war and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed for his plan to redevelop it.",
      "The Palestinians have vehemently rejected Trump's proposal, fearing that Israel would never allow refugees to return. Egypt has warned that an expulsion of Palestinians would destabilize the region and undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence for decades.",
      "Saudi Arabia, another key U.S. ally, has also rejected any mass transfer of Palestinians and says it will not normalize relations with Israel \u2014 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2014 without the creation of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have depicted the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say the plan, if implemented, would amount to \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d the forcible relocation of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he has ordered the military to make preparations to facilitate the emigration of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza through land crossings as well as \u201cspecial arrangements for exit by sea and air.\u201d",
      "There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground.",
      "Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump's stunning proposal that most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. Israel's 15-month campaign against the militant Hamas group had reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble before a fragile ceasefire took hold last month.",
      "But Egyptian officials, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel \u2014 which has stood for nearly half a century \u2014 is at risk.",
      "One official said the message has been delivered to the Pentagon, the State Department and members of the U.S. Congress. A second official said it has also been conveyed to Israel and its Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany.",
      "A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving the message from Egypt through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt was very serious and viewed the plan as a threat to its national security.",
      "The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump said he wanted to \u201cpermanently\u201d resettle most of Gaza's population in other countries and for the United States to take charge of clearing debris and rebuilding Gaza as a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\" for all people. He did not rule out the deployment of U.S. troops there.",
      "U.S. officials later appeared to walk it back, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary and that Trump had not committed to putting American boots on the ground or spending American tax dollars in Gaza.",
      "The Egyptian officials said their government does not believe the Palestinians need to be relocated for reconstruction to proceed and is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has said it will maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital.",
      "Last week, Egypt hosted a meeting of top diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 which was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords Trump brokered with Israel. All five Arab nations rejected the transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank.",
      "In an editorial on Thursday, Egypt\u2019s main state-run daily, Al-Ahram, warned that \u201cthe Arab countries' independence, their peoples\u2019 unity and their territorial integrity are under grave threat.\u201d",

      "Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo says his country will accept migrants from other countries who are being deported from the United States",
      "GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo said Wednesday his country will accept migrants from other countries who are being deported from the United States, the second deportation deal that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reached during a Central America trip that has been focused mainly on immigration.",
      "Under the agreement announced by Ar\u00e9valo, the deportees would be returned to their home countries at U.S. expense.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed to increase by 40% the number of flights of deportees both of our nationality as well as deportees from other nationalities,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo said at a news conference with Rubio.",
      "Previously, including under the Biden administration, Guatemala had been accepting on average seven to eight flights of its citizens from the U.S. per week. Under President Donald Trump it's also been one of the countries that have had migrants returned on U.S. military planes.",
      "El Salvador announced a similar but broader agreement on Monday. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said his country would accept U.S. deportees of any nationality, including American citizens and legal residents who are imprisoned for violent crimes.",
      "Both Trump and Rubio acknowledged the legal uncertainty of sending Americans to another country for imprisonment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just saying if we had a legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we do or not, we\u2019re looking at that right now.\u201d",
      "Rubio called it a very generous offer but said there were \u201cobviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution.\u201d",
      "Immigration, a Trump administration priority, has been the major focus of Rubio\u2019s first foreign trip as America\u2019s top diplomat, a five-country tour spanning Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "The agreements with El Salvador and Guatemala potentially help the Trump administration address what has always been a key sticking point in immigration enforcement since not everyone in the U.S. illegally can be easily sent back home.",
      "Venezuela, for example, has been a major source of migrants coming to the U.S. in recent years, but rarely can the U.S. deport Venezuelans back to their home country. But the U.S. already has a robust network set up to send people to several Central American countries.",
      "Guatemala will expand its capacity to receive not just Guatemalans, but also migrants from other countries who will then be repatriated to their home countries. The details still need to be worked out.",
      "\u201cHowever, the permanent answer to immigration is to bring development so that no one has to leave the country,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo said. To that end, a high-level Guatemalan delegation, including from the private sector, will travel to Washington in the coming weeks.",
      "Ar\u00e9valo also announced the formation of a new border security force that will patrol Guatemala\u2019s borders with Honduras and El Salvador. The force will be made up of police and soldiers and will combat transnational crime of all kinds, he said.",
      "Rubio's trip has been dogged by the administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, including a late Tuesday order abruptly pulling almost all agency staffers off the job.",
      "After the news conference with Guatemala's president, Rubio headed directly to the U.S. Embassy, where staffers and their families who were unsure of their futures gathered to hear from their new boss.",
      "The meet-and-greet event was closed to the press, as was an earlier similar event in El Salvador. Both Guatemala and El Salvador have significant USAID missions. In Panama on Sunday before the shut down announcement, Rubio\u2019s embassy event had been open to journalists.",
      "From there Rubio wrapped up his Guatemala stop by visiting a local migration facility near an air force base where deportees are processed for integration back into their home communities. Under the measures announced Wednesday by Guatemala\u2019s president, the number of deportees is expected to rise by as much as 40%. The program has been supported by the U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Rubio also got a briefing on Guatemala\u2019s counternarcotics efforts, including the interception of at least four shipments of fentanyl precursors since late November totaling 127.5 kilograms (280 pounds), enough to produce more than 114 million doses of the drug.",
      "Rubio, who has offered exemptions to Trump\u2019s sweeping freeze on foreign assistance, has signed waivers to allow funding for both programs to continue, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an example of foreign aid that\u2019s in our national interest. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve issued a waiver for these programs. That\u2019s why these programs are coming back online. And they will be functioning because it\u2019s a way of showing to the American people this is the kind of foreign aid that\u2019s aligned with our foreign policy, with our national interest,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio also spoke Wednesday with Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente to discuss ways to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, fight fentanyl and transnational criminal organizations and end illegal immigration, according to a State Department statement.",

      "LONDON -- Scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence and human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago.",
      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",
      "Scholars are being encouraged to join in the effort to complete the text.",
      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cMaybe there will be something which can be moved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then don\u2019t forget that there is like 1000 more scrolls in Naples.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A wave of antisemitic attacks has roiled Australia, with a dozen arrests for vandalizing or setting homes, schools, and synagogues on fire since October and hundreds more charged in just over a year with crimes targeting Jews.",
      "The attacks in areas where Jewish people live have provoked an outpouring of condemnation \u2014 and a fraught and complicated debate about who\u2019s to blame. But in a rare moment of unity, Australia\u2019s federal lawmakers on Thursday advanced hate crime laws almost unanimously.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "\u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d opposition leader Peter Dutton said.",
      "Jewish and Muslim organizations and hate researchers have recorded drastic spikes in hate-fueled incidents on both groups since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza. And although how groups define antisemitism and Islamophobia differs, the numbers the organizations cite all show a rise in incidents.",
      "Antisemitic episodes in the two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 home to 85% of Australia\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 have drawn the highest profile because they\u2019re severe, unusual and public.",
      "Since November they've included:",
      "\u2014 A trailer filled with explosives used in the mining industry and a list of Jewish targets discovered on Sydney's outskirts",
      "\u2014 Firebombing of a Melbourne synagogue, with one person hurt. Defacement of another with Nazi symbols and pro-Palestine graffiti",
      "\u2014 A Jewish childcare center set on fire",

      "\u2014 The former home of a prominent Jewish leader sprayed with graffiti",
      "\u2014 Cars defaced and windows smashed in areas where Jews live",
      "Counter-terrorism officials have arrested 12 people in connection with those crimes. Nearly 200 more have been charged since October 2023 in the state of New South Wales \u2013 where Sydney is located \u2013 with crimes linked to antisemitism, police say.",
      "Investigators are examining whether criminals for hire were paid by foreign actors to carry out the recent attacks, leaders of the taskforce said in January. They did not specify what foreign interests they believed were responsible.",
      "Days later, officials said the 12 arrested by the taskforce don't share the antisemitic ideology expressed by their crimes, underscoring suggestions that the acts were orchestrated abroad.",
      "The revelations were strange \u2014 but not unprecedented, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not completely new, the connection between ideological groups and criminal groups,\u201d said Matteo Vergani, a researcher of hate and extremism with Deakin University. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that it usually happens in relation to larger scale terrorist attacks. So that is surprising.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers in speeches this week said the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas had provoked a outburst of antisemitism at levels Australia had not registered before.",
      "In tense public debates echoing those in the United States and elsewhere, right-leaning lawmakers and some Jewish leaders \u2014 among them Peter Wertheim from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry \u2014 have accused pro-Palestinian demonstrators, particularly \u201cprogressives\u201d and university students, he said, of fueling the crimes.",
      "Demonstrators use opposition to Israel to target Jews and give antisemitism \u201ca new social license,\u201d he said.",
      "Other Jewish leaders were more cautious. The episodes were \u201calarming and worthy of attention,\u201d said Sarah Schwartz from the Jewish Council of Australia.",
      "\u201cBut I think the real danger we see here with linking this spate of antisemitic incidents to the Palestine solidarity movement is that that sort of language breeds division, breeds anti-Palestinian racism, breeds Islamophobia and is also bad for Jews as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Albanese\u2019s center-left government on Thursday approved measures in the House of Representatives that will create new and bolstered hate crime offences protecting a raft of characteristics, including race, religion and gender.",
      "Amendments from the opposition include the imposition of mandatory prison terms for terrorism offenses \u2014 which the prime minister had rejected before \u2014- and for displaying hate symbols.",
      "The bill passed 117 votes to 13. It's expected the Senate will pass it into law.",

      "\u2014 Criminalizing Nazi salutes",
      "\u2014 Making doxing \u2014 the sharing of personal information online \u2014 illegal after a list of Australian Jews was published on the internet in 2024",
      "\u2014 Appointing national envoys to address Islamophobia and antisemitism",
      "Some states have passed their own laws; New South Wales also revealed proposed hate crime measures Thursday.",
      "By all measures, anti-Jewish hate has spiked across the U.S., Europe and the United Kingdom since October 2023 \u2014 even though many leaders have denounced it \u2014 prompting tens of thousands of Jews to leave Europe, according to some figures.",
      "However, Australia\u2019s situation had distinctive factors, analysts said. One was the claim that the primary agitators could be based abroad.",
      "Another was the shock of such hate in a country far from the Middle East where a small community of Jews \u2014 fewer than 120,000 people, or about 0.5% of the population \u2014 has lived relatively peacefully, said Wertheim.",
      "Australia\u2019s restrictive gun laws might have led the perpetrators to commit vandalism crimes, Vergani said. Semiautomatic rifles were outlawed in Australia after a gun massacre in 1996.",
      "But the episodes have also driven a fraught political climate ahead of a national election due by May 17.",
      "Antisemitic attacks have led national news and prompted daily questions for Albanese \u2014 and claims of inaction from his main political opponent, conservative Liberal party leader Dutton. Meanwhile, Dutton\u2019s detractors have lambasted him for politicizing the crimes \u2014 a charge he has rejected \u2014 and for urging a freeze on visas for Palestinians fleeing the war.",
      "Lawmakers this week focused on the wave of antisemitism since Oct. 7 2023 and ignored \u201ca very long history of antisemitism and racism\u201d against other groups in Australia, including Muslims and Indigenous people, said Schwarz.",
      "Still, the crimes have terrified Australian Jews, she added. Vergani said Jewish people tell him they have not experienced such hatred in Australia before.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never in their lives had this continuous feeling that something bigger could happen,\u201d he said.",

      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",

In a lobbying blitz in Washington this week, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a \u201crobust American energy and manufacturing economy\u201d and sported lapel pins that said \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d \u2014 a favorite Trump phrase.",

Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. \u201cIf we play your cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.\u201d",
      "Inglis pointed to Elon Musk's empire-building on electric cars, solar panels and batteries.",
      "\"When right-of-center people hear, \u2019you know, you can you make a profit at this' then it makes sense. Otherwise, it\u2019s like, why are people giving stuff away?\" Inglis said.",
      "Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there's a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word \u2014 and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it \"unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.\u201d",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, \"if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?\u201d",
      "In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings this week, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.",
      "The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.",
      "\u201cIn the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,\u201d Stolark said. \u201cThe messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.",

      "To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.",
      "\u201cThe honesty and coherence of the business and financial sectors in making the economic case for the transition is refreshing, at least, after years of doublespeak, greenwashing and confusion,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect strategy from a climate or social perspective, as the private sector cannot on its own fully decarbonize the economy ...

      "Officials say Indonesian authorities have ordered the halting of development of a tourism project affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump over water management and environment issues",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian authorities have ordered the halting of development of a tourism project affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump over water management and environmental issues, officials said Friday.",
      "The 3,000-hectare (11.6-square-mile) project is the brainchild of Trump\u2019s Indonesian business partner, billionaire and politician Hary Tanoesoedibjo, who attended Trump's inauguration in Washington last month.",
      "His association with Trump began in 2014 when his group company, MNC, was looking for an operator for sprawling \u201csix star\u201d resorts, one to be built on the tourist island of Bali and the other near Jakarta.",
      "In exchange for a cut of the revenue, the Trump Organization would manage hotels, golf courses and country clubs that would cost about $700 million for MNC to build. The projects form the core of larger developments that the company plans.",
      "In a January 2017 interview with The Associated Press, Tanoesoedibjo, better known as Tanoe, said that developing the whole 3,000 hectares of Lido City would take more than a decade and cost up to $3 billion, of which the Trump properties would cost more than $300 million.",
      "The company has been promoting the project for years. In 2023, then Indonesian President Joko Widodo gave it special economic zone status, providing MNC Land with tax breaks and leniency on permits.",
      "A sprawling \u201cTrump Community\u201d has been built since 2014 in this pocket of Indonesia\u2019s most densely populated island, with a new toll road leading to it, located in Gunung Gede Pangrango, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the capital, Jakarta, and is home to a new Trump golf course, which started offering membership last year.",
      "Though a private development, Lido City suits the Indonesian government\u2019s ambitions to create more tourist destinations that it hopes will be as popular as Bali.",
      "It\u2019s part of broader plans, including a huge theme park, that have alarmed conservationists who fear development will overwhelm habitats for some of the archipelago\u2019s most threatened species.",
      "The Environment Ministry said in a statement that mismanagement of rainwater at the resort had caused sedimentation in Lido Lake, making it shallower and halving the size of the body of water to 12 hectares (30 acres).",
      "\u201cThe mismatch between environmental plans and physical implementation is a serious concern in efforts to preserve natural resources,\u201d said Ardyanto Nugroho, the ministry's director of environmental complaints, monitoring and law enforcement.",
      "He said that his team was still waiting for laboratory test results to determine further steps in the environmental law enforcement process.",
      "\u201cWe committed to preserving the environment and will take firm action against violations that impact the ecosystem and surrounding communities,\u201d Nugroho said.",
      "Local media reports showed a board with a sign that the project was under \u201csupervision\u201d installed on one side of Lido Lake.",
      "Gunung Gede Pangrango is one of the last virgin tropical forests in Java, where only 2% of original forest remains. It nurtures a dazzling variety of flora and fauna: more than 2,000 species of ferns, mosses and flowering plants, and 250 species of birds.",
      "Endangered species include the Javan slow loris \u2014 the world\u2019s only venomous primate \u2014 the Javan leaf monkey, the Javan leopard, whose total population numbers less than 250, and the Javan hawk-eagle and Javan silvery gibbon.",
      "The park has a rehabilitation center for silvery gibbons that have been rescued from the illegal wildlife trade. The gibbons, known for practicing lifelong monogamy and their distinctively small, intense faces, number fewer than 4,000 in the wild.",
      "PT MNC Land President Director Budi Rustanto denied that his company's project had caused the sedimentation in Lido Lake, saying it also came from other projects, offices, housing and buildings in the surrounding area, including a government office compound and existing community settlements.",
      "He said that his property firm had followed the criteria and prerequisites related to the environmental impact analysis, known as AMDAL.",
      "\u201cSince 2013, we have always tried to overcome the problem of shallowing of the lake, this is because 50% of the lake area is in our development area,\" Rustanto told Kompas news outlet, adding that a number of efforts will continue to be made to overcome the problem of shallowing of the lake, including dredging plans.",
      "Environmentalists welcomed the government\u2019s move as a sign that it was serious in addressing the failure of project management to consider the environmental impact near the land designated as a Special Economic Zone.",
      "Executive Chair of Konservasi Indonesia, Meizani Irmadhiany, said the Lido area is one of the most important watersheds of the Cimandiri river and part of the landscape of Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, not only for the people of West Java but also for the residents of Jakarta.",
      "\u201cThe slope contours serve as a significant water catchment area, and the area planned for the project is located on critical land,\u201d Irmadhiany said. \u201cIt is time for the business sector to prioritize environmental principles which have direct impacts on the environment and communities, as well as business itself in the long run, before and during development.\u201d"

The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact.",
      "Panama\u2019s decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.",
      "Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade.",
      "Despite that, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway and could lead to a rebidding process.",
      "A drop in water levels in the canal due to drought has slowed transit through the canal, raising further complaints from Trump, although the delays appear to have nothing to do with China.",
      "Lin said the Belt and Road Initiative has brought \u201cactive participation\u201d from over 150 countries and that it has brought \u201cfruitful results\u201d to Panama and China, but gave no examples.",
      "\u201cWe hope Panama will bear in mind the general picture of bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both peoples, resist external interference, and make the right decision,\u201d Lin said.",

      "\u201cIt was quite natural at the end of the year to do extra shipments,\u201d said the trade association president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, given the uncertainty over whether tariffs would hit Italian wines or not \u2014 and the likelihood consumers would cut back on such luxuries if tariffs made them too pricey.",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",

      "U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate fell to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised November and December payrolls higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate fell to 4% to start 2025.",
      "The first job report of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency suggested that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular. January job creation was down from the 263,000 added in November, and the 307,000 created in December. Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January.",
      "Most Americans still enjoy unusual job security. But for those looking for work, the job hunt has been getting harder as the labor market cools from the red-hot hiring days of 2021-2023.",
      "Average hourly wages rose by 0.5% from December and 4.1% from January 2024, coming in a bit hotter than forecasters had expected \u2013 news that might be disappointing to the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. The Labor Department also revised payrolls for November and December up by a combined 100,000.",
      "Citing the strong upward revisions from late 2024, Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics wrote that \"There is no cause for concern about the strength of the economy in today\u2019s employment report.'' But they added that the decent hiring over the past three months suggested the Fed will be in no hurry to cut interest rates again after cutting three times in 2024.",
      "Healthcare companies added 44,000 jobs, down from a 2024 average of 57,000. Retailers hired 34,000 workers. And government at all levels added 32,000 jobs. Mining companies shed 8,000 jobs.",
      "The future is cloudier.",
      "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed Jan. 20 is a \u201cnegative for employment growth,\u2019\u2019 Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week. The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment data.",
      "Economists are also worried about Trump\u2019s threat to wage a trade war against other countries. He\u2019s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from China.",
      "Canada and Mexico \u2013 America\u2019s two largest trading partners -- remain in his crosshairs though he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25% tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for negotiations. Trump says that America\u2019s two neighbors and allies haven\u2019t done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. Trump is also itching to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing to America\u2019s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to $236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters unfairly.",
      "The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation \u2013 which has fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job creation.",
      "The job market has already lost momentum. American payrolls increased by 2 million last year, down from 2.6 million in 2023, 4.6 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December \u2013 still a decent number by historical standards.",
      "As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December\u2019s 3.2 million, which is below pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In regular annual revisions, the Labor Department reported Friday that job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 wasn\u2019t as good as originally reported: 589,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months. Preliminary estimates, released in August, had suggested the revisions would be bigger \u2014 818,000 jobs.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's Justice Department has disbanded a Biden-era program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The move to disband Task Force KleptoCapture is one of several moves undertaken by the Justice Department under the new leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi that presage a different approach toward Russia and national security issues.",
      "The department also ended the Foreign Influence Task Force, which was established in the first Trump administration to police influence campaigns staged by Russia and other nations aimed at sowing discord, undermining democracy and spreading disinformation. The U.S. government in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election aggressively moved to disrupt propaganda campaigns by Russia, which officials have assessed had a preference for Trump.",
      "In a memo addressed to all employees Wednesday \u2014 the first day of Bondi's tenure \u2014 the attorney general's office stated that \u201cattorneys assigned to those initiatives shall return to their prior posts, and resources currently devoted to those efforts shall be committed to the total elimination of Cartels and TCOs\u201d \u2014 an acronym for Transnational Criminal Organizations.",

      "In the days after last week's plane collision in Washington, Pete Muntean was a fixture on the air at CNN",
      "NEW YORK -- Summoned from his couch to cover last week's plane disaster in Washington, CNN's Pete Muntean rushed in for the first of 24 live reports over the next 48 hours. At one point, he used a model airplane and helicopter to demonstrate. At another, he called President Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d for speculating that diversity in hiring contributed to the crash.",
      "Even regular viewers may have wondered: Who is Pete Muntean, anyway?",
      "As CNN's aviation correspondent and a pilot who has flown near where the collision that killed 67 people took place, Muntean illustrates the changes in what used to be an important specialty in journalism.",
      "Precise numbers are hard to come by. But simply by the content out there, there are fewer reporters concentrating solely on what is a complex and technical beat, both because of how the business has changed and the relative safety of flying.",
      "\u201cI realized that planes weren't crashing and I needed a new beat,\u201d said Bill Adair, a former reporter who wrote a book, \u201cThe Mystery of Flight 427: Inside a Crash Investigation,\u201d about a 1994 plane crash in western Pennsylvania that killed 132 people. \u201cThat's a good thing.\u201d",
      "Adair switched to politics, and later created the fact-checking website PolitiFact.",
      "Muntean, 36, was born for his job. Both of his parents were pilots, and he kept his passion for aviation even after his mother, Nancy Lynn, died when the plane she was flying in a Virginia air show crashed. Muntean was 18 at the time and witnessed it; he was the show's MC.",
      "Shortly after, he flew his first solo flight. He keeps a plane at a small Maryland airport now and takes to the sky when time allows.",
      "\u201cI don't think I could ever leave it,\u201d he said. \u201cI love flying more than anything, and the next best thing is talking about it.\u201d",
      "Muntean believes a major part of his job is translation, trying to put into plain English terminology that non-pilots can get lost in. He tries not to be glum about tragedies he occasionally needs to cover. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the guy who makes people afraid of flying,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is a real drag.\u201d",
      "Aviation is his beat, but like many reporters who follow the industry now, it's not his sole area of concentration. He covers transportation in general. Tom Costello covers aviation for NBC News, but he also covers transportation, cybersecurity, space travel and economics. Jon Scott's main job is as a news anchor for Fox News but, as a pilot, he's involved in major aviation stories.",
      "The New York Times splits things up: Niraj Chokshi covers aviation and transportation, Mark Walker follows the National Transporation Safety Board and Christine Chung follows the airline industry from a consumer perspective. David Koenig was airlines writer for The Associated Press until his recent retirement; the AP says his job will be filled.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of good reporters that cover aviation, but they are fewer than ever,\u201d said Jon Ostrower, who has covered the industry for CNN and The Wall Street Journal and is now editor-in-chief of The Air Current, a subscription-based aviation news service.",
      "The news industry's economic struggles means there are less specialists in general in newsrooms. With safety a major component of the aviation beat, the fact that the last major U.S. commercial air crash before last week came in 2009 means there is less to do.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with editors,\u201d Adair said. \u201cIf you have limited resources, there is not a lot of merit in putting a reporter on a beat where things are working well.\u201d",
      "Airline ownership consolidation means there are fewer reporters at regional newspapers knowledgeable about the industry because they have to follow the local company, Ostrower said. That assumes there are even many reporters at hollowed-out newspapers to do that.",
      "There's also much more flight tracking information easily available to the public through services like Flightradar24 and ADS-B Exchange than in years past. While helpful for journalists, that also increases the preponderance of armchair investigators clogging the Internet with less-than-informed theories, Ostrower said. And entities that offered training for reporters on aviation issues, including companies like Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, don't do it anymore, he said.",
      "To some experts, the shrinking of ranks on the aviation beat wasn't necessarily apparent after the Washington crash. Where it's likely to be noticed is in the weeks and months after, when the time comes to closely examine mechanical issues and policies that might need to be changed to prevent a recurrence.",
      "Who will be watching to see what lessons are learned?",
      "\u201cWe've witnessed the dismantling of the department store approach to news,\u201d said veteran science reporter Miles O'Brien. \u201cEveryone has a little boutique now. You can find experts, but it is incumbent upon the consumer to find trusted sources.\u201d",
      "O'Brien and Ostrower have something in common: they've both been laid off by CNN. Cutbacks may have taken O'Brien's regular job, but producers come calling when news happens \u2014 so much so that he was put on a retainer by his old employer.",

      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.",
      "Schwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.",
      "The case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.",
      "The Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.",
      "Sandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Sandersville isn\u2019t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,\u201d Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. \u201cBut we won\u2019t rest easy until we know for sure that they\u2019ll never be able to take our land from us.\u201d",
      "Brian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement \u201cto return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have \u201cminimal impacts\u201d on neighbors.",
      "Some people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.",
      "Supporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.",
      "Railroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for \u201cpublic use.\u201d Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.",
      "Schwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the \u201cfunctioning\u201d of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.\u201d",
      "The group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.",
      "The libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad\u2019s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia\u2019s eminent domain laws,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement."

      "Fortunately for investors, finding lower-fee funds has become easier every year as the industry feels pressure to compete for investors. Across all U.S. stock mutual funds, investors are paying about 42 cents in fees for every $100 invested, according to the latest 2023 data from Investment Company Institute.

The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low just above 6% last September, but has been mostly rising since then, echoing a sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 3.62% in mid-September, reached 4.79% three weeks ago amid fears inflation may remain stubbornly higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target. A solid U.S. economy and worries about tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump have also helped push bond yields higher.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.43% in midday trading Thursday.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, prolonging a national home sales slump that began in 2022.",
      "While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in December for the third month in a row, 2024 was the worst year for home sales in nearly 30 years, worse than 2023, which had been the worst in decades.",
      "New data on pending home sales points to potentially further declines in coming months. The National Association of Realtor\u2019s pending home sales index fell 5.5% in December from the previous month, ending a four-month streak of increases.",
      "A lag of a month or two usually exists between when a contract is signed and when the home sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "For those hoping that mortgage rates will retreat significantly, economists say that\u2019s unlikely.",
      "Forecasts mostly call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year, with some economists including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged last week after cutting it three times in a row to close 2024, a sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue."

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore..",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffee or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for an afternoon siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d"

      "PANAMA CITY -- Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department\u2019s claim that his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department\u2019s statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI completely reject that statement yesterday,\u201d Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama\u2019s ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department\u2019s statement. He was scheduled to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said via X that \u201cU.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\u201d",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route earlier this week, said on Thursday from the Dominican Republic that he had no confusion about his discussions with Panama, but \u201cI respect very much the fact that Panama has a process of laws and procedures that they need to follow.\u201d",

I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.\u201d",

      "Rubio had told Mulino that Trump believed that China\u2019s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the United States to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.",
      "Canal administrators said they were open to discussing giving U.S. warships priority in crossing the canal, but did not say they had considered waiving fees.",
      "Mulino said via X that he was scheduled to speak to Trump on Friday.",
      "Since 1998, U.S. warships, including submarines, have transited the Panama Canal 994 times. They accounted for just 0.3% of the canal\u2019s traffic during that period. The canal received $25.4 million in total fees for those crossings, according to data from the canal authority.",
      "The fees charged to U.S. warships and those from other nations are based on the ship\u2019s displacement tonnage, or the weight of the water displaced by the vessel. The measure is different than that used to charge commercial vessels.",
      "Mulino said Thursday that both Panama\u2019s constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees. \u201cIt\u2019s a constitutional limitation,\u201d he said.",

      "The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday even though inflation remains above its target",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday, even though inflation remains above its target.",
      "Most economists think the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will lower the bank's main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. The base rate helps dictate how expensive it is for individuals to take out a mortgage or a loan, while also influencing the returns offered by banks on savings.",
      "Of particular interest to financial markets is what the bank's accompanying economic forecasts show and the tone of Gov. Andrew Bailey in his ensuing press briefing.",
      "\u201cUntil now, the bank has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\u201d said Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "The rate-setting panel is tasked with ensuring that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so.",
      "Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel's ability to cut.",
      "Official figures earlier this month showed a surprise decline in the inflation rate to 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy.",
      "Another potential reason for rate-setters to cut borrowing rates is that economic growth in the U.K. has stagnated, which will likely put downward pressure on inflation.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

      "Hubie Brown taught basketball as an elective when he took his first college coaching job in 1968",
      "Hubie Brown had just taken his first college coaching job in 1968 and didn't expect that he'd also be asked to teach.",
      "So, for his one year as an assistant at William & Mary, he taught two elective basketball courses.",
      "Brown, now 91 and set to work his final game as a broadcaster, never stopped teaching the sport in more than 55 years since. Only his audience grew from college students to players, coaches and TV viewers all over the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most remarkable thing and it\u2019s not hyperbole: He has probably taught more people about the game of basketball than anybody that\u2019s ever lived,\u201d broadcasting partner Mike Breen said.",
      "Brown and Breen will work ABC's telecast of Sunday's game between Philadelphia and Milwaukee, where Brown got his first NBA opportunity as an assistant coach with the Bucks teams featuring Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson in 1972.",
      "For the next five decades, he'd move from the coach's box to the TV table and back, earning induction in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005 for his contributions to basketball.",
      "Brown has called 18 NBA Finals between TV and radio during his 35 years as a national TV and radio analyst. Yet he says he'll be nervous Sunday as he was doing every game, despite his extraordinary preparation that included watching both teams play at least twice in the week beforehand.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always nervous,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s me. I don\u2019t worry about anybody else. Because you want to be able to paint the picture, you want to be able to educate the fan to another level of expertise, and you realize it\u2019s a team doing it, not yourself.\u201d",
      "The team, for Brown, is his partner along with the director and producer. The time they spend together preparing, becoming like family, reminds him of coaching.",
      "Not surprisingly, his players recognize aspects of his coaching in his broadcasting.",
      "\u201cI used to love listening to him, because he was quite different than any other broadcaster that was on the air,\u201d said Hall of Famer Bernard King, who led the NBA in scoring while playing for Brown with the New York Knicks in 1984-85.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that the fans that love basketball, the intricacies of the game, he would help the viewer understand exactly what happened and why it happened. And so the viewers are being educated as they watch the game, not just being entertained, and that was a high mark of what he did as a broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Those who listened through the years recognized some of Brown's trademarks, such as calling the lane \u201cthe painted area,\" and offering strategy tips for a team by saying \u201cyou must.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy favorite is when he was really happy about a play, like he\u2019d always say: \u2018That\u2019s it! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s it!\u2019\u201d Breen said. \u201cAnd then when he got mad, you could tell when he got mad, when you weren\u2019t playing the game right, just in the tone in his voice.\u201d",
      "Brown was so detailed in his own coaching that King said the Knicks even had a specific play for when an opponent missed a free throw, called power right, in which the forward would sprint down the left side, cut across the lane and post up on the right block.",
      "So when Brown was impressed with what other coaches ran, he wanted to highlight it.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s always a tribute to the coaching staff for preparing their teams, and you never want to not be able to emphasize that to the fans when you see it,\u201d he said.",
      "Brown had no experience and no plans for TV when he was first approached to do work for USA Network in 1981. He would return to coaching the next year with the Knicks, and then it was back to broadcasting from the time he left in the 1986-87 season until returning to coaching in 2002 with Memphis, where he would win his second NBA Coach of the Year award.",
      "Even when Brown finished there, he wasn't done being a coach. Breen was calling the NBA Finals on ABC for the first time in 2006 and was nervous, trying too hard to follow instructions to tailor his vocabulary toward first-time viewers the event would draw.",
      "At the first timeout, while Miami and Dallas were getting their instructions, Brown gave some of his own.",
      "\u201cHe grabbed me by the arm \u2014 and grabbed it tight \u2014 and he looked me in the eye and he says, \u2018Just call the game the way you always call it and we\u2019ll be fine,\u2019\u201d Breen said. \u201cAnd it just relaxed me.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, it will be Breen's turn to help Brown through after a difficult last year in which both his wife and son died.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not interested in people showering him with love and tributes,\u201d Breen said. \u201cBut the goal is to let him analyze the game like he always does, teach the game to the viewers, but at the same time pay him the tribute that he deserves, because he\u2019s given his life to the game.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Age is more than just a number to LeBron James.",
      "It's also a target.",
      "The 40-year-old James became the oldest player to score 40 points in an NBA game Thursday night, putting up a season-high 42 in the Los Angeles Lakers' 120-112 victory over the Golden State Warriors.",
      "James passed the record held by Michael Jordan, his idol and the only other NBA player to score 40 after his 40th birthday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m old, that\u2019s my take,\u201d James said when asked about his latest achievement. \u201cI need a glass of wine and some sleep, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "Jordan did it for the Washington Wizards just three days after turning 40 in February 2003. James is 38 days removed from his 40th birthday last Dec. 30 \u2014 and it seems highly unlikely this will be the last time he hits the mark, since the top scorer in NBA history is still playing phenomenal basketball deep in his record-tying 22nd NBA season.",
      "This feat is a remarkable bookend for James as well: He also is the youngest player in NBA history to score 40 points in a game.",
      "James first hit the mark 88 days after his 19th birthday on March 27, 2004, scoring 41 as a rookie for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the New Jersey Nets.",
      "\u201cThroughout my journey, anytime I\u2019ve been named or put in a category of whatever the case, to cross paths with the greats is always humbling,\u201d James said. \u201cJust to know where I come from and I love the game so much, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d",
      "James also grabbed a season-high 17 rebounds and added eight assists while carrying the Lakers down the stretch against the Warriors and 36-year-old Stephen Curry, who put up 37 points in defeat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve run out of words and superlatives and descriptions to capture what he\u2019s doing at this stage of his career and at this age,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \u201cIt continues to be remarkable. It really does, and he really led us tonight. AR having an off shooting night, and we needed all of that offense from LeBron.\u201d",
      "James is still making NBA history while he waits to begin his new partnership with Luka Doncic, who watched his new teammate's domination from the bench for the second straight game since arriving in a trade with Dallas. Doncic is likely to make his Lakers debut on Monday night at home against Utah.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait, because everything I do on the floor, he has the ability to do it or do it even better,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s how great he is. Even at his young age, 25, he\u2019s such a unique player. He\u2019s a special player, a generational talent, so I\u2019m super-appreciative to be able to share the floor with him and then watch him do his thing.\u201d",
      "James was outstanding all night against the Warriors. He scored 18 points in the second quarter in a spree highlighted by three 3-pointers in 38 seconds \u2014 the third from the Lakers' logo at midcourt. He basked in a standing ovation from the Lakers crowd while teammate Rui Hachimura placed an imaginary crown on his head.",
      "James then stepped up down the stretch when the Lakers' 26-point lead dwindled to five in the fourth quarter. Golden State trailed by only six when James drained his sixth 3-pointer of the night with 1:08 to play, and he followed it with a half-court assist to Hachimura for a dunk that essentially sealed the win with 49 seconds left.",
      "James didn't quite manage a triple-double against the Warriors, falling just short for the second straight game. He is the second-oldest player in NBA history to record a triple-double, and he's still about 90 days too young to break the record set by Karl Malone in 2003.",
      "James has 10 triple-doubles this season, each one making him the second-oldest player to accomplish the feat.",

So I\u2019m trying to find that balance of maintaining my life and still trying to do this somewhat insane thing that I\u2019m doing.\"",

You know, it\u2019s not always happy. But in general I\u2019m very lucky. \u2026 So I\u2019m not happier because I\u2019m skiing. I\u2019m happy in general and I\u2019m lucky to be able to do something that I enjoy doing so much.\u201d",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Dublin will host Ireland\u2019s first NFL regular-season game when the Pittsburgh Steelers play at historic Croke Park in 2025, the league announced Friday, two days before the Chiefs and Eagles meet in the Super Bowl.",
      "The Irish capital joins Madrid and Berlin as first-time hosts next season as the league expands its global footprint. It announced earlier this week that an NFL game would be played at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia in 2026.",
      "The Steelers have long-standing ties to the Emerald Isle and a partnership with the Gaelic Athletic Association, which operates Croke Park, the principal national stadium of Ireland. The date and Pittsburgh's opponent will be announced this spring.",
      "\u201cI think the emotion you hear from all of us is the excitement to bring a regular-season game to Ireland with the Steelers, and how special that will be, and yes, it ultimately comes back to the fans,\u201d said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's executive vice president for international events. \u201cWe see Irish fans travel to games in London or Germany or elsewhere, but this is a game on Irish soil, in Dublin, at Croke Park, and an opportunity to create an incredible atmosphere.\u201d",
      "The Steelers have home games scheduled next season against AFC North rivals Baltimore, Cincinnati and Cleveland along with the Bills, Dolphins, Packers, Vikings, Colts and Seahawks.",

That said, my sense is there are a lot of clubs who are interested in being part of this historic game. This is a big first in a market that a lot of people are excited about.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think our focus in growing our game globally is growing all levels of the game,\u201d O'Reilly said, \u201cand seeing college football and the partnership they have in Dublin over these recent years, that's a good thing overall.\u201d",
      "The Rooney family that founded and still owns the Steelers has deep roots in Ireland. It can trace its lineage to the town of Newry in County Down, before the family emigrated to Canada and eventually the U.S. in the 1800s. The late Daniel M. Rooney was U.S. ambassador to Ireland from 2009-12, and members of the family continue to have close ties to the nation.",
      "\u201cGrowing up around my grandfather, and my father, one of the lessons they have always taught us is our strong connection to Ireland, and how meaningful Ireland is to the family,\u201d said Daniel Martin Rooney, the son of Steelers president Art Rooney II, who serves as the team\u2019s director of business development. \u201cThis is truly a dream come true for our franchise.\u201d",
      "The Steelers hold marketing rights in both Ireland and Northern Ireland as part of the league\u2019s Global Markets Program, which allows teams to hold events and sign commercial deals in those locations.",
      "The franchise has built support on the island through its partnership with the Gaelic Athletic Association. The organization manages and promotes Gaelic games, including Gaelic football and hurling. It also is hugely influential in Irish society given its historical significance to Irish independence.",
      "As international consumer markets go, Ireland would be by far the smallest that the NFL has entered so far.",

      "\u201cI challenge any venue to age like this one has,\u201d Payton, now with the Denver Broncos, said while visiting New Orleans for Super Bowl-related festivities this week.",
      "On Sunday, the hulking, 70,000-seat, triple-decker stadium \u2014 an unmistakable figure in the New Orleans skyline with its champagne-colored metallic sheen and hourglass shape \u2014 will host a Super Bowl for the eighth time.",
      "Payton surmised the Superdome has housed more special moments in sports history than perhaps any stadium in existence now, \u201cand hopefully more this weekend.\u201d",
      "Nearly $1 billion has been spent on repairs and upgrades to the Superdome since Hurricane Katrina tore a hole in the roof while the stadium was sheltering thousands of New Orleans residents from the storm on Aug. 29, 2005.",
      "About $600 million has been spent to upgrade the dome since it last hosted a Super Bowl in 2013, according to Doug Thornton, an executive vice president for ASM Global, a company which manages sports and entertainment venues around the world, including the state-owned Superdome.",
      "Interior ramps were removed and replaced with soaring escalators and modern interior design features that give spacious areas just inside several main entrances the look like modern, upscale hotel lobbies.",
      "Fans \u201cwant to be able to walk and talk\" during games,\" Thornton said. \"Particularly the younger generations that come to the games, they want to hang out with their friends.\u201d",
      "Some seating areas in the corners of the two upper levels have been removed to open up gathering decks with panoramic views of the field and surrounding stands.",
      "Those areas give the dome \"a much more open feeling,\" Thornton said. \"And when you\u2019re sitting in your seats, you can actually see through that view corridor to the exterior where there\u2019s exterior glass\u201d letting in natural light.",
      "The exterior windows are difficult to see from the outside because of horizontal aluminum slats that were meant to help them blend in to the exterior skin.",
      "Louisiana's state architectural board \u201cdoes not want to do anything that would disturb the exterior facade because of the historical significance of the architecture,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt was one of the first buildings of its kind to be designed that way. It\u2019s got a timeless look.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Superdome's expansive, 13-acre footprint and its 2 million square feet of interior space have given architects flexibility to periodically update the building, outfitting it over time with with new sideline clubs behind the first two levels of seating and field-level suites behind one end zone.",
      "Concourses also have widened, while bathroom and concession areas have been expanded and updated.",
      "Video boards also have been updated and enlarged since the last Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cThe original design to me is quite remarkable for many reasons,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cOne, the sheer volume of building has allowed us to do all this work. This stadium is the same size today as modern stadiums. But it was designed more than 50 years ago.\u201d",
      "The venerable venue not only has hosted seven previous Super Bowls, but also six NCAA men's Final Fours and five college football national championships since the BCS system (which evolved into the College Football Playoff) began in 1998.

      "TickPick co-CEO Brett Goldberg said there were a number of reasons why ticket prices are notably lower than last year.",
      "That game was the first in Las Vegas, creating even more fan interest than usual. The close proximity of Allegiant Stadium to the nation's eighth-busiest airport and Las Vegas Strip entertainment corrider that includes many of the world's largest hotels contributed to record prices.",
      "Hotel capacity in New Orleans is more limited with about 26,000 rooms in the city center, and even home rentals are at a premium.",
      "\u201cIf you try to go book a hotel right now, it's very challenging,\u201d Goldberg said.",

      "\u201cI think if the Bills won, you would've seen a very different dynamic here,\u201d Goldberg said. \"There's a part of that (Chiefs) fan base that can afford to go to the Super Bowl three times, but that's a very small (segment of the) fan base that could do that.",
      "\u201cEven the Eagles have a little bit of a fatigue from being at a Super Bowl two years ago. We're hearing directly from fans, \u2018I went two years ago. I\u2019m not sure I could pull this off.' Would they love to go? Sure, but the impracticality on it's a $10,000 trip for two becomes very limiting.\u201d",
      "Goldberg said he hasn't received feedback that the New Year's Day terrorist attack in which 14 people were killed by a motorist on Bourbon Street played a significant part in the price decline.",
      "New Orleans is about to host its 11th Super Bowl, though first in 12 years.",
      "But the been-there, done-that feel is another factor, Goldberg said, and one Las Vegas could eventually face as well at one point.",
      "\u201cBy the time you do it a third time, the stadium won't be as new,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cI do think it could lose some of its appeal.\u201d",

      "Dealing with the absence of star freshman Liam McNeeley for much of January and some inconsistent play, the two-time defending national champion UConn Huskies looked like a title contender in their first game in February with a win at Marquette",
      "STORRS, Conn. -- There might not be a team happier to see January in the rear-view mirror than two-time defending national champion UConn.",
      "On the way to a second straight title during the 2023-24 season, not only did the Huskies go undefeated in January, but they never trailed by double digits in those eight games.",
      "What a difference a year makes. With four starters selected in the 2024 NBA Draft and an injury sidelining talented freshman Liam McNeeley, UConn had to battle its way through every game in January. The No. 19 Huskies needed overtime to win at home against a Butler team with one Big East win. Just over a week later, the Huskies figured to have an easier team when a DePaul team that recently snapped a 39-game regular-season conference losing streak came to Connecticut. The Huskies had to overcome a 14-point deficit before winning by 11.",
      "That game was part of a stretch when the Huskies trailed by at least 10 points four times in seven games. Even the five wins in January were a bit of a grind.",
      "\u201cIt is stressful to play at UConn,\u201d coach Dan Hurley said. \"When you are not as good as we have been, it is uncharted territory for Alex (Karaban), Samson (Johnson), Hassan (Diarra), Solo (Ball), Jaylin (Stewart) and Jayden (Ross). They are not used to playing as many games like this, they are used to dominance. I think even the new guys \u2014 Tarris (Reed Jr.) and Aidan (Mahaney), it is a different kind of pressure when you play at a place like UConn.\"",
      "A turning point for UConn seemed to come late in the first half and the second half of the Jan. 29 game against DePaul. The Huskies used that momentum to look like a team that came into the season as one of the favorites to win the national title by winning at Marquette a few days later.",
      "\u201cIt helped us tremendously,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe more we got to be together and work as one, it turned the game around. We had a big turnaround, we were down (14) in the first half and we ended up turning it around and winning by 11. The last 26 minutes were UConn basketball.\u201d",
      "More \"UConn basketball' was on display when the Huskies went on the road and won against a top-10 Marquette team in its first game in February. Even that game showed some of the flaws of this year's UConn team.",
      "The Huskies committed 25 turnovers and allowed Marquette to come down with 17 offensive rebounds. Led by a career-high 25 points from Ball, the Huskies shot 59% in the game and 63% on 3-pointers en route to the 77-69 victory.",
      "\u201cIt was a testament to the shooting numbers,\u201d Hurley said. \"There was a stretch in the second half when we weren\u2019t desperate enough or urgent enough. It has been the story of the season. These are things that we haven\u2019t done this year that our past teams have done.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the win but we don\u2019t play with that tenacity that our past teams have played with. We got bailed out by Solo had a crazy shooting night and Alex hit a late shot-clock (shot).\u201d",
      "Hurley thought it was going to be a struggle following the departures of Stephon Castle, Donovan Clingan, Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer. However, he didn't think the journey would be quite this bumpy.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do is incredibly hard,\u201d Hurley said. \"The former national champs that went back-to-back, they returned their whole team or at least all the stars from their team. What we did last year going back-to-back with only returning two starters, nobody had done that before. Now we are trying to do something that has never been done before, it is not going to be easy.\"",
      "The good news is that McNeeley could be back when UConn plays at home against No. 12 St. John's on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWhen Liam was on the court, we were playing to a top-12 level,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cHis absence has caused a lot of problems for this team that this team can\u2019t overcome at this point. We just have to find a way to battle until we get whole again.\u201d",
      "With nearly a week off since the Marquette game, ailing point guard Diarra and McNeeley should be among the UConn players who will benefit additional recovery time.",
      "UConn went 3-5 in January during the 2022-23 season and turned things around in time to win the national title. Time will tell if the Huskies can follow that script once again.",

      "\u201cOhio State Football has long been defined by excellence and, under Ryan Day\u2019s leadership, that tradition has not only continued, but thrived,\u201d athletic director Ross Bjork said. \u201cAs a leader, mentor and coach, Ryan has consistently demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the success and well-being of our players, both on and off the field. His leadership has maintained our position of national prominence each year and winning the 2024 national championship validated his program\u2019s culture of excellence, integrity, and perseverance.\"",
      "The Buckeyes finished 14-2, losing by one point at Oregon in the regular season before avenging that loss in the playoffs.",
      "Day is 70-10 in six seasons, an .875 winning percentage that ranks first among active head coaches. He thanked university president Ted Carter, Bjork and the trustees for their confidence in him. He also thanked his assistant coaches and players.",

    "title": "Edwards and Rudd walked away from NASCAR and never looked back. Their reunion is at the Hall of Fame",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 12:02:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Carl Edwards and Ricky Rudd had very little overlap in their respective NASCAR careers",
    "story": [
      "Carl Edwards and Ricky Rudd had very little overlap in their respective NASCAR careers",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carl Edwards and Ricky Rudd had very little overlap in their respective NASCAR careers.",
      "Edwards only entered the elite Cup Series in 2004 \u2014 a mere 67 races before Rudd ended his 32-year career \u2014 so the two never got a chance to know one another.",
      "But two things tie Edwards and Rudd together \u2014 when each decided to retire, both essentially vanished from the NASCAR scene, and, on Friday night they will return to their old racing community as inductees of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.",
      "Edwards and Rudd are among five being celebrated Friday night as the newest members of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.",
      "Rudd made his first re-appearance in 2024 when Roger Penske tried to wrangle all living Indianapolis Motor Speedway winners for a photo at the track to celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Brickyard. Many of his former competitors were shocked to see him on the Yard of Bricks; it was the first time most had seen Rudd since his final Cup Series race in 2007.",
      "Rudd, who doesn't go to the race track because he doesn't feel there's any role or reason for him to be there, told The Associated Press he was surprised by the warm reception he received at Indianapolis that day.",
      "\u201cThink about it, we went to 30 some races, went to the same towns, stayed in the same \u2014 we called it the \u2018trailer park\u2019 \u2014 so it's like moving out of a neighborhood,\" said Rudd, whose 1997 Brickyard victory was one of 23 career Cup wins.",
      "\u201cAnd you come back to that neighborhood and there are a lot of familiarities. Walking through the garage at Indy, it was really neat reconnecting again with many of those guys,\u201d Rudd said.",
      "Edwards abruptly retired after the 2016 season, at the age of 36, after losing out on a second opportunity to win a Cup championship with a controversial title-deciding season finale. He told the AP he didn't call it a retirement at the time because he left himself room to possibly just take a one-year break.",
      "But just like Rudd, Edwards left NASCAR in his rearview mirror. He was in the wind until he was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest drivers, an event that was celebrated at Darlington Raceway in 2023. Edwards joined the Fox Sports television booth for part of that day's race \u2014 where he turned out to be a spectacular broadcaster \u2014 and caught the audience up on what he'd been doing the past seven years.",
      "And just like Rudd, he was astonished at the reception.",
      "\u201cI understand now when people say \u2018NASCAR is a family,\u201d\u2019 Edwards told the AP. \u201cI finally get it. I do. When I walked away, I really thought \u2018I\u2019m giving this up completely. I'm giving up the sport, the opportunity to drive and a lot of friendships.' I'm shocked that NASCAR invited me back in this way. For the first time, I truly feel like it is part of a family.\u201d",
      "Neither Edwards nor Rudd won a Cup title, but they left memorable marks on NASCAR.",
      "Rudd was one of the toughest drivers of all time \u2014 he used duct tape to keep his swollen and bruised eyes open to ensure he wouldn't miss the Daytona 500 after suffering serious injuries in a wreck the week before \u2014 and his 788 consecutive Cup starts was a longtime NASCAR record broken by Jeff Gordon's 797.",
      "But what else would you expect from Rudd, who as one of five kids growing up in Chesapeake, Virginia, was a self-proclaimed \u201cemergency-room regular.\u201d He was pretending to be Superman when he jumped off the roof when he was 5, was the only kid in town to ride a pony in his backyard, and was so determined to do all the dangerous actions his friends were scared to do, he figured he'd one day be a Hollywood stuntman.",
      "He instead found his way into NASCAR. He ran for small teams, for big teams, his own team \u2014 10 different owners, in all. Rudd was one of the best road racers of his time and earned six of his victories, including the Brickyard, driving for Rudd Performance Motorsports.",
      "Rudd was the 1977 Cup Series Rookie of the Year, finished a career-best second in points in 1991, and scored at least one win in 16 consecutive seasons, tied for the third-longest streak in Cup Series history.",
      "\u201cYou set out your goals and it really was \u2018Try to win every race,\u2019\" Rudd said. \u201cI didn't really look at the big picture, so my career goal was always just to win every race I could.\u201d",
      "Edwards entered NASCAR at its financial heyday \u2014 maybe the toughest time in history to break into the sport. Edwards was a substitute teacher trying to be a racer and handed out business cards at tracks that read: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a driver, you\u2019re looking for me.\"",
      "Jack Roush gave him his break and Edwards climbed from Trucks, to the Xfinity Series and finally Cup while captivating the audience with backflips off his winning car.",
      "He once ran across the finish line at Talladega Superspeedway just to complete the event after his car had sailed into the fence on the final lap as he raced Brad Keselowski for the win.",
      "On the track, he eventually left Roush to join Joe Gibbs Racing for a better chance to win an elusive Cup title. He'd lost the 2011 Cup in a heartbreaking tie-breaker to Tony Stewart. And he was leading the finale in 2016 when a questionable late caution set up a final restart and Edwards was wrecked.",
      "And then he quit.",
      "Edwards just simply walked away from a career that produced 72 wins across the three national series, and 28 were in Cup and included the Coca-Cola 600 and the Southern 500. But he also had two of the cruelest championship defeats, both in NASCAR's playoff system.",
      "Edwards occasionally pops up doing rescue and recovery work in his home state of Missouri, where he's long been courted to run for public office and doesn't rule it out. He's never totally transparent about why he truly left NASCAR \u2014 some will never be convinced it was because he felt NASCAR cheated him out of two titles \u2014 but he's always been an extremely private person and remains that way as he heads into the Hall of Fame.",
      "He doesn't offer much about how he spends his days, he just says he keeps busy, and prefers to talk more broadly about his career and current life. He says he plans to be at the track some in 2025, and that he'd be interested in television work.",
      "One thing Edwards, who is a pilot, did reveal is that he's become a serious sailor and captained (with a crew) his own ship abroad. He's been building a boat the last three years that he intends to sail all over the world with his family.",
      "He's truly content.",
      "\u201cI used to think that I worked really hard and I did all this stuff and it was because of all my dedication and persistence,\" Edwards said. \u201cNow, the more I see at 45 years old, after living a little bit more of life, it is simply that I was the most blessed person on early. All the pieces fell into place for me to get to do something that I only dreamed about. I'm truly just realizing how fortunate I am.\u201d",

    "summary": "The century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline really tight",
    "story": [
      "The century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline really tight",
      "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy -- In Sochi, workers were still hammering away in the media village and shower water ran yellow when journalists from around the world arrived for the 2014 Winter Games.",
      "The chaotic preparations for the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro were labeled the \u201cworst\u201d ever by a vice president of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "The next Olympics, though, might set an unofficial record for running late on preparations.",
      "That\u2019s because the century-old sliding center being completely rebuilt for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Games is pushing the deadline so tight that the IOC has gone so far as to demand a Plan B option that would require moving bobsled, luge and skeleton events all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy isn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "Thursday marks exactly one year to go before the Feb. 6, 2026 opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium and the track in Cortina is still a half-completed construction site.",
      "The IOC has set a deadline for the end of next month for pre-certification of the Cortina track and nobody is saying for sure if it will pass the test.",
      "But Fabio Saldini, the Italian government commissioner in charge of the 118 million euro ($123 million) project, told The Associated Press during a recent visit that almost 70% of the track was completed \u2014 even if it was tough to tell inside the muddy and chaotic construction site.",
      "With 180 people working from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. every day to build the sliding center, the first ice is slated to be laid down on the track at the start of March.",
      "\u201cWe have huge support from the construction firms, the government and (Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo) Salvini,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWith everyone\u2019s support, we will be able to finish in time.\u201d",
      "Construction began less than a year ago and no sliding track has been built in such a short timeframe. An official test event is slated for October, a step that has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "The IOC would have preferred to use an active track in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead of rebuilding the Cortina venue, which had been closed since 2008. But it let the local organizing committee select the Plan B option.",
      "\u201cWe chose Lake Placid because it was the only place where they offered us the track without requiring us to make any investments,\u201d Milan-Cortina CEO Andrea Varnier told AP. \u201cBut we\u2019re counting on holding the sliding sports here in Cortina.\u201d",
      "Added organizing committee president Giovanni Malag\u00f2 about the Lake Placid backup plan: \u201cIt's just a formality. There's no substance to it.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have protested over climate damage due to the Cortina track's reconstruction.",
      "\u201cThere were 800 trees cut down,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cBut they were not all 100 years old, like some people said. And we\u2019re going to plant 10,000 trees when we\u2019re done.\u201d",
      "General ticket sales for the games are about to start following a pre-registration process that drew in more than 350,000 requests \u2014 70% of them from abroad from more than 210 countries.",
      "Sliding is one of the Games\u2019 most inexpensive attractions with luge events going for as low as 40 euros ($42) and bobsled for a maximum of 100 euros ($104).",
      "But what happens for ticket holders if the sliding track in Cortina isn\u2019t ready and events are moved to Lake Placid?",
      "\u201cIt will be a whole different experience,\u201d said Paul Caine, the president of hospitality package provider On Location, about the prospect of moving from glitzy Cortina to upstate New York.",
      "Caine noted that while \u201cnobody wanted to go to Tahiti\u201d for surfing events in French Polynesia during last year\u2019s Paris Games, hospitality packages were sold for the sailing competitions in Marseille, which is located in southern France \u2014 3 \u00bd hours by train from Paris.",
      "On Location has received requests for hospitality packages from 62 countries so far, with ice hockey, biathlon and figure skating the most popular sports.",
      "Private boxes for the opening ceremony at the iconic San Siro soccer stadium have already sold out.",
      "These are the first Games to fully embrace cost-cutting reforms installed by IOC President Thomas Bach and use mostly existing venues \u2014 which has meant scattering the Games all over northern Italy.",
      "Alpine skiing will be divided between Cortina (for the women\u2019s events) and Bormio (for the men) \u2014 which are separated by a 5 \u00bd-hour drive. Livigno will host freestyle skiing and snowboarding, biathlon will be in Anterselva, Nordic events will be in Val di Fiemme and ice sports in Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very complicated due to the big distances and also because of all the different representatives in each region,\u201d Varnier said. \u201cWe have great relationships with everyone but everybody has their own way and style of doing things, so we need to adapt to them. That\u2019s the spirit of these Games: We adapt to the different territories and not vice versa.\u201d",
      "One reason that the organizing committee is adapting to each and every venue is that most of these places have a long history of hosting World Cup races and world championships.",
      "For example, Bormio hosted the Alpine skiing worlds in 1985 and 2005; Cortina hosted the skiing worlds in 2021 and has been the site of more than 100 World Cup ski races; Anterselva has hosted six biathlon worlds dating back to 1975; Val di Fiemme has hosted three Nordic worlds.",
      "Still, none of that does any good for an athlete like Ester Ledecka, the Czech wonder who claimed golds in both Alpine skiing and snowboarding at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. In 2026, two of Ledecka\u2019s races will be held on the same day in resorts hours apart \u2014 meaning she\u2019ll likely have to choose one over the other.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs are pursuing history and a few of Taylor Swift\u2019s records.",
      "Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles stand in their way.",
      "The Chiefs (17-2) will try to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls when they face the Eagles (17-3) on Sunday in the Superdome.",
      "It\u2019s a rematch from two years ago when Hurts nearly led the Eagles to a championship only to watch Mahomes snatch it away by rallying Kansas City to a 38-35 win on Harrison Butker\u2019s 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left.",
      "Mahomes lifted the Chiefs to an overtime win against San Francisco in another Super Bowl rematch last year. Now, they\u2019re poised for a three-peat, a word coach Andy Reid doesn\u2019t use much.",
      "\"I think the only time I\u2019ve heard him say it is to the media whenever y\u2019all ask him about it,\" Mahomes said. \"He\u2019s very locked in on just, \u2018How can we be great with our cadence today at practice?\u2019 so that\u2019s just the stuff that Coach Reid focuses on.\"",
      "Reid won more games than any coach in franchise history during his 14 seasons in Philadelphia but couldn\u2019t win the big one, going 1-4 in NFC championship games and losing a Super Bowl to the Patriots. He went right to Kansas City after the Eagles fired him following the 2012 season and has built a dynasty thanks to Mahomes, Kelce, Chris Jones and others.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have time to think about all that,\u201d Reid said of the three-peat. \u201cYou\u2019re focused in on the job at hand here and that\u2019s playing against a great Eagles team.\u201d",
      "Jones, the three-time All-Pro defensive tackle, echoed his coach\u2019s viewpoint.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about no three-peat,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We understand that. We understand there\u2019s one more game until the offseason and we can do whatever we want to do. Our main focus is making sure we\u2019re prepared for the Eagles.\u201d",
      "No matter what the Chiefs say, everyone else is talking about it. No team has done it in the Super Bowl era, though the Green Bay Packers won an NFL championship in 1965 and followed by winning the first two Super Bowls. Kelce even started all the three-peat talk on stage last year when he said the team\u2019s goal was to win three.",
      "\u201cThis is gonna be our biggest test yet,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThey got a lot of great players but the biggest thing is they play great together. You could see their communication. You could see the accountability they have, especially in the secondary. It\u2019s not gonna make my job any easier.\u201d",
      "These Eagles are different from the group that fell just short against Kansas City in Arizona two years ago.",
      "They have the NFL\u2019s most dynamic player in the backfield. Barkley rushed for 2,447 yards with seven touchdowns of 60-plus yards in the regular season and playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe goal has always been to win it, not just to get here,\u201d Barkley said.",
      "Losing to the Chiefs two years ago only motivated Hurts even more. He\u2019s determined to hoist a Lombardi trophy and even had a photo of him walking off the field with Kansas City\u2019s red and yellow confetti falling around him as the background on his phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s had a great driving force,\u201d Hurts said of that loss. \u201cIt lit a flame, lit a fire in me, and to have this opportunity again is exactly what you work for.\u201d",
      "Hurts, Barkley, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and a dominant offensive line present a major challenge for Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.",
      "The Eagles also have the league\u2019s No. 1-ranked defense, featuring eight new starters from 2022 and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.",
      "All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun and rookie cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean plus the emergence of defensive tackle Jalen Carter and edge rusher Nolan Smith has transformed a defensive unit that fell apart last season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have Steve Spagnuolo, but I tell you that Vic is one of those guys,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s just one of those really creative defensive minds that survived a long time in this league. He\u2019s been time-tested, and, he has the trust of his players.\u201d",
      "If the Chiefs win, Reid and Mahomes will be one step closer to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. They\u2019re halfway to the six Belichick and Brady won together in New England and Mahomes is still four away from Brady\u2019s seven rings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the greatest Patrick Mahomes that I can be. That\u2019s obviously a goal of anyone\u2019s \u2014 to be the greatest at their profession \u2014 but in order to do that, you have to be the greatest that you can be every single day,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "\u201cWhenever I\u2019m done with football, if I leave everything out there \u2014 the way that I feel like I have so far \u2014 as far as effort and mentality, I\u2019ll be happy with the results.\u201d",
      "A win for Kansas City also would give Kelce his fourth ring, the same number of Grammy Awards his pop star girlfriend has won for best album. Overall, Kelce has 18 playoff wins and Swift has 14 Grammys.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s up there being the superstar that she is and never taking no for an answer and always working her tail off. I better match that energy for sure,\u201d Kelce said.",

      "The two main clusters of the Games are Milan \u2014 the beating heart of Italy's industrial north \u2014 and Cortina d'Ampezzo, a posh winter resort in the Dolomites mountain range, about 280 kilometres (170 miles) northeast of Milan.",

The arena has been the long-time home of the city\u2019s two famous soccer teams \u2014 AC Milan and Inter Milan \u2014 and has also hosted other sporting events as well as concerts.2. Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena. A year ago, the 16,000-seat arena that\u2019s supposed to welcome back NHL players to the Olympics was still a giant construction pit. But work has been carried out rapidly and the skeleton of the facility now rises 35 meters (115 feet) above street level, serving as a majestic sight to those arriving into the southeastern periphery of Milan. After the Olympics, the multipurpose facility being built by private investors is likely to become the next destination of the ATP Finals. The tennis tournament's contract with Turin expires this year.3. Ice Park. While all the ice hockey finals will be held in the Santagiulia Arena, some matches will take place in the Fiera Milano exhibition venue, which will also host the speed skating. The so-called Ice Park will occupy four pavilions of the huge exhibition center and comprise the Speed Skating Stadium and the Rho Ice Hockey Arena. The trade fair complex, which opened in 2005 in the northwest of Milan, will use temporary structures for the Games.4. Ice Skating Arena. Short-track speed skating and figure skating events will take place in the Forum di Milano, a multipurpose facility that is mainly used for basketball, ice hockey and tennis as well as live concerts. The 12,500-capacity venue in the southwestern outskirts of Milan was opened in 1990 and renovated in 2017, the year before it hosted the figure skating world championships.",

      "The U.S. Open is the first major to publish a pathway for players from Saudi-funded LIV Golf",
      "The U.S. Open became the first major to publish a direct pathway for LIV Golf players, on Wednesday announcing a new exemption category that awards one spot to the leading player from among the top three at LIV\u2019s halfway point this year.",
      "The next exemption category will include one spot this year from the May 19 standings in LIV. Starting with the 2026 U.S. Open, the USGA will take the leading player in the final 2025 individual standings, along with the leading player from the May 18, 2026, list.",
      "In each case, the exemption goes to the leading player not already exempt, and the player must be among the top three in the standings.",
      "The other majors have not turned away players from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League. The Masters has invited Joaquin Niemann each of the last two years, though Augusta National based that on his international play.",
      "The PGA Championship has invited LIV players based on their world ranking, and for 2024 at Valhalla it invited Talor Gooch, who had won three times on LIV the previous year. But the PGA of America does not have specific criteria, lumping LIV players and others into \u201cspecial invitations.\u201d Niemann and Sergio Garcia already have received PGA invitations this year.",
      "For this year\u2019s U.S. Open, an exemption from qualifying will be given \u201cthe top player who is not otherwise exempt and in the top three\" of the LIV individual standings as of May 19.",
      "That could mean no one gets that exemption if the leading three are already eligible. Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Richard Bland, Phil Mickelson and Cameron Smith are LIV players currently exempt.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the USGA has formally created a new exemption for LIV Golf players to compete in the U.S. Open and appreciate Mike Whan\u2019s leadership and commitment to growing the game of golf,\" said Scott O'Neil, the new CEO of LIV Golf.",
      "\u201cEvery golf fan in the world longs to see the greatest players in the world competing on golf\u2019s biggest stages at the majors,\u201d O'Neil said. \"LIV Golf is committed to working hand in hand with golf\u2019s governing bodies to elevate the sport in all corners of the world.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Open is June 12-15 at Oakmont Country Club in the Pittsburgh suburbs.",
      "\u201cThe USGA continues to evaluate the pathways that exist to ensure those playing their best have the opportunity to compete in our national championship,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the USGA chief championships officer.",
      "\u201cConsistent with our historical approach, we continuously evaluate talent levels on professional tours and in amateur events, which has led us to add a new exemption category.\u201d",
      "In addition to the new category, the USGA will offer exemptions from the first stage of 18-hole qualifying starting next year to the top 10 players on the LIV points list on April 7, 2026. Five LIV events will have been played by then.",
      "LIV begins its fourth season on Thursday under the lights at Riyadh Golf Club in Saudi Arabia, equipped with its first network deal with Fox Sports. It also has events scheduled for Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Miami and South Korea before the U.S. Open exemption deadline.",
      "Players from the breakaway league always have been able to go through qualifying \u2014 four LIV players made it through U.S. Open qualifying last year. But having a set target could be seen as a boost, particularly to young players who have no status on established tours.",
      "Among the young players who joined LIV Golf this year are Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, Frederik Kjettrup of Denmark, Luis Masaveu of Spain and Yubin Jang of South Korea.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Vic Fangio's coaching career started in the 1970s as a high school assistant in Pennsylvania and has taken him across the country in various stops as he grew into one of the most innovative defensive coaches in the game.",
      "Now at age 66, Fangio is at the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he started his NFL coaching career, as defensive coordinator with the Philadelphia Eagles team he grew up supporting with a chance to fill one of the few remaining gaps on a stellar career.",
      "\u201cI grew up a Philadelphia sports fan,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cPhillies, Eagles, Sixers, started my pro career in Philadelphia with the USFL. And now I\u2019ll probably end it here one of these years. It\u2019s kind of come full circle. ... I kind of fit there.\u201d",
      "Fangio has incorporated eight new starters into a defense that ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2023 and turned it into one of the league's best as the Eagles led the NFL in advanced efficiency metrics and allowed the second-fewest points in the league.",
      "He is a major reason why the Eagles are in the Super Bowl, giving Fangio the success he couldn't achieve in a failed head coaching stint in Denver and a chance to win his first Super Bowl in 38 seasons in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI still really like to do it. I think I\u2019m still halfway decent at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. If you hang around long enough the tide will turn.\u201d",
      "Fangio began his NFL career coaching one of the top linebacking groups ever for New Orleans' \u201cDome Patrol\u201d teams in 1986 and got his first chance as defensive coordinator for expansion Carolina in 1995.",
      "He has spent nearly all of his time since in the NFL, with a one-year break to go to Stanford, and his defensive style that disguises coverages and tries to keep two safeties as deep as possible to limit big plays has been mimicked throughout the league.",
      "His only previous trip to the Super Bowl came in the 2012 season with San Francisco, when he lost to Baltimore here at the Superdome.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about coaches, sometimes you're like \u2018He\u2019s been a good coach for years.\u2019 He\u2019s very good coach for decades, which is impressive,\u201d Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had an unbelievable career and done so many good things and just so grateful that he\u2019s on the staff. He has the standard of how it\u2019s supposed to look and holds the guys to that standard. He\u2019s not afraid to tell you what he thinks if you don\u2019t meet the standard and praise you if you do meet the standards.\u201d",
      "Fangio has been integral in the defensive rebuild in Philadelphia. He saw enough in free agent Zack Baun to turn him from a special teams player who got limited time on defense as an outside rusher in New Orleans into an All-Pro inside linebacker and finalist for AP Defensive Player of the Year in Philadelphia.",
      "He also helped incorporate two rookie starters in the secondary in Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, which played a big part in the turnaround.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like a father figure,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hold you accountable. He\u2019s serious. But he\u2019s got jokes too. He\u2019s funny as well.\"",
      "But Fangio will face his toughest test on Sunday when the Eagles face Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.",
      "While much has been made out of Fangio's 0-8 record against Mahomes as a head coach in Denver and play-caller in Miami, he never had a defense as talented as this one when he faced him.",
      "The record diminishes what Fangio did on defense as his teams scored just 11.9 points per game in those games. Fangio's defenses allowed only 21.6 points per game to the Kansas City offense \u2014 the Chiefs got six additional TDs on defense and special teams \u2014 and Mahomes threw only 10 TD passes in the eight games and had a lower passer rating (95.9) and yards per attempt (7.3) than his career average.",
      "\u201cEvery time I've played Coach Fangio, there's been different changeups and different things he's thrown at us,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThat's what makes him so great. He won\u2019t do what he did the last time.\u201d",
      "Mahomes called games against Fangio a \"chess match\" and Fangio stressed the importance of changing up schemes because of Mahomes' \u201celite\u201d ability to understand what a defense is doing both before the snap and after.",
      "\u201cThere is no secret. This is his seventh year as a starter. No one has gotten the formula to beat him,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cHe\u2019s won the chess match against me, the final score. We\u2019ll see if there's something we can come up with.\u201d",

      "Tom Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl 59 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles",
      "Even though the scoreboard won\u2019t measure Tom Brady\u2019s performance in the Fox Sports booth during Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, he is trying to take the same approach that he did in his previous 10 appearances in the big game as a player.",
      "Brady addressed questions about his move to broadcasting as well as other issues on Wednesday during a conference call previewing Sunday\u2019s matchup in New Orleans between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "It was the first time Brady was made available for interviews. He has frequently appeared during the season on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no scoreboard for us. Did we feel we approached the game the right way, and were we prepared? Ultimately, it comes down to two things: Was I confident in what I said, and did I enjoy myself? I think if those are yes, then we did a good job,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited for what\u2019s ahead.\u201d",
      "Brady has received as much scrutiny as an analyst as he did during his 23 seasons quarterbacking the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he won seven Super Bowls.",
      "While the general consensus is that his first year in the booth has not been as good as Tony Romo\u2019s with CBS in 2017, Brady hasn\u2019t struggled as other former players and coaches who have attempted broadcasting.",
      "Kevin Burkhardt, who is calling his second Super Bowl, said he has noticed Brady\u2019s comfort level improve as the season progresses.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a reason that not everybody dives into this end of the pool because it\u2019s hard to be on TV for 3 1/2 hours every week and not have an edit button and go back and hit the delete button,\u201d Burkhardt said.",
      "\"I think the goal the whole way along was for us as a team to grow and get better as the year goes on. I think with anybody new, and I\u2019ve worked with enough new partners over the years, it takes time to build chemistry, whether they\u2019re a TV veteran or not, and I think with this, it\u2019s no different. It just takes time on task. So I\u2019m just proud of where we are.\"",
      "Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for Tampa Bay. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "Burkhardt and Brady had plenty of practice games during the season, but those took place mostly on the Fox Sports lot in Los Angeles and not viewed by millions. Brady, though, knew that the learning curve was going to be steep, but he was ready for the challenge.",
      "\u201cTo use your voice and vision for a live television audience, there\u2019s a lot of adrenaline in that, but it was very different from when I played. I would probably see all these things, I didn\u2019t have to verbalize them,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI knew subconsciously what to do, and my body just took over because that\u2019s how I trained it. When you embrace the uncertainty, you work as hard as you can to prepare yourself, knowing that you\u2019re going to wish you had done some things over. I\u2019ve enjoyed the learning curve.",
      "\u201cI love the ability to take the viewer inside of just the way that I see things. In some ways, it\u2019s very simple. In some ways, it\u2019s very complicated. I feel as a crew, we\u2019re all hitting our stride. We know each other better every week. Hopefully, this is our best game yet.\u201d",
      "Brady noted that along with feedback he has received from Fox Sports, Romo, NBC\u2019s Cris Collinsworth and Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Al Michaels have reached out.",
      "Along with Brady\u2019s approach to games as an analyst, there have also been questions about his dual roles in calling games and having a 5% stake as a limited owner in the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "The NFL put rules in place not allowing Brady to participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager said in an interview with The Associated Press last month that any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling games and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "Brady will be allowed this week to attend production meetings with Chiefs and Eagles players and coaches. He will not be able to view practices.",
      "Brady said that not being allowed in production meetings this season has not affected his research when preparing for games, even though there are other benefits he misses.",
      "\u201cI think the best part (of production meetings) is there are just genuine relationships that get built up over time, and it\u2019s a shared experience with people on your own crew sitting on calls and talking,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFrom a research standpoint, I listen to press conferences all week. To me, there\u2019s no difference in a media member asking a question on a Wednesday, Thursday or Friday press conference that would be any different from any of the questions I would ask or the crew would ask.\u201d",
      "Brady did not directly say how much of a role he took in the Raiders hirings of head coach Pete Carroll, general manager John Spytek, and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Owner Mark Davis recently said that Brady had helped lead a committee that brought Carroll and Spytek to the Raiders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m there to support the team, the leadership, and the overall vision for success,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThis approach as a broadcaster has been all-encompassing this year. And the reality is that Mark Davis is the owner of the Raiders and I play a supportive, complementary role to the vision that he sets. And that will happen in its own time and place.\u201d",
      "While Brady\u2019s Patriots fell short in their quest for three straight Super Bowls, he said he would be happy to see Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs be the first team in the Super Bowl era to accomplish that feat.",
      "It would also be the fourth championship for Mahomes, putting him closer to Brady and a title record that few thought could be reached when he retired.",
      "\u201cI love seeing other people achieve great things and for people to detract from anything Patrick is doing, I don\u2019t believe will ever detract from what I accomplished in my career,\u201d Brady said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is we all have our journeys. The comparisons are fun naturally for the media because it serves a different perspective and context that people can write and talk about. But as a competitor that I was, I never viewed it that way, and I still don\u2019t today, even in the role that I am now.\u201d",

      "It's a big deal. It's also a big reminder of what's next.",
      "For the Americans, the goal is to win medals this weekend \u2014 and they have realistic chances to do so in no fewer than three events. But it's also clear that eyes and minds are starting to drift toward February 2026, when the next Olympic sliding races are held in either Italy (if a track gets built) or on USA Luge's home track in Lake Placid, New York.",
      "\u201cThe Olympics is my focus,\" three-time women's singles Olympic slider Summer Britcher said. \u201cIt has been my focus for a long time. But I don\u2019t view it as a distraction from other races like world championships or World Cups. I view it as in collaboration with them. Every World Cup and world championships is an opportunity to see how things are trending, to work on our equipment, to work on racing well. And it\u2019s all building towards the Olympics.\u201d",
      "As always, Germany is the nation to catch \u2014 44 medals so far in World Cup races this season are the most of any nation, six more than an Austrian team that seems to be peaking at exactly the right time in the Olympic cycle. Latvia has 11 medals so far this season and the U.S. is fourth with nine.",
      "The majority of the American medals this season have been claimed by the women's doubles team of Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby \u2014 winners of four medals in doubles races and part of more medal performances in relays. At this rate, they seem like locks to make their Olympic debuts next winter.",
      "On a team filled with Olympic veterans and proven sliders \u2014 Britcher and Emily Sweeney have been among the best in the women's singles world for years, Tucker West has one of the fastest men's starts on the circuit \u2014 Forgan and Kirkby are quickly proving themselves. They're young and exuberant, which is clear from the glitter adorning their faces on race days and just how excited they get on the medal stand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important things to make sure we\u2019re still having fun,\" Forgan said. \u201cObviously, this season has been our best season so far results-wise. We\u2019ve kind of been having to remind ourselves, when it\u2019s getting kind of tough and it\u2019s getting kind of serious and we\u2019re really pushing, that we are having fun and we love what we do. And I think that really carries us through a lot of the difficulties that come with being on the road so much and how intense the competition can get.\u201d",
      "The world championship mixed doubles and mixed singles races were set for Thursday, with three competitions \u2014 men\u2019s doubles, women\u2019s doubles and women\u2019s singles \u2014 on Friday. The championships close on Saturday with men\u2019s singles and the team relay.",
      "The relay is fast becoming a favorite for the U.S. squad, since it brings men's singles, women's singles, women's doubles and men's doubles sleds together in the same event.",
      "\u201cFrom Day 1, Team USA is drilled into you and we are Team USA at our core,\" Sweeney said. \"And the way that we come together during relays is something that\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",

    "summary": "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "Mitsotakis visited Santorini a day after the government declared a state of emergency to allow authorities to have faster access to state resources. Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents, tourists and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry. Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead to a more powerful earthquake.",

      "Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China under a new partnership with the Shanghai government",
      "TOKYO -- Toyota is developing and making electric vehicles and EV batteries in China, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, under a new partnership with the Shanghai government.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",
      "Toyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
      "\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.",

      "Scientists say they\u2019ve cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists say they've cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg.",
      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",
      "To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering.",
      "This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time.",
      "\u201cThis is a slower process to get a better outcome,\u201d said Slavin, who had no role in the study.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:51:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones under a new law restricting the use of devices in schools",
    "story": [
      "Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones under a new law restricting the use of devices in schools",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones as a new law restricting their use in schools took effect.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a bill in January limiting smartphone access at schools, in line with a trend seen in the U.S. and Europe. It applies to public and private schools, and applies to classrooms and the halls.",
      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, which is among one of the world\u2019s highest rates of use.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by the U.N.'s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized used a U.S. Senate hearing last year to apologize to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",
      "Mariana Waetge, a 13-year-old student at Porto Seguro, has owned a smartphone for five years. She uses it to communicate with friends and family and to find entertainment on social media, especially Instagram. Being forced to stay away from her phone made her find new ways to interact with friends, improved her focus and even strengthened her relationship with her family.",
      "The restriction also helped \"include people who didn\u2019t have many friends and would use their phones to hide from making new friends or to avoid being out there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that option anymore. These people end up playing board games or reading books.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The move, which was outlined in an email sent to Google employees on Wednesday, came in the wake of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that was aimed in part at pressuring government contractors to scrap their DEI initiatives.",
      "Like several other major tech companies, Google sells some of its technology and services to the federal government, including its rapidly growing cloud division that\u2019s a key piece of its push into artificial technology.",
      "Google's parent company, Alphabet, also signaled the shift in its annual 10-K report it filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, Google removed a line included in previous annual reports saying that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d",
      "Google generates most of Alphabet's annual revenue of $350 billion and accounts for almost all of its worldwide workforce of 183,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we\u2019ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,\" Google said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We\u2019ve updated our 10-K language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d",
      "The change in language also comes slightly more than two weeks after Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other prominent technology executives \u2014 including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 stood behind Trump during his inauguration.",
      "Meta jettisoned its DEI program last month, shortly before the inauguration, while Amazon halted some of its DEI programs in December following Trump's election.",
      "Many companies outside of the technology industry also have backed away from DEI. Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald's, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe's and John Deere.",
      "Trump's recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \u201cillegal\u201d DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\u2019s damages.",
      "The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \u201cIllegal discrimination or preference.\u201d",
      "The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \u201cillegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to \u201cterminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \u201cto , combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\u201d",
      "In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.",
      "Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.",
      "Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company's largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025. Google has made some headway since then, but the makeup of its leadership has not changed dramatically.",
      "The representation of Black people in the company's leadership ranks rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 5.1% last year, according to Google's annual diversity report. For Hispanic people, the change was 3.7% to 4.3%. The share of women in leadership roles, meanwhile, increased from 26.7% in 2020 to 32.8% in 2024, according to the company's report.",
      "The numbers aren't much different in Google's overall workforce, with Black employees comprising just 5.7% and Latino employees 7.5%. Two-thirds of Google's worldwide workforce is made up of men, according to the diversity report.",

      "Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life but they\u2019re privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you\u2019ve been",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life, but they're privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you've been \u2014 if you let them.",
      "When you use a map app to find the new restaurant your friend recommended, or your phone's browser to check the price of something you saw while window shopping, you could be unwittingly allowing your phone to track your location and share that information with others.",
      "Phones use various signals to find your location, including cell tower pings, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth and GPS.",
      "Sometimes your phone needs to know your location to provide a useful service, like telling the Uber driver where to pick you up. But in other cases, there\u2019s little justification for tracking your whereabouts, which then can be exploited by apps, ad services or even hackers.",
      "\u201cFrom fitness tracking to navigation, every location ping potentially reveals details about our routines and movements \u2013 which could be risky in the wrong hands,\" said Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security. \u201cUsers should turn on location tracking only when necessary, such as during navigation, emergencies or sharing updates with trusted contacts, and disable it immediately afterward.\"",
      "Experts warn location data could be used to track people who visit abortion clinics. Or \"a disgruntled ex could use location sharing to stalk someone, or a current, abusive partner could force you into location sharing as a means of control,\u201d said David Ruiz, senior privacy advocate at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes.",
      "Here are some tips to make sure location tracking is kept to a minimum:",
      "Head to your phone's control panel to check permissions.",
      "iPhone users can go to the Privacy & Security tab, and then to Location Services to check settings for individual apps. It's not a good idea to let apps always use your location in the background, according to cybersecurity experts. Instead, get the app to either ask first before using your location, use it only while you've got the app open, or even never let it use your location.",
      "While you're in Location Services, you might notice little arrows that indicate which apps have used your location. Purple means recently, while grey indicates the past 24 hours.",
      "It's a little different for Android phones because there are so many different versions by various device manufacturers. In general, go to settings, and then tap the Location icon, which lets you turn it on or off for all apps.",
      "To tweak settings for individual apps, tap App location permissions, where you'll get choices similar to those in iOS.",
      "Apple has other tools to cut down on third-party tracking that might include location information. On the iPhone's Privacy & Security setting, under the Tracking tab, there's a toggle to Allow Apps to Request to Track. With this switched off, any new app requests will be automatically denied and they will also be stopped from accessing your phone's ad identifier.",
      "Privacy experts recommend blocking your Google or Apple device\u2019s in-house ad identifier, which enables third-party tracking on most devices for better ad targeting.",
      "On iPhones, go to the Privacy setting then scroll down to Apple Advertising, and then switch off Personalized Ads. On newer Android phones, go to the Privacy setting, then to Ads, where you can tap Delete Advertising ID.",
      "Whether you use Android or iOS, they both have settings to allow precisely pinpointing your location by combining wireless signals with data from onboard sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer. This helps to estimate the phone's position if, for example, you're inside a building blocking a GPS signal.",
      "One reason to use this function is to show someone you're meeting exactly where you are. Google says its signals are randomized so they can\u2019t be associated with a specific person or account. In any case, you might not want every app to know this, so you can tell your phone to only share its general location.",
      "On Android phones, turn off the Location Accuracy setting for all apps. On iPhones, switch it on or off for individual apps.",
      "Along with app permissions for your device, it's also a good idea to check your Google account. Google was forced to be more transparent about its location tracking practices after a 2018 Associated Press story that found the company continued to track people\u2019s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called \u201clocation history.\u201d",
      "Go to myaccount.google.com and then to the Data & Privacy section, where you'll find the Location History controls. Under recent changes, the history will be deleted after three months, though you can change that default setting.",
      "Popular smartphone web browsers like Safari or Chrome could give away your location, so try using one that that doesn't store information about you, like DuckDuckGo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia.",
      "If a privacy-focused browser needs to access your location through your IP address, they will ask first. It will also let you easily delete your cookies and other web browsing data.",
      "Phones or tablets can also be tracked with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device features for recovering lost devices. You can turn this feature off if you think someone has gained access to your Apple or Google account.",
      "Some cybersecurity websites recommend using airplane mode, but it doesn\u2019t always shut off all signals so you shouldn't rely on it.",
      "A signal-blocking Faraday pouch would be a better bet, but be sure to test it to make sure it's actually jamming all signals. And, keep in mind, you'll need to take the device out of the bag to use it.",
      "There are so many possible ways for smartphones \u2014 and other devices like smartwatches \u2014 to track our location that it's hard to provide an exhaustive checklist.",
      "Our default relationship with apps, companies, and platforms is for them to track us, \"which absolutely makes it harder for us to scrutinize all the channels through which our data is being sent,\" said Ruiz.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is that, to shut everything down, we have to go into our device settings and check each app, line by line, and make individual decisions for how those apps collect our location data,\" said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or turn off all location data entirely,\" which could result in inconveniences like having to manually enter your address on ride-hailing apps, or not getting live directions from mapping apps, he said.",

      "But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates \u201can unusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates, it said.",
      "Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.",
      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.",
      "\u201cWe think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.\u201d",
      "Jassy added during the call that Amazon, like many others, was \u201cimpressed\u201d by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.",
      "Amazon's quarterly report comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.",
      "Trump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.",
      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China."

      "LONDON -- Scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence and human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago.",
      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",
      "AI, as it stands, has its limits. Little of the text has been deciphered so far. One of the few words that has been made out is the ancient Greek for \u201cdisgust.\u201d",
      "Scholars are being encouraged to join in the effort to complete the text.",
      "\u201cWe are still at the beginning of a long process,\u201d Peter Toth, the Cornelia Starks Curator of Greek Collections at the Bodleian, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe need better images, and they are very positive and very, very confident that they can still improve the image quality and the legibility of the text.\u201d",
      "Toth also laid out his hope that the technology can be made available locally so that the other two fragile scrolls won't have to be transported to Diamond\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cMaybe there will be something which can be moved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then don\u2019t forget that there is like 1000 more scrolls in Naples.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers in the House are proposing to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from U.S. government devices",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan duo in the the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.",
      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill., on Thursday introduced the \u201cNo DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,\" which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.\"",
      "The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.",
      "The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.",
      "Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.",
      "In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.",
      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThis commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers\u2019 phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans\u2019 data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.\u201d",
      "The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.",
      "Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would bar the import of export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns."

      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",
      "Social science researchers and other federal data users on Monday described feeling like a five-alarm fire was triggered when they discovered late last week that vital federal datasets were inaccessible.",
      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",

      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island.",
      "Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.",
      "Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks.",
      "Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network.",
      "Michibiki\u2019s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones.",
      "Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 in order to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, noting the successful launch in a statement later Sunday, promised that his government will make further effort to \u201cmaximize\u201d the use of the navigation satellite system so that more people can smoothly access positioning data.",
      "Sunday's launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",
      "Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series \u2014 the larger H3 with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market."

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Elon Musk's lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire's request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "Musk is not the only one challenging OpenAI's for-profit transition. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has asked California's attorney general to block it, and the office of Delaware's attorney general has said it is reviewing the conversion.",

It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",
      "The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.",
      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.",
      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "In addition to the humanitarian work that has halted, scores of career USAID workers living abroad are also seeing their lives turned upside down. Several officials were very emotional describing their current situations and uncertainty.",
      "All USAID humanitarian work around the world has effectively stopped, these current and former officials said, despite the State Department saying there are waivers for lifesaving programs.",
      "\"Right now, there is no USAID humanitarian assistance happening,\" a current USAID official in the humanitarian division said. \"There are waivers put in place by Secretary Rubio for emergency food assistance and a number of other sectors, but they are a fraud and a sham and intended to give the illusion of continuity, which is untrue.\"",
      "The official also slammed the waiver as unclear and largely unactionable because staff has been furloughed, as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency seized control of the agency.",
      "\"There is no staff left anymore to actually process waiver requests or to move money or to make awards or to do anything,\" that official added. \"We've ceased to exist.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pushed back on nongovernmental organizations saying aid programs remained paused despite the waiver.",
      "\"I issued a blanket waiver that said if this is lifesaving programs, OK -- if it's providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent, you're not included in the freeze,\" he said. \"I don't know how much more clear we can be than that.",
      "\"And I would say if some organization is receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver, then I have real questions about the competence of that organization, or I wonder whether they're deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point,\" Rubio added.",
      "But the above USAID official pushed back, saying those sectors are \"actually unable to access their lines of credit here in Washington, D.C., for money already obligated to, already contractually put forward by the U.S. government.\"",
      "\"And this is meaning [a] lack of provision of assistance,\" the official continued. \"This is meaning staff layoffs, meaning absolute confusion and mayhem. Some may have some money to keep going for a little bit, but not for long.\"",
      "Another former official who spoke with numerous USAID humanitarian partner organizations said, \"Not one has received any funding since the stop-work order to continue work, even if theoretically that work is allowed to continue.\"",

We have a nursery painted with a crib ready for our baby that has taken us three years of fertility treatments to conceive,\" the official based in Asia said, her voice cracking with emotion. \"Instead of nesting and planning for their arrival, we are unsure if Secretary Rubio and President Trump are going to abandon us overseas or abandon us when we land on American soil. We have been told there is no money to assist USAID families that are awaiting the arrival of our infants with resettlement in the U.S.\"",

      "\"We worked across administrations with programs changing, growing, shrinking, and it's a circumstance right now where we literally have focused our life on this USAID mission, and we do not have a home to go back to, which is quite typical of Foreign Service families, and we don't know how we're supposed to pick up and just leave,\" the official added.",
      "\"How do you leave when you have not just family, not just school-age kids -- you have pets, you have things, you don't have a home to go back to, and you have a mission that you believe in and that you've supported for decades?\" the official said. \"And it's just the rug pulled under you.\"",

      "\"The government continues to make hyperbolic statements in court regarding the number of accusers, and the government's misguided efforts to solicit witnesses -- to prop up a baseless and publicity-driven case -- have yielded no credible evidence of any crime. Oren looks forward to further establishing his innocence.\"",
      "Prosecutors announced plans to file additional charges, stating that more than 60 women alleged they were raped by at least one of the brothers. The three siblings have been accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them.",
      "\"We do intend to bring a superseding indictment in this case,\" prosecutor Elizabeth Espinosa said. \"I think we will need another month or two.\"",
      "Espinosa said that investigators gathered a \"substantial\" amount of evidence, including accounts from alleged victims, as well as data from iCloud, Instagram, Facebook, dating apps, cell phones, laptop computers and electronic storage devices.",
      "In a January court hearing, when the brothers were still in Florida, prosecutor Andrew Jones said FBI agents found multiple hard drives in a closet of Tal's apartment during a search.",
      "They allegedly contained \"a large quantity of sexually explicit videos and photos\" showing the brothers with drunk, naked women who were unaware they were being recorded. According to prosecutors, some of the women tried to hide or flee from the camera when they realized they were being filmed.",

      "\"In my view, having a sex with a woman who is incapacitated is likely rape,\" Caproni said.",
      "On Friday, Caproni scheduled the trial for Jan. 5, 2026, anticipating it will last at least a month.\u00a0Defense attorneys have until early May to file a motion to dismiss. The next in-person court hearing is scheduled for mid-July.",
      "All three brothers face 15 years to life in prison if convicted of the federal charges. Oren and Tal were prominent New York and Miami real estate agents, working with wealthy and celebrity clients."

    "summary": "President Trump's flurry of executive actions and orders spark a critical question: Does he have the power he claims to have?",
    "story": [
      "He says the Constitution allows his unprecedented executive branch purge.",
      "As President Donald Trump works at a breakneck speed to implement his second-term agenda , including wholesale firings and sweeping policy changes, he and his advisers assert his power over the executive branch is complete and can't be questioned.",
      "Still, his flurry of executive actions and orders spark a critical question: Does he have the power he claims to have?",
      "Multiple court challenges are underway trying to stop his attempts to end birthright citizenship and temporarily freeze federal loans and grants.",
      "More legal pushback will unfold amid Trump's unprecedented purge of the executive workforce and reshaping of what Congress set up as independent agencies, the dismantling of which is largely being carried out by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Trump quickly fired 17 independent watchdogs and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Longtime Democratic Federal Election Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said Trump sent a letter removing her from the commission. His administration has directed all federal DEI staff be put on leave. The Justice Department fired more than a dozen of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases. Millions of employees were offered buyouts, with tens of thousands of people accepting them.",
      "His administration has touted the moves as long-overdue cutting of waste in favor of a merit-based system. His critics slam them as a radical restructuring of the federal government aimed at consolidating presidential power -- and placing loyalty to Trump over regulatory agency expertise designed to be insulated from political influence.",
      "The 'unitary executive theory'",
      "Driving Trump's strategy is a legal framework championed by conservatives, perhaps most notably by Trump's newly-confirmed director of White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025. (Democrats held an all-night protest of Vought's nomination on the Senate floor Wednesday into Thursday, though his nomination was later approved by Republicans.)",
      "The so-called \"unitary executive theory\" has various iterations but centers on the idea that the Constitution gives the president sole control over the executive branch of government.",
      "Its advocates point to Article II, which reads in part: \"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\"",
      "\"I think that means he has the power to control subordinates throughout the executive branch, including in the independent agencies and how they exercise power. And as a corollary to that, he has the power to remove or fire subordinates in the executive branch,\" said Steven Calabresi, a Northwestern University law professor and former Reagan administration official who co-authored a book on the unitary executive theory.",
      "Trump in 2019 said: \"I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.\"",
      "Setting up Supreme Court test cases?",
      "Some of Trump's firings, especially those that seem to fly in the face of statutory protections for civil service workers from being removed without cause, are likely to result in lawsuits that put that theory in front of the courts.",
      "\"I think they are setting up test cases, and this Supreme Court is very likely to expand the theory and overrule other cases that are in tension with it,\" said David Driesen, a law professor at Syracuse University.",
      "In 2020, the Supreme Court found a provision from Congress limiting the president's authority to remove the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau violated the Constitution -- a departure from precedent. The Trump White House has pointed to that ruling as justification for some of its firings.",
      "Trump pushing limits on executive authority",
      "But some say Trump is leaning on the theory to go even further, blatantly trying to take over powers the Constitution gives to other branches of government, namely Congress, violating the separation of powers and the concept of checks and balances.",
      "\"This is where the debate is: at what point does the kind of power that Trump wants and the way he exercises his power cross over from a constitutional vision about presidential power to an a-constitutional vision,\" said Bob Bauer, a law professor at New York University and former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.",
      "\"The unitary executive theory has a history that isn't nearly, in my judgment, what is claimed for it and now put into effect by Trump and his allies,\" Bauer added.",
      "Trump has sought to sidestep Congress and take control of federal spending, trying to freeze money already appropriated by lawmakers. His OMB pick, Vought, told senators during his confirmation hearing that the Trump administration would seek to impound funds it believes are being misspent.",
      "Even bolder, Trump's pledging to dismantle entire agencies. Turmoil is roiling USAID as its being taken over by the State Department and its staff reduced from 14,000 people to fewer than 300 staff, sources said.

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:39:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Just hours before the deadline for federal employees to accept the Trump administration's deferred resignation offer, a judge has temporarily blocked the buyout offer.",
    "story": [
      "The ruling came just hours before the deadline for employees to take the offer.",
      "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration and DOGE head Elon Musk from implementing their \"Fork in the Road\" federal employee buyout offer until at least Monday afternoon.",
      "U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. set a Monday afternoon hearing to consider further blocking the so-called \"Fork in the Road\" offer.",
      "\"I enjoined the defendants from taking any action to implement the so-called 'Fork Directive' pending the completion of briefing and oral argument on the issues,\" said O'Toole. \"I believe that's as far as I want to go today.\"",
      "The judge described the brief hearing as a \"table setting session\" just to schedule arguments for Monday afternoon. He did not say anything about the merits of the dispute over the buyout.",
      "Lawyers for the Department of Justice said they would notify every federal employee who is subject to the buyout.",
      "More than two million federal employees had faced a midnight Thursday deadline to accept the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer as O'Toole considered an eleventh-hour request to block the buyout from moving forward.",
      "Four unions representing a combined 800,000 federal civil servants argued that the offer is unlawful, arbitrary, and would result in a \"dangerous one-two punch\" to the federal government.",
      "In a Thursday evening filing following the judge's ruling, lawyers for the Justice Department warned against any further delay of the buyout, telling the judge that extending the delay would have \"remarkably disruptive and inequitable repercussions.\"",
      "The DOJ attorneys argued that the buyout is an instrumental tool in Trump's plan to reform the federal workforce.",
      "\"Upon his reelection to office, President Trump immediately set to work to transform the federal workforce,\" the filing said. \"Animating these and other critical reforms is the recognition that the federal workforce must be streamlined to be more efficient and to better serve the American people.\"",
      "\"Extending the deadline for the acceptance of deferred resignation on its very last day will markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the Administration's efforts to reform the federal workforce,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The filing argued that the four unions who brought the case can't establish standing to bring the case or demonstrate that the Trump administration is breaking the law by implementing the buyout. If the court issues an injunction, they argued that any relief should be limited to the employees represented by the unions themselves, not the entire federal workforce.",
      "Judge O'Toole set the Thursday afternoon hearing to consider a request by four federal unions to issue a temporary restraining order that would suspend Thursday's deadline for the buyout and require the Office of Personnel Management to provide a legal basis for the unprecedented offer, which offered to continue to pay federal employees through Sept. 30, 2025, if they resigned by Thursday at 11:59 p.m.",
      "\"First, the government will lose expertise in the complex fields and programs that Congress has, by statute, directed the Executive to faithfully implement,\" the lawsuit said. \"And second, when vacant positions become politicized, as this Administration seeks to do, partisanship is elevated over ability and truth, to the detriment of agency missions and the American people.\"",
      "The judge's ruling's comes as at least 40,000 federal workers -- roughly 2% of the civilian federal workforce -- have already accepted the deferred resignation offer to leave the federal government since last week, ABC News has reported.",
      "The four unions -- including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- argue that the OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide a legal basis for the buyout offer and leaving open the possibility that the government might not follow through with the buyout once federal employees agree to resign.",
      "The lawsuit added that the buyout's promise of payments through September violates the law because the current appropriation for federal agencies expires in March. Moreover, the buyout is unfair because it was made alongside a threat of future layoffs, the lawsuit said.",
      "The buyout offer, part of Elon Musk's effort to trim the size of government through the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, was sent out under the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" -- the same language Musk used when he slashed jobs at Twitter after taking over that company in 2022.",
      "\"To leverage employees into accepting the offer and resigning, the Fork Directive threatens employees with eventual job loss in the event that they refuse to resign,\" the unions' lawsuit said.",
      "Overall, the lawsuit alleged that the OPM rushed the offer with a questionable legal basis, largely mimicking Elon Musk's management style following his takeover of Twitter.",
      "\"OPM's rapid adoption of Musk's private-sector program confirms that the agency took very little time to consider the suitability of applying an approach used with questionable success in a single for-profit entity to the entirety of the federal workforce,\" said the lawsuit.",

    "story": [
      "FBI agents had sought a temporary restraining order to block the list's release.",
      "The Justice Department and attorneys representing a group of FBI employees who sued over a list compiled of personnel who worked on cases stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol reached a temporary deal Friday to ensure the list won't be released publicly pending further legal proceedings.",
      "The agreement by the Justice Department states \"the government will not disseminate the list ... to the public, directly or indirectly, before the Court rules on Plaintiff's anticipated motions for a preliminary injunction.\"",
      "If DOJ leadership were to change their minds and release the list, they would need to provide two business days' notice to attorneys and the court, per the agreement.",
      "The anonymous group of FBI agents had sought a temporary restraining order to keep the FBI from releasing the names on a list the bureau collected as part of what the plaintiffs' lawsuit says is the agency's plan to engage in \"potential vigilante action\" to retaliate against government employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases or Donald Trump's classified documents case.",
      "After several hours of grueling back and forth during a hearing Thursday, the Justice Department's attorney, Jeremy Simon, was able to commit that the DOJ itself would not further disseminate the list pending further proceedings in the case -- but that answer did not satisfy either the judge or plaintiffs' attorneys because Simon said he could not ensure that other parties in the government would not be able to release the list in some form.",
      "Simon noted he had no reason to believe the list has been shared beyond DOJ leadership, and ultimately was able to relay from a superior that there's been no \"official\" dissemination of the list after it was handed over by the FBI.",
      "\"What does that mean?\" pressed U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, questioning whether the list could have been unofficially leaked outside of the department.",
      "Simon said he had no reason to believe it had been leaked but couldn't commit under oath that the list wouldn't be shared or released by a separate government entity outside of DOJ.",
      "\"You represent the government,\" Judge Cobb said. \"The White House wants this information. Does the government have present intent to publicly release names of FBI agents that worked on Jan. 6 cases?\"",
      "\"People who have the list don't have present intent,\" Simon replied.",
      "Simon further said he had difficulty getting approval from superiors about language they could agree upon to further bind the government from releasing the list, citing other major civil rulings that the department has faced in just the past several hours.",
      "The parties reached an out-of-court agreement on Friday that restricts the government from releasing the list pending further proceedings. The court set a preliminary injunction hearing over the list for March 27.",
      "Earlier Thursday, attorneys for the agents argued that the release of the list would have serious consequences.",
      "\"Our argument is that the threat to national security is so extreme that we cannot risk letting it happen first, and then trying to put it back together,\" said attorney for the agents Margaret Donovan in arguing for the temporary restraining order.",
      "\"I appreciate that, and I'm sympathetic to that argument,\" Judge Cobb said. \"A fear of something happening is not sufficient, even if -- you know -- the fear is a serious one.\"",
      "Lawyers representing the plaintiffs warned that the Trump Administration and DOGE head Elon Musk have demonstrated a willingness to publicly name officials they've accused of wrongdoing, such as the 51 former intelligence officials who wrote a letter about the Hunter Biden laptop and were later stripped of their security clearances in a Day-1 executive order by President Donald Trump.",
      "\"We have seen Elon Musk, working for the so-called DOGE agency, release names of individuals in public service. We have seen Jan. 6 pardonees very active on social media around the time of the survey, anticipating that the names would be released,\" Donovan said. \"We have a good faith reason to believe that those names may get out.\"",
      "In a court filing submitted Thursday morning, the Justice Department urged the judge hearing the case to reject the plaintiffs' request to impose a restraining order blocking any public release of the list.",
      "DOJ attorneys argued in the filing that the motion for the restraining order is based largely on speculation and that the FBI agents have failed to show they face any imminent threats in connection with the list.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in 2023 to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, and, separately, to charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The classified documents case was dismissed last year by a federal judge, and both cases were subsequently dropped following Trump's reelection in November due to a longstanding DOJ policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats are pushing back against Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency as it turns its attention to the Education Department, with lawmakers raising concerns about DOGE\u2019s access to internal systems containing personal information on tens of millions of Americans.",
      "In a letter to the acting education secretary, a group of Democrats is seeking to intervene as DOGE gains increasing access to student loan databases and other systems. Democrats fear it could lay the groundwork for a takeover akin to Musk\u2019s attempt to close the U.S. Agency for International Development. The letter demanded details about DOGE\u2019s work and vowed to fight any attempt to close the Education Department.",
      "Democrats including California Rep. Mark Takano planned to show up at the department\u2019s Washington headquarters on Friday and demand a meeting with leaders appointed by President Donald Trump.",
      "The department has been in turmoil as Trump, a Republican, sets out to abolish it. The White House is considering an executive order that would tell the education secretary to slash the department as far as possible and urge Congress to fully terminate it. Dozens of employees have been placed on paid leave with little explanation, and workers from DOGE have begun scouring the department's records as they look to slash spending.",
      "Musk\u2019s DOGE team already has gained access to a database housing personal information on millions of students and parents with federal student loans, according to two people with knowledge of the issue. One of them, a department employee, said a DOGE representative requested the access more than a week ago. A third person said DOGE would be given administrator access to the department\u2019s website on Friday, allowing Musk\u2019s workers to change the text on any page or take the site offline.",
      "The people spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "A federal lawsuit filed Friday seeks to block DOGE\u2019s access to student financial aid systems, saying it violates privacy rights of millions of federal student loan borrowers. It was filed by the advocacy group Student Defense on behalf of the University of California Student Association.",
      "It says DOGE could now have access to Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, dates of birth and contact information for student loan borrowers. The database also houses information on the parents of dependent loan applicants, including citizenship status and income information.",
      "The suit says it\u2019s an \u201cenormous and unprecedented\u201d invasion of privacy for more than 42 million people whose personal data is stored in Federal Student Aid systems. It says those people trusted the department with their information when they applied for federal loans and grants or filled out the FAFSA student aid form.",
      "The Education Department said DOGE is helping it return to in-person work, restoring accountability for employees and reforming the hiring process to focus on merit. It said there is \u201cnothing inappropriate or nefarious going on.\u201d",
      "\"The DOGE employees are federal employees,\" the department said in a statement. \u201cThey have been sworn in, have the necessary background checks and clearances, and are focused on making the Department more cost-efficient, effective, and accountable to the taxpayers.\u201d",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to close the department, claiming it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals, zealots and Marxists.\u201d He nominated professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to be his education secretary and quipped at a Tuesday news conference that he wants her \u201cto put herself out of a job.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s pledge is colliding with the reality that the department\u2019s existence and most of its spending is ordered by Congress. It's unclear if Trump could rally political support to abolish the department, which some Republicans have occasionally attempted but has never gained wide political popularity.",
      "The White House tempered its rhetoric on Thursday when press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and his team are looking at options \u201cto reduce the size of the Department of Education, if not abolish it completely.\u201d",

    "summary": "The South Carolina Supreme Court has set a March 7 date for the latest execution in the state&rsquo;s suddenly busy death chamber",
    "story": [
      "The South Carolina Supreme Court has set a March 7 date for the latest execution in the state\u2019s suddenly busy death chamber",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The South Carolina Supreme Court has set a March 7 date for the latest execution in the state's suddenly busy death chamber.",
      "The justices on Friday rejected a request from Brad Sigmon's lawyers to delay setting a date for his death until they get autopsy results from the inmate killed in last week's lethal injection, the third prisoner put to death since September.",
      "Sigmon's attorney said they wanted to find out if Marion Bowman was given two doses of pentobarbital at his execution on Jan. 31 and have time to look over his autopsy report so Sigmon can decide how he wants to die \u2014 with a lethal injection, in the electric chair or by a firing squad.",
      "\u201cWith the information currently available to Mr. Sigmon, he cannot begin to assess, much less contend, which method is the more inhumane,\u201d his attorneys wrote in a Wednesday court filing.",
      "Sigmon, 67, was sentenced to death for the 2001 killings of the parents of his ex-girlfriend. Sigmon beat the husband and wife with a baseball bat. They were in separate rooms of their Greenville homes and Sigmon went back and forth attacking them as he realized each one was still alive, investigators said.",
      "Sigmon then kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint, but she escaped from his car. He shot at her as she ran, but missed, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cMy intention was to kill her and then myself. That was my intention all along. If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn't have her,\u201d Sigmon said in a confession typed out by a detective after his arrest.",
      "Sigmon will have two weeks to decide how he wants to die. If he doesn't choose by Feb. 21, he will be electrocuted by default. South Carolina's firing squad has yet to be used and the last electrocution was in 2008.",
      "South Carolina went 13 years between executions before restarting them last year in part because the state couldn't obtain drugs for lethal injections. A shield law passed in 2023 keeps private the supplier and manufacturer of the drug, the people who carry out the execution and the method they use.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon and other condemned inmates have been asking for months for more information on the pentobarbital used in lethal injections and how it is administered.",
      "Prison officials told the pathologist performing an autopsy that two large doses of pentobarbital were given 11 minutes apart to Richard Moore, who was executed on Nov. 1.",
      "A defense expert who reviewed the results said fluid found in Moore's lungs probably made him feel like he was consciously drowning and suffocating during the 23 minutes from when the execution started to when he was pronounced dead.",
      "But another anesthesiologist who reviewed Moore's autopsy records for the state said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injection, and the accounts by witnesses and other evidence gave no indication Moore was conscious beyond 30 seconds after the sedative was first administered.",
      "Prison officials have not said why Moore needed a second massive dose of the sedative or whether two doses are part of their normal procedures, citing the shield law. Officials also would not say if Bowman was given two doses during last week's execution.",
      "The first inmate executed, Freddie Owens, requested no autopsy because of religious reasons.",
      "When South Carolina restarted executions in September, the state established new procedures as they changed from three drugs for lethal injection to just using pentobarbital. State officials said the protocols are similar to how the sedative is used in executions by the federal government and several states.",
      "Sigmon and two other inmates are out of their normal appeals and the state Supreme Court has promised to space out the executions across a minimum of five-week intervals to give prison staff and defense lawyers, who are often representing several condemned inmates, time to handle legal matters.",
      "South Carolina has put 46 inmates to death since the death penalty was restarted in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, it was carrying out an average of three executions a year. Nine states have put more inmates to death.",
      "But since the unintentional execution pause, South Carolina\u2019s death row population has dwindled. The state had 63 condemned inmates in early 2011. It currently has 29. About 20 inmates have been taken off death row and received different prison sentences after successful appeals. Others have died of natural causes."

      "Under the administration's plan, the agency is to be left with fewer than 300 workers out of thousands.",
      "Two current USAID employees and one former senior USAID official told The Associated Press of the administration's plan, presented to remaining senior officials of the agency Thursday. They spoke on condition of anonymity due to a Trump administration order barring USAID staffers from talking to anyone outside their agency.",
      "The agency is being slashed back from more than 8,000 direct hires and contractors. They, along with an unknown number of 5,000 locally hired employees abroad, would run the few life-saving programs that the administration says it intends to keep going for now.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the reduction to 300 would be permanent or temporary, potentially allowing more workers to return after what the Trump administration says is a review of which aid and development programs it wants to resume.",
      "The administration this week gave almost all USAID staffers posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Workers who choose to stay longer, unless they received a specific hardship waiver, might have to cover their own expenses, a notice on the USAID website said late Thursday.",

      "A number of Latino evangelical churches in Florida and in the southeast United States are gearing up to protect their sacred spaces",
      "Bishop Ebli De La Rosa says his motto right now is \u201cto prepare for the worst and pray for the best.\u201d",
      "De La Rosa, who oversees Church of God of Prophecy congregations in nine southeastern states, says he has had to respond quickly to the Trump administration's new orders, which have thrown out policies that restricted immigration enforcement in sensitive locations such as schools and houses of worship.",
      "This move has imperiled 32 of the Latino evangelical denomination's 70 pastors who are here without legal status and serve in some of the region's most vulnerable communities, De La Rosa said. The bishop has instructed each congregation with endangered pastors to prepare three laypeople to take over, should their leader be deported. He has also told them to livestream every service, and to \u201ckeep recording even if something happens.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of my pastors are holding services with doors locked because they are scared that immigration agents will burst through the door at any moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so bad and so helpless that I can do nothing more for them.\u201d",
      "De La Rosa echoes the sentiments of several other faith leaders representing thousands of Latino evangelical Christians in Florida and swaths of the Southeast. They worry about the sanctity of their sacred spaces, and the possibility of immigration raids and arrests.",
      "A statement from the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 20 said the president's executive order will empower officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to enforce immigration laws and that \u201ccriminals will no longer be able to hide in America\u2019s schools and churches to avoid arrest.\u201d",
      "Agustin Quiles, a spokesperson for the Florida Fellowship of Hispanic Councils and Evangelical Institutions, said community members, including many who supported Donald Trump in the last election cycle, now feel devastated and abandoned.",
      "\u201cThe messaging appears to be that anyone who is undocumented is a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cLatino evangelicals for the most part voted Republican and hold conservative views on issues like abortion. We want to ask the president to reconsider because these actions are causing pain and trauma to so many families in and beyond our churches. Their suffering is great, and the church is suffering with them.\u201d",
      "Quiles said his organization will lobby legislators in Washington and Florida to reinstate laws that protected sensitive spaces like houses of worship.",
      "\u201cOur main focus is the unity of families and the many children who will be impacted or left behind without their parents,\u201d he said.",
      "Pastor Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, who advised President Trump on immigration during his first term, says he has been assured on multiple occasions \u201cby those in the know\u201d that houses of worship have nothing to fear.",
      "\u201cThere should be zero angst as it pertains to churches because no one is going to come into a church with or without guns blazing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is never going to happen.\u201d",
      "However, Rodriguez said agents may surveil a church if they suspect someone engaged in criminal activity is seeking shelter there. And he said those who are here illegally \u2014 even if they have lived in the United States for decades \u2014 may be deported if they are living with or are around someone who is here illegally and has committed a crime.",
      "The National Association of Evangelicals, which says it represents 40 congregations and serves millions, expressed dismay at the executive order.",
      "\u201cWithdrawal of guidance protecting houses of worship, schools and health facilities from immigration enforcement is troubling,\u201d it said on Jan. 22, asserting that the move has deterred some from attending church.",
      "Pastors who are seeing the impact of these orders on the ground agree.",
      "The Rev. Esteban Rodriguez, who leads Centro Cristiano El Pan de Vida, a mid-size Church of God of Prophecy congregation in Kissimmee, Florida, said Latino evangelical churches \u201care like a big family that is composed of families.\u201d In his community, those who are here without legal status have even been afraid to go to work, church and to food pantries to fulfill their basic needs, he said.",
      "Rodriguez said he has been helping some congregants with reference letters for their immigration applications and speaking with lawyers to see how the church can help proactively.",
      "The Rev. Ruben Ortiz, Latino field coordinator for Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, says Latino churches have spent decades creating these sacred spaces at great cost, without relying on government assistance. Ortiz said he was distressed to hear about an incident outside an Atlanta-area church where an individual was arrested while a service was being held inside.",
      "The Bible clearly states that a church is a place of refuge and these laws challenge that sacred belief, Ortiz said.",
      "\u201cWe are getting calls from members who say they don\u2019t feel safe in our churches,\u201d he said. \u201dWe are going to respond by giving shelter. We are going to embrace all regardless of their immigration status. Everyone can and should find refuge in our churches.\"",
      "Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said he does not expect immigration authorities to engage in raids on churches that violate people\u2019s constitutional right to gather and worship.",

      "The law is murky as to whether churches can legally shelter those who are here illegally as part of their faith, but there are strong arguments to be made, Saenz said.",
      "\u201cPeople should know they have rights that protect them, and that they have allies inside and outside the church who will express their outrage if their constitutional rights are violated,\u201d he said.",
      "Latino evangelicals are in a unique spot because they are influenced by the theology of right-leaning white evangelical churches, whose pastors and leaders are also the strongest voices against immigration, said Lloyd Barba, assistant professor of religion at Amherst College in Massachusetts who studies Latino immigration and religion.",
      "Barba said the Latino evangelical community includes many independent churches and diverse organizations that lack a unified, central teaching on immigration \u2014 unlike mainline denominations such as the United Methodist Church or the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.",
      "\u201cEven the Catholic Church has a robust doctrine and social teaching on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout that, we tend to encounter a little more reluctance or uncertainty about whether Latino pastors should be engaging in this kind of sacred resistance.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba didn\u2019t skimp on the legwork as he prepared for his meeting with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba didn't skimp on the legwork as he prepared for his first meeting with President Donald Trump.",
      "He huddled this week with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, two executives Trump recently hosted at the White House. He sought advice from his immediate predecessor, Fumio Kishida.",
      "Ishiba even called on the widow of Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister with whom Trump bonded over rounds of golf during his first term.",
      "\u201cIt will be our first face-to-face talks, so I would like to focus on building a personal relationship of trust between the two of us,\u201d Ishiba told reporters before heading to Washington for his White House visit, taking place Friday.",
      "It's a tall order for Ishiba to replicate Trump's relationship with Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2020 and was assassinated by a gunman as he delivered a campaign speech in 2022. Nevertheless, Ishiba is making it a priority to connect with Trump.",
      "Ishiba, who took office in October, will be just the second world leader to visit the White House during Trump's new term. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week was the first hosted by Trump.",
      "Ishiba arrived Thursday evening for his roughly 24-hour visit to Washington. He's expected to spend a little more than two hours with Trump for a working lunch and a joint news conference before making the return trip to Tokyo.",
      "Still, making the whirlwind journey is essential for Ishiba as he looks to ensure that the U.S. and Japan stay on solid footing with the return of Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d worldview. Both countries have been challenged by China's growing economic and military assertiveness in the Pacific and concerns about a nuclear-armed North Korea.",
      "Ishiba will also look to remind Trump \u2014 who has proposed tariffs on both friends and foes in an effort to boost American manufacturing \u2014 about the long-running U.S.-Japan alliance. Japanese companies employ nearly 1 million Americans and have held the top spot for cumulative foreign direct investment into the U.S. over the last five years.",
      "Another sensitive issue Ishiba is prepared to address is Japan's Nippon Steel's efforts to win approval for a $14.1 billion acquisition of the Pittsburgh-headquartered U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden before leaving office last month blocked the deal, citing national security concern. Trump in December said he was \u201ctotally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.\u201d",
      "Ishiba isn't necessarily planning on bringing up the deal but has prepped to make a fulsome case for Nippon if Trump raises it, according to a Japanese government official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the leader's private deliberations.",
      "Nippon and U.S. Steel have filed a lawsuit aimed at overturning the blocking of the deal. And Nippon has stepped up its public push, arguing the \u201ctransaction is in line with President Trump\u2019s focus\u201d on manufacturing and \u201ccontributes to President Trump\u2019s goals promoting U.S. investment, creating U.S. jobs, and strengthening U.S. manufacturing.\u201d",
      "Defense spending is also expected to be on the leaders' agenda. Japan has pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, or 60% over five years. That level of spending meets the benchmark set for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Japan cooperates with the NATO alliance but is not a member.",
      "But Trump is pressing NATO and other allies to spend even more on defense, challenging them to raise spending to 5% of their overall economic output \u2014 a benchmark that will be difficult for countries to reach.",
      "Ishiba could remind Trump that Japan is a big supporter of the U.S. defense industry, spending billions of dollars on fighter jets and missile defense systems to try to salve any concerns from the Republican president.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is actually a good listener, too. Perhaps we (will) have a good chemistry,\u201d Ishiba told reporters earlier this week.",
      "Ishiba invited SoftBank's Son and OpenAI's Altman to his office this week as he prepped for his Trump meeting. The U.S. president last month brought Son, Altman and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to the White House to spotlight a $500 billion investment for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by the three executives' companies.",
      "Ishiba during his meeting told them that he wants Japan and the United States to deepen cooperation in AI to make the world a more peaceful and safer place.",
      "\u201cI think Prime Minister Ishiba certainly sees this is an important and critical opportunity for him to reestablish what were exceptional bonds between President Trump and Japan in the first Trump administration,\u201d said Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican who served as Trump's ambassador to Japan during his first administration.",
      "Abe was among the few world leaders who developed a bond with Trump during his first term.",
      "Abe built a rapport with Trump over rounds of golf and dinners with their wives at the president's Palm Beach, Florida, resort, Mar-a-Lago.

      "A newly appointed U.S. envoy says she hopes Lebanese authorities are committed to making sure that the Hezbollah militant group isn't a part of the new government in any form",
      "BEIRUT -- A newly appointed U.S. envoy said Friday that she hoped Lebanese authorities were committed to making sure that the Hezbollah militant group isn't a part of the new government in any form.",
      "Morgan Ortagus, a former U.S. State Department spokesperson and U.S. Navy Reserve officer, recently assumed the role of deputy special envoy for Middle East peace in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, replacing Amos Hochstein, who helped broker the ceasefire that ended the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah,\u201d Ortagus said at a news conference in Beirut\u2019s southeastern suburb of Baabda after a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun. \u201cIt is thanks to the Lebanese President Aoun and the Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam and everyone in this government who is committed to an end of corruption, who is committed to reforms and who is committed to making sure that Hezbollah is not a part of the new government in any form.",
      "\u201cWe have set clear red lines from the United States that (Hezbollah) won\u2019t be able to terrorize the Lebanese people and that includes by being a part of the government,\" she added.",
      "In response, Lebanon\u2019s presidency said in a statement on X: \u201cSome of what was issued by the U.S. Deputy Envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, from Baabda expresses her point of view, and the Presidency is not concerned with it.\u201d",
      "Lebanese parliamentarians have named Nawaf Salam, a diplomat and former judge at the International Court of Justice, as Prime Minister-designate, tasking him with forming a government in a country that has been in caretaker mode since 2022.",
      "Despite Salam's stated commitment to forming a government, progress has stalled. Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system allocates key positions among Christian, Shiite and Sunni factions, with dominant blocs \u2014 Hezbollah and the Amal Movement for the Shiites, and the Lebanese Forces for the Christians \u2014 insisting on their share of ministerial portfolios.",
      "Also in response to Ortagus\u2019s statement, the Jaafari Mufti, Sheikh Ahmad Qabalan \u2014 a senior Shiite cleric and staunch Hezbollah ally \u2014 said in a statement that \u201cHezbollah is a national and representative force of Lebanon.\u201d",
      "\u201cHezbollah has not been defeated and will not be defeated \u2014 there is no power on earth that can eliminate Hezbollah. Sovereignty belongs solely to Lebanon and its national components, not to America and its exclusionary and destructive projects,\u201d he added. \u201cA government without the national duo (Hezbollah and the Amal Movement, both Shiite parties) pushes the country into the unknown.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, under the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for Israel\u2019s troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon, initially set for Jan. 26, was extended to Feb. 18, while Hezbollah must retreat north of the Litani River \u2014 which serves as the boundary for a zone free of non-state armed groups.",
      "Lebanese army troops and U.N. peacekeepers are due to deploy in the area, but Israel has accused Lebanon of slow deployment, while Lebanon claims Israel\u2019s delayed pullout has hindered its progress.",
      "The ceasefire is overseen by a U.S.-led International Monitoring and Implementation Mechanism, made up of representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. Still, Lebanon has accused Israel of committing hundreds of ceasefire violations.",
      "During Aoun and Ortagus\u2019 meeting, an Israeli airstrike targeted Sidon province, well north of the Litani River. It wasn't immediately clear what was hit, and the Israeli army didn't immediately comment.",
      "On Thursday evening, the Israeli military said that it had struck \u201ctwo military sites containing Hezbollah weapons, in violation of the ceasefire agreement.\u201d",
      "No casualties were reported from Friday\u2019s strike or from the series of airstrikes that hit eastern and southern Lebanon on Thursday."

    "story": [
      "Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors is making a massive bet in the electric SUV market",
      "BLYTHEWOOD, S.C. -- Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors is making a massive bet in the electric SUV market with a carefully cultivated experience that will allow some customers to buy the company's vehicle in minutes on an app and then use it to handle everything after from repairs to updates and upgrades.",
      "But without some help from lawmakers, that will be impossible in South Carolina, where the company is pouring billions into its new auto plant and a Scout Motors experience like BMW's test track in Greer.",
      "In a world where almost everything can be bought online, automobiles remain an exception. Supporters of the dealership model say the experience allows buyers to compare prices across several businesses.",
      "Unlike a pair of pants, where color, style and size are about the only concerns, buying a car involves financing, state registration, taxes, regulations \u2014 and often a test drive.",
      "South Carolina is one of about two dozen states that ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers and instead require all new autos be purchased through a dealer. Scout would like to see that practice changed nationwide for all EV makers and figured it could start in its new backyard.",
      "South Carolina also bans manufacturers from owning their own service centers, which means anyone who wants to own a Scout SUV must travel to another state to have it repaired or serviced.",
      "People who back the dealership structure said online sales could lead to carmakers raising their own prices with less competition.",
      "The dealership structure requires local business owners to back what they sell and assure buyers get quality service on their vehicles. Auto dealers often have close ties to their communities and cities could lose one of their biggest businesses and heftiest taxpayers.",
      "\u201cIf for some reason the car is a lemon or the job isn't getting done, they are the folks who live there, who pay their taxes and send their kids to school,\u201d said Republican Sen. Larry Grooms, who runs the Senate Transportation Committee where any bill changing the rules would likely end up.",
      "Scout is determined to get the law changed to help them as well as other EV makers like Tesla and Rivian. They have gone on a media blitz that includes stories in local outlets. They are also trying to secure support in a Republican-dominated state with an argument that consumers should be free to buy whatever they wish directly, without a middleman.",
      "Scout also is armed with a 2000 Attorney General's Office opinion on the bill which would weeks later would become law and serve as the most recent major overhaul to South Carolina's laws on new car buying.",
      "\u201cIf a manufacturer cannot sell his own product, but must constitutionally pass that product through a \u2018middle man,\u2019 then our understanding of the free market system is way off base. The Internet is a worldwide web for trade, not a local instrument for protectionism,\u201d wrote then-Republican state Attorney General Charlie Condon in the opinion, which is not binding and an educated guess on what a judge might do if someone sued over the law.",
      "Scout officials say using a dealership-only business model would make the vehicles aimed at the under-$60,000 market too expensive and complicate what the company wants to be a seamless experience, from start to finish.",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster touts the Scout plant in Blythewood as one of his biggest economic development scores The Republican has been to both the February 2024 groundbreaking of the massive facility and this month's ceremony to mark work starting on a new $150 million interstate interchange the state is paying for to help get workers, parts and new SUVs in and out.",
      "McMaster recently said he wants to protect dealers, but wants to let Scout sell directly, too.",
      "\u201cOver the last few years with the Internet and Amazon and all the others customers are looking for their freedom and that ability to order things direct without a middleman,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "Scout is trying to find a niche in a growing but uncertain U.S. electric vehicle market. President Donald Trump's election could threaten the industry, both through ending tax credits and tariffs that could raise prices.",
      "The original Scout Motors made gasoline-powered vehicles for about 20 years when it was owned by International Harvester. Production ended in 1980, but their shape and features continue to influence modern SUVs. Scouts have had a niche fanbase of collectors ever since.",
      "The new Scout Motors is trying to tap into a mix of nostalgia and technology. Key to Scout\u2019s success will be its app, Scout Vice President of Growth Cody Thacker said.",
      "He envisions a Scout buyer scrolling through types and colors, performance and comfort options and hundreds of other choices. Financing, titling and paperwork would all be handled in minutes instead of the hours it takes at dealerships. That custom SUV could then be delivered to the buyer's door.",
      "\u201cYou see the point of contention and the huge opportunity,\u201d Thacker said.",
      "Scout's plant in Blythewood, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Columbia, is expected to open in 2027 and employ up to 4,000 people if the company can hit its goal of making and selling 200,000 vehicles per year.",
      "Scout also wants to build by its plant a center where people could test drive vehicles on a company-owned track and take tours. For it to work, the company wants to be able to sell someone a vehicle after they zoom around the site, Thacker said.",
      "South Carolina agreed in 2023 to give Scout more than $1 billion in incentives to land the plant. At the time, the dealership law wasn't on their radar. It came up as executives started looking at their business model, Thacker said.",
      "The company doesn't regret choosing South Carolina and still believes it gave them the best workforce, economic climate and infrastructure. And it will move forward if the law isn't changed selling its vehicles through other states where it can get national licenses sending the money and tax benefits out of the state, Thacker said."

      "A federal judge in Boston will consider a request from 18 states to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge in Boston on Friday will consider a request from 18 state attorneys general to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The hearing comes after a federal judge in Seattle blocked the order Thursday and decried what he described as the administration\u2019s treatment of the Constitution, saying Trump was trying to change it with an executive order. The Seattle ruling in a lawsuit brought by four states and an immigrant rights group followed one by a Maryland federal judge, who on Wednesday issued a nationwide pause on the order in a separate but similar case.",
      "In the Boston case, the state attorneys general, along with the cities of San Francisco and Washington, are asking Judge Leo Sorokin to issue a preliminary injunction.",
      "They argue that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",
      "They also say Trump's order would cost states funding they rely on to \u201cprovide essential services\u201d \u2014 from foster care to health care for low-income children to \u201cearly interventions for infants, toddlers, and students with disabilities.\u201d",
      "At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn\u2019t a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.",
      "Attorneys for the states have argued that it does \u2014 and that has been recognized since the amendment\u2019s adoption, notably in an 1898 U.S. Supreme Court decision. That decision, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, held that the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.",
      "The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them."

      "New York City is trying to deter dangerous \u201csubway surfing\u201d through education programs, but some transportation advocates and lawmakers say it's not enough",
      "NEW YORK -- Ka\u2019Von Wooden loved trains. The 15-year-old had an encyclopedic knowledge of New York City\u2019s subway system and dreamed of becoming a train operator.",
      "Instead, on a December morning in 2022, Ka\u2019Von died after he climbed to the roof of a moving J train in Brooklyn and then fell onto the tracks as it headed onto the Williamsburg Bridge.",
      "He is one of more than a dozen New Yorkers, many young boys, who have been killed or badly injured in recent years while attempting to \u201csubway surf,\u201d a practice that dates back a century but has been supercharged by social media.",
      "Authorities have tried to address the problem with public awareness campaigns and by deploying drones to catch thrill-seekers in the act. But for some, a more fundamental question is not being addressed: Why are kids like Ka\u2019Von able to climb on top of subway cars in the first place?",
      "\u201cWhen Ka\u2019Von died ... literally two weeks later, another child died. And another one. That makes no sense,\u201d his mother, Y\u2019Vonda Maxwell, told The Associated Press, saying transit and law enforcement officials haven\u2019t done enough. \u201cWhy should my child have not been the end?\u201d",
      "Making trains harder to climb, and train surfers more easy to detect with cameras and sensors, could be part of the solution, some experts say. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway system, has said it is studying the issue. But it has yet to come forward with proposals to use technology or physical barriers that might make it harder for people to get on top of trains.",
      "Six people died surfing subway trains in the city last year, up from five in 2023.",
      "Tyesha Elcock, the MTA worker who operated the train Ka\u2019Von rode the day he died, is among those who thinks more should be done to prevent deaths.",
      "The first sign of trouble that day was when the train\u2019s emergency brake kicked in, she said.",
      "Elcock discovered Ka'Von's body between the train's seventh and eighth cars. A group of sad-faced teens on the train made it clear what had happened. \u201cDid y\u2019all leave your friend back there?\" she asked them.",
      "Elcock said another operator traveling in the opposite direction saw Ka\u2019Von on the train's roof and reported it over a radio. Because of patchy radio service, she said, she didn't get the warning.",
      "But she thinks an even simpler solution could have saved Ka\u2019Von\u2019s life: locking the doors at the ends of subway cars. That would cut off access to the narrow gaps between train cars where subway surfers use handholds to hoist themselves onto the roof.",
      "\u201cLock it when we\u2019re in service so people can\u2019t climb up and be on top of the train,\u201d Elcock said.",
      "The MTA's leaders have said that they looking into possible ways to prevent subway surfing, including engineering solutions, but the agency declined to make any of its safety experts available for an interview.",
      "In 2023, Richard Davey, then the head of buses and subways for the MTA, said officials were \u201cweighing\u201d the option of locking doors between cars \u2014 which is now done only on a handful of 1980s-era trains. But he said that locking doors \u201cbrings its own risk.\u201d Some New Yorkers have complained that locking the passageways between train cars might prevent them from escaping to another part of the train during an emergency.",
      "Under questioning from City Council members and reporters last year, MTA officials ruled out some other physical interventions, including building more barriers to prevent access to tracks, or putting covers over the gaps between train cars to prevent would-be surfers from climbing up.",
      "\u201cListen, you have to be able to do work on top of a train car,\u201d MTA CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference, adding that you can\u2019t \u201ccover it with barbed wire.\u201d",
      "The MTA has asked social media companies to take down videos glamorizing subway surfing. It's also promoted public service announcements telling people to \u201cRide inside, stay alive,\" in voices of local teens.",
      "More than 300,000 New York City school children use the subway to get to and from school each day.",
      "The NYPD reported that arrests of alleged subway surfers rose to 229 last year, up from 135 the year before. Most were boys, with an average age of around 14, according to police. The youngest was 9 years old.",
      "Branislav Dimitrijevic, an engineering professor of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, said retrofitting trains to prevent roof access would be expensive.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many stories in transportation where things can be fixed, but they cost a lot of money. And then you ask the public, \u2019Are you willing to (pay) for us to fix this? But your taxes would go up tremendously.\u2019 And people say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Dimitrijevic said.",
      "Dimitrijevic suggested the MTA might be able to install cameras and use artificial intelligence to detect riders trying to climb a train. Andrew Alpert, a non-voting member of the MTA board, said he has been asking the agency about the plausibility of physical sensors but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.",
      "The NYPD has patrolled popular subway surfing routes with drones, but the missions can\u2019t be everywhere at once.",
      "Trains in some other cities, such as Hong Kong and Dubai, aren\u2019t easily climbable. They have streamlined bodies, lack handles on the outside and don\u2019t open between cars.",
      "Some rail systems have resorted to extreme tactics to keep people from riding on top of trains. In Indonesia, railway officials once installed hanging metal flails to try and deter passengers from riding atop train cars to avoid overcrowding. They also tried spraying riders with red paint and hitting them with brooms.",
      "The MTA recently purchased a few new subway cars that don\u2019t have the outdoor gaps exploited by subway surfers, but they represent just a sliver of the number currently in service, and won\u2019t be deployed on lines popular for surfing anytime soon.",

      "The summaries of evidence released Thursday include Mohammed\u2019s own statements over the years, phone records and other documents alleging coordination between Mohammed and the hijackers, videos included in al-Qaida\u2019s planning for the attacks and prosecutors\u2019 summaries of government simulations of the flights of the four airliners that day. But few other details were given.",
      "Also to be presented are the photos and death certificates of 2,976 people killed that day at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field, where the fourth airliner commandeered by the al-Qaida hijackers smashed into the ground after a revolt by passengers.",
      "The newly revealed framework of military prosecutors' potential case against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived of and executed much of al-Qaida's attack, is contained in a plea agreement that the Defense Department is battling in court to roll back.",

      "The evidence summaries point to the possibility of additional revelations about the attacks yet to come.",
      "As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors, defense and the senior Pentagon official overseeing the cases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, agreed to an unusual step \u2014 a hearing that would allow them to make public the evidence compiled against the three.",
      "It appears designed to address complaints from families and others that a plea bargain typically would otherwise keep the evidence from fully being revealed.",
      "Another unusual part of the deal mandated Mohammed to agree to answer questions from the families of victims.",
      "Military prosecutors, defense attorneys and Guantanamo officials negotiated the deal over two years under government auspices. The negotiations were an attempt to bring a resolution to the 9/11 case, which has remained in pretrial hearings for more than two decades since the attacks.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin interceded to try to void the plea agreement after it was announced, saying that waiving the possibility of the death penalty in so grave an attack was a decision that defense secretaries should handle.",
      "Federal court hearings in the Defense Department's attempts to roll back the plea agreements are ongoing.",
      "Legal arguments over whether the sustained torture that Mohammed and other 9/11 defendants underwent in CIA custody has rendered their statements in the case inadmissible and has slowed the case. So have repeated staffing changes at the Guantanamo court and the logistical difficulties of holding a trial in a courtroom a plane flight away from the U.S.",

      "In response to questions from the AP last month, lawmakers who sponsored the original legislation said they were frustrated by the delay. Experts said it is likely the stringent requirements could have saved some homes from the Palisades Fire, which became the most destructive fire in Los Angeles city history.",
      "Most of the neighborhoods ravaged by the Palisades Fire are in areas that must follow state requirements to keep the immediate surroundings of their homes free of combustible materials and would be subject to the new rules because they are deemed at highest fire risk by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The fire, driven by hurricane-force winds that spread embers by air, destroyed at least 5,000 structures across areas including Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Topanga Canyon.",
      "Under the latest proposal, existing homes would have three years to comply with the regulations, so it is not clear how many homes would have been saved. But clearing the immediate area around homes likely would have made some difference, several experts said.",
      "\u201cThese steps will spur proactive actions to defend the most vulnerable homes and eliminate combustible material within five feet of homes to reduce the risk of a home igniting in an ember-driven fire,\u201d California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said. His agency oversees the board that is responsible for writing the regulations.",
      "The executive order will also direct CalFire to add about 1.4 million acres, or nearly 2,200 square miles (5,700 square kilometers), of land onto the map of fire-prone areas, which will subject homeowners in those areas to the fire mitigation rules. Some cities and homeowners are already taking on the practice voluntarily.",
      "\u201cTo meet the needs of increasingly extreme weather, where decades-old buildings weren\u2019t planned and designed for today\u2019s realities, these proposals are part of a bigger state strategy to build wildfire and forest resilience from forest management, to huge investments in firefighting personnel and equipment, community hardening, and adopting state-of-the-art response technologies,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "State officials told the AP last month that Newsom has proposed to spend $25 million to ensure homeowners follow the rules and other defensible-space requirements.",
      "The majority of neighborhoods that burned in the Eaton fire, including Altadena and parts of Pasadena, are not on the state\u2019s fire-prone map, so this requirement doesn\u2019t apply to them.",
      "Roy Wright, CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety that supported the 2020 law, said he hasn't seen the details of the executive order but was optimistic about the Thursday announcement after years of delay.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a very clear priority from the governor that this needs to move forward,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThe administration is leaning in and says, \u2018Let\u2019s get this done. The people in California need this.'\u201d",
      "California already enforces some of the most stringent defensible-space laws in the West, which require homeowners in fire-prone places to keep the area immediately around their homes free of landscaping and other materials that could catch fire.",
      "The state began requiring homeowners in high-risk areas to clear flammable materials within 30 feet (9 meters) of their houses in the 1960s and then expanded the rules to include areas within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of structures in 2006.",
      "The latest measure creates a new \u201cember-resistant\u201d zone, dubbed \u201czone zero,\u201d that bars things like brush, wooden fencing, furniture, sheds and mulch within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of homes. The idea is to clear all materials that could catch fire from flying embers carried by winds and spread to the structure. State officials and researchers said embers are responsible for 90% of structures destroyed by wildfire.",
      "The zone-zero law passed with bipartisan support after California experienced record-breaking fires in 2017 and 2018, including a fire that wiped out the town of Paradise, destroying more than 17,000 structures and killing 85 people."

      "A federal scientific publication has returned from a forced two-week hiatus with two papers examining the health effects of wildfires in Hawaii and California",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal scientific publication on Thursday returned from a forced two-week hiatus with two papers examining the health effects of wildfires in Hawaii and California.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resumed the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which the Trump administration suspended as part of a \u201cpause\u201d on regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts.",
      "The CDC has gradually restarted some communications and reports, but the silencing of MMWR, as it it known, prompted a chorus of concern from public health leaders and some legislators.",
      "\u201cOutbreaks are not contained because scientists are ordered to stop talking about them,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said in a Wednesday night statement calling for the publication to be restarted.",
      "MMWR issues typically run 20 to 25 pages and contain four or more reports about disease investigations, health trends or other public health developments. Thursday\u2019s publication was slimmer than usual: just over eight pages, with two short reports.",
      "One of the reports was about last year's Maui wildfire. Researchers measured the blood of responding firefighters, looking for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The manmade chemicals have been linked to cancer and other health problems.",
      "Previous studies have shown firefighters have higher concentrations of some PFAS in their blood. Thousands of firefighters have sued manufacturers and companies that make firefighting gear and foam, seeking damages for their exposure.",
      "The new study looked at about 180 firefighters and 80 other county employees. It found the firefighters' blood had higher concentrations of some PFAS, but most were still at levels below a medical threshold that triggers the need for further testing. The researchers had no baseline measurements of the people in the study from before the 2023 fire, so it's hard to know if blaze contributed, the authors acknowledged.",
      "The second article looked at hospital emergency department visits during last month's Los Angeles wildfires. It found visits decreased 9% over the first six days of the wildfires.",
      "That's consistent with other research that has shown declines in ER visits immediately after natural disasters. The drop may be due to evacuations that caused people to leave Los Angeles or to get medical care from places other than hospitals. Information from hospitals in surrounding counties was not included in the new report.",
      "Before the journal went on hiatus, the CDC was expected to soon publish articles about the bird flu outbreak. A CDC spokesperson didn't say why the articles weren't published this week but said they \"are still in the pipeline.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC director during the Obama administration, said he was pleased to see the journal return but also concerned that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t contain any reports on bird flu spreading in animals and people, the new strain of mpox spreading or other emerging health threats.\u201d",
      "Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he wants to see meatier issues that have the information that researchers, local health officials and others need \u201cto make data-driven decisions.\u201d",
      "The MMWR has been called \u201cthe voice of the CDC.\u201d Published weekly since 1961, it has for generations been the main way the agency recounted disease investigations, shared public health recommendations and conveyed other health information.",
      "It had never taken a two-week break.",
      "Typically released every Thursday, the journal has more than 147,000 electronic subscribers \u2014 a readership that\u2019s mainly doctors, nurses, educators, researchers and public health scientists.",
      "A paper published in June 1981, about previously healthy gay Los Angeles men who came down with lung infections, turned out to be the first published report documenting the disease that came to be known as AIDS. In April 2009, the journal reported the first two cases of what became known as the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic.",
      "In 2020, during the first Trump administration, the MMWR became the focus of concerns about political interference with CDC\u2019s scientific work. White House officials believed CDC scientists were undermining Trump by trying to make the COVID-19 pandemic appear worse than it was.",
      "The journal\u2019s editor at the time, Dr. Charlotte Kent, later told Congress that administration officials pressed her to delay publication of at least one article and told her to delete an email that showed political meddling.",
      "\u201cIf political decisions determine which health threats to highlight, we\u2019ll all be less safe,\" said Frieden, president of Resolve to Save Lives, a not-for-profit organization that works on international public health issues. \u201cI hope the new administration will see the value in CDC publishing information on health threats every week, without political interference.\u201d",

    "summary": "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has renewed her attack on a ruling by the court's conservative majority that afforded broad immunity to President Donald Trump",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has renewed her attack on a ruling by the court's conservative majority that afforded broad immunity to President Donald Trump",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her conservative colleagues are risking the court's legitmacy with decisions affording President Donald Trump broad immunity and overturning longstanding precedents on other issues.",
      "In her first public comments since Trump began his second term in the White House, Sotomayor told a Kentucky audience that the court has gone too far, too fast on a range of issues. She cited the Trump case during a lengthy response to a question about sagging public confidence in the court.",
      "Sotomayor issued a stinging dissent in that case, and she didn't hold back Wednesday night in discussing public perceptions of the court following its historic 6-3 decision on the immunity question. The court\u2019s conservative majority, with three justices appointed by Trump in his first term, ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "\u201cIf we as a court go so much further ahead of people, our legitimacy is going to be questioned,\" Sotomayor said during the event in Louisville. \u201cI think the immunity case is one of those situations. I don\u2019t think that Americans have accepted that anyone should be above the law in America. Our equality as people was the foundation of our society and of our constitution.\u201d",
      "In her dissent last year, which she read aloud in the courtroom, Sotomayor said the court's majority allowed a president to become a \u201cking above the law\u201d in its ruling that limited the scope of criminal charges against Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and efforts to overturn the election.",
      "She renewed her objections while discussing the case to the Louisville audience.",
      "\u201cOur constitution itself has provisions not exempting the president from criminal activity after an impeachment,\u201d she said. \"So I had a hard time with the immunity case. And if we continue going in directions that the public is going to find hard to understand, we\u2019re placing the court at risk.\u201d",
      "Earlier in her answer to the question about lagging public confidence in the court, Sotomayor pointed to her conservative colleagues' willingness to upend decades-old precedents.",
      "\u201cI think my court would probably gather more public support if it went a little more slowly in undoing precedent,\u201d Sotomayor said.",
      "Other seismic shifts made by the high court in recent years have included overturning Roe v. Wade to end nationwide protections for abortion rights, and striking down affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Sotomayor said precedent-busting rulings have become more frequent, and she focused on the public fallout from courts going too far too fast.",
      "\u201cI think that creates instability in the society, in people\u2019s perception of law and people\u2019s perception of whether we\u2019re doing things because of legal analysis or because of partisan views,\" she said. \u201cWhether those views are accurate or not, I don\u2019t accuse my colleagues of being partisan.\u201d",
      "She said they \u201cgenuinely have a belief in a certain way of looking at the Constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I understand, in good faith, that they think that that belief better promotes our democracy,\u201d she said. \"But whether that\u2019s true or not is irrelevant if people are feeling insecure in the changes that they\u2019re instituting at a pace that they can\u2019t absorb.\u201d",
      "Sotomayor spent more than an hour answering questions from the the dean of the University of Louisville law school. The justice received the law school\u2019s Brandeis Medal, presented to people in the legal profession for their work advancing public service and their devotion to economic, social or political justice. UofL\u2019s law school is named for Louis D. Brandeis, a former Supreme Court justice from Louisville.",
      "Sotomayor was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama in 2009."

    "story": [
      "Minnesota House Democrats have returned to the state Capitol after reaching a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, ending a stalemate that prevented the chamber from conducting business for more than three weeks",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota House Democrats returned to the state Capitol on Thursday after reaching a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, ending a stalemate that prevented the chamber from conducting official business for more than three weeks.",
      "Under the deal, House Republican leader Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, will be formally elected as speaker for two years. Demuth, who is Black, will be the chamber's first speaker of color.",
      "All 66 Democrats had boycotted the House since Jan. 14 to prevent a quorum of 68 members needed for the chamber to operate.",
      "After the election, party leaders negotiated a power-sharing deal working on the assumption that the House would be tied 67-67. But in December, a judge ruled that one Democratic candidate didn\u2019t actually live in the district that he won, giving Republicans a temporary one-seat majority. At that point, the agreement fell apart.",
      "A special election to fill the empty seat is scheduled for March 11, and the Democratic candidate is expected to win, restoring the 67-67- tie. Republicans and Democrats will then co-chair most committees, with equal memberships from each party, though the GOP will get to lead and have a majority on a committee dedicated to rooting out fraud in government programs.",
      "As part of the deal, there will be some checks on the speaker's traditionally broad powers. Both parties will have to agree on certain major decisions, such as which bills come to the floor for debate, and Demuth won\u2019t be able to block legislation all by herself.",
      "Demuth said she intends to bring a collaborative leadership style, in contrast to the two previous years when Democrats controlled the state government.",
      "\u201cIt really felt like conservative voices were pushed out,\u201d Demuth said at a news conference. \u201cWhat I would like to do as speaker is recognize how it feels to be in the minority and rule as fairly as possible, recognizing the frustration that can be there, still doing what is needed to be done to uphold the integrity of the institution and not compromise that.\u201d",
      "While Republicans said they won significant concessions in the negotiations, Democrats said the final deal was essentially the same as the one they proposed just before the session.",
      "\"That it took nearly four weeks to reach this agreement is regrettable and was unnecessary. ... We could have avoided all of this, honored the will of the voters, and started in a bipartisan fashion from day one,\" the top House Democrat, former Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, told reporters.",
      "The last time the House was tied was in 1979, when party leaders reached a power-sharing agreement after weeks of negotiations. Republicans took the speakership, while Democrats chaired the three most powerful committees. The arrangement worked for most of the session but collapsed in the closing days, and lawmakers needed a one-day special session to finish off the year\u2019s must-pass bills.",
      "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, tied chambers aren't that unusual and often work out better than expected.",
      "Under the Minnesota deal, House Democrats received GOP assurances that they will not try to unseat a Democrat who won reelection by only 14 votes in a swing district where 20 ballots went missing. An ethics committee will hold a hearing on that race but won't take further action.",
      "The Republican Party of Minnesota ramped up pressure this week by launching a drive to recall all 66 Democratic representatives. The party\u2019s executive director, Jennifer DeJournett, declined to say Monday whether they would drop the recall campaign if House Democrats returned. The state\u2019s recall process is difficult by design and DeJournett estimated the entire process could take 10 months. House GOP leaders said it would be up to the party organization to decide whether to continue."

    "summary": "British makers of e-bikes are worried after the government scraps tariffs on Chinese e-bikes .",
    "story": [
      "A government decision to scrap tariffs on Chinese e-bikes coming into the UK has been described as a \"kick in the teeth for British manufacturing\".",
      "Border taxes were imposed on Chinese e-bikes following Brexit, keeping the UK in line with the EU, but the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has accepted a recommendation to lift them on non-folding e-bikes from Friday.",
      "The Trade Remedies Authority, the body responsible for reviewing tariffs, said the move allowing cheaper Chinese imports could save consumers \u00a3200.",
      "But UK-based companies have called the decision \"strange\" saying it's a blow at a \"very scary time\" for the industry.",
      "British based e-bike companies expressed concerns about the impact of a potential \"flood\" of cheap Chinese e-bikes entering the UK.",
      "James Metcalfe and his brother Lyle run e-bike company Volt and have a factory in Milton Keynes.",
      "They previously manufactured their bikes in China, before moving operations to a factory in Poland, and then shifting manufacturing to the UK following Brexit.",
      "\"I think this is an odd decision, and a kick in the teeth for UK manufacturing,\" Metcalfe told the BBC.",
      "\"We brought our manufacturing here with assurances that this [tariffs on Chinese bikes] was a long term change. We've invested a lot in it. We're a small business, family-owned, and trying to do the right thing by building a quality product,\" he said.",
      "The UK was already a very competitively priced market for bikes, with little need to bring in cheaper bikes from China, he added.",
      "\"What's the benefit? I don't see any. The government are saying there'll be savings for the UK consumer, but for years we've been pushing government to put through alternative savings like grants and subsidies for customers.\"",
      "\"Why not do what everyone else has done across Europe? Provide grants and invest in bike infrastructure in the UK,\" he added.",
      "Metcalfe also questioned why tariffs for folding e-bikes from China remained in place.",
      "\"I'm all for protecting the whole industry and I find it odd that they're protecting one small part of it,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, the government said it had accepted a recommendation from the Trade Remedies Authority to revoke anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese e-bikes of between 10.3% and 70.1%, and taxes designed to counteract subsidies of 3.9% to 17.2%.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Defending UK industry from unfair competition is important, which is why we've taken the decision to continue protecting UK folding e-bike producers based in the UK, whilst also lowering prices for consumers and importers of other products.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was \"continuing to take action on unsafe e-bikes\" and had recently launched a campaign \"to raise awareness of the risks of dangerous e-bike batteries and scooters\".",
      "'A scary time for the industry'",
      "The UK bike industry has endured a tough few years following a boom during the Covid pandemic, which saw an increase in outdoor exercise and many people choosing cycling over public transport.",
      "Post-Covid sales dropped dramatically, and many companies were left with stock they struggled to shift. A number of companies struggled, including Mercian and Orange Mountain Bikes, or went bust, such as Islabikes.",
      "David Miall, who runs e-bike company Wisper Bikes, said UK firms had been heavily discounting in recent years to try and attract new customers.",
      "He said the latest move by the government, which he described as a \"very strange decision\", would bring a \"flood\" of cheaper Chinese imports to an already overstocked market.",
      "\"It's a very scary time for the industry right now, and this will cause a lot of trouble for a lot of companies,\" he said.",
      "David's company designs its bikes in the UK, but manufactures them in Taiwan and Portugal.",
      "He said he had already been contacted by Chinese bike manufacturers offering very low prices for their products.",
      "\"They've overstocked too, and they now see the UK as a place to dump their bikes,\" he said, adding that he may now consider focusing solely on fold up e-bikes.",
      "\"I think the government are thinking 'Let's give e-bikes a boost' but this has been badly thought-through by people who don't understand the industry,\" he said.",
      "The Bicycle Association, which represents firms who make and sell standard and fold up bikes, said it was helping its members to respond to the new rules.",
      "\"This is a significant decision and it may take some time for the implications for the UK cycle industry and its supply chains to become clear,\" a spokesman said.",
      "\"We have for example already requested official clarification of the precise definition which HMRC will be using to identify 'folding e-bikes', which are still subject to these measures.\"",
      "What is an e-bike?",
      "Electric bikes - or 'e-bikes' - are an increasingly popular way to get around for hundreds of thousands of people in the UK.",
      "The broad term 'e-bike' is commonly used for any electric-powered bike, but it can actually refer to very different types of equipment which are covered by different laws.",
      "When most people think of an e-bike, they picture what is essentially a normal push bicycle with a small chargeable motor fitted to make it easier for the user to turn the pedals.",
      "But there are also far more powerful electric-powered bikes on the market which are sometimes lumped in with e-bikes - for example, some models can hit 60mph and are designed for off-road riding in rugged terrain.",

      "On Friday, Trump said he expected to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on many countries next week, a plan he had outlined on the campaign trail by which the US would levy tariffs at the same rates that other counties apply to the equivalent products made in the US.",
      "The US had started to re-examine the exemption for low-value packages, known as de minimis, before Trump entered office.",
      "The Biden administration in September proposed to tighten the rules on such packages from China, saying the move would help US firms compete and address challenges blocking shipments of illicit drugs.",
      "In 2016, the US had raised the threshold for exemption from tariffs and other fees from $200 to $800 to facilitate trade and allow officials to focus on higher priority shipments.",
      "But that decision has faced criticism as e-commerce has rapidly expanded and the number of packages entering the US under the $800 limit surged from 140 million to more than 1.3 billion last year."

      "Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store.",
      "Speaking publicly for the first time, the women say Ali Fayed, 82, assaulted them in the 1990s when he and his brothers, Mohamed and Salah, owned and ran Harrods.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said the businessman \"will not be scapegoated\" and he \"unequivocally denies any and all the allegations of wrongdoing\" and that \"the incidents simply never took place\".",
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence",
      "The alleged sexual assaults happened in London, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States. One of the women, a former interior designer for Harrods, says one assault happened on a work trip while she was staying with Ali Fayed and his family at their former home in Connecticut.",
      "\"His hands were everywhere,\" she says, and he stopped because \"one of his little boys started calling for him\".",
      "All three women say prior to Ali Fayed's alleged assaults, they had also been sexually abused by his older brother. Police say 111 women have now made allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, who added the Arabic \"Al\" prefix to his surname sometime in the 1970s.",
      "One of the women, Amy, has told the BBC she wants \"an explanation\" from Ali Fayed, and an \"understanding of what was going on that can help [her] step forward and begin healing\".",

      "\"This is my chance to finally stand up for myself. I'm not going to be that scared 24-year-old who doesn't know what to do,\" says Frances - who, like Amy, has waived her right to anonymity.",
      "Frances took a job working for Harrods in the store's interior design studio in 1989.",
      "It wasn't long before Mohamed Al Fayed began to bully and sexually abuse her, she says. Frances says she recalls him regularly trying to grab her breasts and grope her while at work, or subjecting her to \"foul\" verbal tirades.",
      "Despite not having much experience, Frances says she was tasked with renovating Mohamed Al Fayed's sprawling Scottish Balnagown Estate, including a farmhouse belonging to his younger brother, Ali.",
      "Frances describes Ali Fayed's demeanour as calmer than that of Mohamed.",
      "\"I think for a moment I thought maybe he would be kinder to me,\" she says. \"But he wasn't.\"",
      "Ali Fayed, like Mohamed, also had a private office and private apartment in 60 Park Lane in central London.",
      "It was in Ali's office where Frances says his sexual abuse started with him \"trying to kiss\" her, followed by him \"groping\" and \"molesting\" her.",
      "She says both the Fayed brothers would regularly give her gifts. \"With Mohamed, it would often be wads of cash, Ali would give jewellery or clothes. It would be a see-saw between abusive behaviour then praise for my work and these lavish items.\"",
      "The abuse escalated in 1992, she says, when she flew to Connecticut to discuss interior design plans with Ali Fayed's wife.",
      "\"It was this huge private house and it was decorated in an English country house style. I don't think I'd ever seen anything like it in my life,\" says Frances.",
      "\"I remember his wife taking me into this picture-perfect American rich town.\"",
      "Frances says she was staying in a guest room at the family's house when Ali Fayed told her to get changed for dinner one evening.",
      "\"I was in the bathroom and got undressed. When I came out in my underwear, he [Ali] was just standing there in the room. I hadn't heard him come in or knock.\"",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed got her on the bed and tried to get on top of her. His hands were \"inside my bra, inside my pants. I knew what his intention was\".",
      "According to Frances the alleged attack stopped when one of Ali's children called out for him. Afterwards, she says she sat on the bed, \"frozen\".",
      "A spokesperson for Ali Fayed said the businessman \"is not a perpetrator\" and will \"robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims\".",
      "When Frances returned to work in London, she says Mohamed Al Fayed \"exploded\" and started \"aggressively spitting abusive words\" because he apparently believed she and Ali had had sex .",
      "She says he told her: \"I'm done with you\u2026 go be with my brother.\"",
      "\"From that point, I'd still see Mohamed, and he'd still call me every name under the sun, but he didn't actually physically abuse me,\" says Frances.",
      "\"Now I was in fear of two of the owners and I knew if I spoke out it would get worse. I could be threatened, I could be fired. I just felt I had to keep on going and, at some point, this horror would pass.\"",
      "'I remember him laughing'",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed sexually assaulted her again later that year on a trip to Balnagown, where she was adding the finishing interior touches to his farmhouse.",
      "Ali called her into his private office, she says, then dragged her onto his lap and started kissing her neck and touching her breasts as he spun around in his chair.",
      "She says she could feel he was aroused through his trousers.",
      "\"I remember him laughing,\" recalls Frances, who says she eventually managed to break free and run out of the room. \"Laughter is meant to be nice. It wasn't. I left him there just laughing at me.\"",
      "Ali Fayed would often try to sexually touch her when they met, she says, \"always laughing and joking and making out it was fun\".",
      "The following year, Frances says she was fired for being in a relationship with another employee, something she says Mohamed Al Fayed forbade among staff. Harrods later settled a case she brought for unfair dismissal.",
      "Frances describes her time after leaving Harrods as \"going underground and shutting myself down\". She struggled to work and trust people and eventually moved away. She says Mohamed and Ali Fayed \"took away\" her confidence and dignity.",
      "\"To this day I suffer with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and I don't like people in my space,\" she says.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed and his younger brothers bought Harrods in 1985. While Mohamed was the chairman, running day-to-day operations of the luxury department store, Ali Fayed was a director and also helped oversee the House of Fraser group, which they owned in the early 1990s.",
      "The new claims point to the \"breadth of abuse\" by Mohamed Al Fayed and \"raise serious allegations\" against his brother Ali, Harrods told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\"We could not possibly speak on behalf of any individual who can, and should, respond to these allegations directly,\" it added.",
      "The store, which came under new ownership in 2010, said it hoped survivors were looking at \"every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate\".",
      "Ali Fayed, who was granted British citizenship in 1999, co-owns luxury British shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser with his sons - but resigned as director on 8 December 2024, 10 days after these allegations were put to him by the BBC.",
      "All three women alleging abuse by Ali Fayed initially spoke to filmmaker Keaton Stone, who has been investigating Mohamed Al Fayed since 2018 and whose work informed the BBC's recent documentary and podcast about Mohamed's predatory behaviour.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed never faced charges while he was alive, but the women believe his brother Ali should now be investigated by police.",
      "\"Whether any charges would be brought, I don't know, but I believe he should be investigated for what he did,\" says Amy.",
      "She worked as a personal assistant to Mohamed Al Fayed for almost three years, and says he sexually abused her throughout her time at Harrods. The abuse escalated, Amy says, when Mohamed let himself into her room on a work trip to Paris and tried to rape her.",
      "She says she \"endured\" the abuse, thinking \"that was just what being a young woman meant, it was a hazard of the workplace\".",
      "Amy says she remembers Ali Fayed coming into Mohamed's Park Lane office - and also taking phone calls from him. \"He gave me the nickname 'Amy speaking' which he thought was hilarious,\" she recalls. \"He would giggle when he spoke to me.\"",
      "A year or two into the job, Amy says Mohamed told her to go to Switzerland with Ali to help with some personal assistant duties like filing and paperwork.",
      "The pair travelled together on a Harrods private jet, she says, and were driven to the upmarket resort of Gstaad, where the Fayed family owned a ski chalet.",
      "\"Once we got to the chalet, aside from the elderly housekeeper, it was myself and Ali alone for three days. It was strange,\" says Amy. \"No efforts were made to even create something for me to do.\"",
      "The trip was taken out of season and Amy says Ali Fayed seemed bored. He suggested they go to the local public swimming pool, she says, and when they got there it was deserted.",
      "\"That's when Ali's demeanour changed and he became giddy,\" says Amy.",
      "\"He pulled me in under the water, and groped and fondled me, making me feel very, very uncomfortable - very much trapped. I was terrified thinking how am I going to get out of this.\"",
      "Amy says Ali Fayed laughed as he \"groped\" her, before she managed to break free of his clutches.",
      "After the alleged assault, Amy says they both returned to the chalet and she was left alone for the rest of the evening, feeling isolated and afraid.",
      "Like the other two women, Amy didn't tell anyone about the alleged abuse by either of the brothers.",
      "Amy says she didn't want to upset her loved ones and didn't necessarily feel people would believe her.",
      "\"By not saying anything, I think it's a coping technique, to just put it away,\" she adds.",
      "Amy went back to work after the alleged assault took place in Gstaad, but eventually resigned.",
      "She says she \"escaped and ran away\" to work abroad.",
      "\"I wanted to just remove myself from it all\", she says, but \"the trauma\" lived with her.",
      "\"To this day, in certain social situations, I don't want to be noticed, I try to stay invisible,\" she says.",
      "Ali Fayed denies all the allegations of wrongdoing - said his spokesperson - and \"will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged\".",
      "A third woman, who we are calling Laura, told us she recalls Mohamed Al Fayed summoning her to his office and telling her \"with a smirk on his face\" that his brother Ali wanted to see her.",

      "Al Fayed's brother Salah also abused us, women say",
      "Police investigate more people over Al Fayed abuse",
      "Laura had been working directly for Mohamed Al Fayed in Harrods' HR department and says his sexual harassment towards her had become commonplace, escalating to two serious sexual assaults.",
      "Laura says Mohamed sent her to their office building in Park Lane one evening, but when she arrived there was no work to be done. She says she was sent through to Ali Fayed's apartment where he was waiting. Laura says he told her they would be having dinner, and then presented her with a bottle of wine from the year she was born and a necklace.",
      "\"I wondered how he knew things about me,\" she says.",
      "Alone in his apartment, Laura says Ali Fayed ordered her through to the bedroom where she says she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. She says she felt \"numbed with fear\" and had to do whatever she was told in order to \"get out of there\".",
      "\"Afterwards he just told me I could go.\"",
      "Laura says she never saw Ali Fayed again but kept the necklace from that night and it has recently been valued at \u00a36,500.",
      "The abuse at Harrods \"took its toll\" says Laura - even after she left the store. She bottled it all up for 25 years, she says, and still hasn't told some of her loved ones what she went through.",
      "All three women are pursuing civil legal action against Harrods through Justice for Harrods Survivors.",
      "\"We applaud the bravery of the women who have spoken out on their allegations against Ali Fayed and reiterate our commitment to securing justice and accountability for all survivors,\" says their barrister Maria Mulla.",
      "\"We repeat, no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of this aim.\"",
      "The BBC spoke to three other women who said they had been either raped, sexually assaulted or trafficked by the other Fayed brother, Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010.",
      "The women who accuse Ali Fayed question what the three brothers knew about each other's behaviour.",
      "\"Looking back now, maybe they found it amusing to see how far the boundaries were with us between the brothers,\" says Amy. \"Maybe there was competition. I really don't know, but I do feel it was all amusing for them.\"",
      "Ali Fayed's spokesperson says he \"unequivocally denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing. The alleged incidents simply never occurred.

      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",

      "Don't mess with Canada - that's the private message to the US from the very top of Ottawa's political system. Just like nearly a century ago with the infamous American Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada got its retaliation in to Donald Trump's import taxes very quickly.",
      "While the White House is claiming Canada's pledge to spend $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) on a border protection plan has given it diplomatic victory in its battle over fentanyl traffic, there was very little conceded that was not already planned by America's northern neighbour.",

      "The rationale for his tariffs keeps changing and much about this situation defies logical explanation.",
      "So, Mexico, Canada and every other country facing tariffs or the threat of them have to decipher what Trump is really playing at.",
      "And when they've done that, the question for the whole world is whether what we are seeing is an attempt by the US president to rewrite the entire global monetary system - and at what risk to America?",
      "The contradictions",
      "Trump has claimed that fentanyl trafficking was the legal pretext for tariffs, allowing him to bypass Congress and use emergency powers to impose border taxes on Canada, Mexico and China, by declaring an \"unusual or extraordinary threat\".",
      "But while talking about the fentanyl trade, he also referred to Canada's goods trade surplus with the US (which means Canada sells more to the US than it imports), and introduced the idea that Canada should become the \"51st state\" of America.",
      "While any country might demand talks about both illicit and legal trade flows, it is difficult to see how to handle these conversations when there is a parallel threat of continental annexation of a free trade ally which is also part of Nato and one of the Group of Seven (G7) most advanced economies in the world.",
      "A disputed surplus",
      "Europe, meanwhile, seems unwilling to stir the pot as it attempts to work out the president's precise motivations and how this feeds itself into what he decides over Transatlantic tariffs.",
      "Trump's long-standing animus with the EU comes from the bloc's substantial goods trade surplus with the US, arising from areas such as high-end German car exports.",
      "Underlying all of this is a perceived unfairness that other markets are more restrictive against America such as when it comes to the prices paid for US drugs or fines placed on US tech companies.",
      "But if this really is about trade deficits, it is something of a mystery as to why Trump has not yet announced tariffs against the likes of Vietnam, Japan and South Korea - who have far bigger surpluses with the US.",

      "A negotiating tool",
      "In November 2024, Stephen Miran, before becoming President Trump's White House chief economics advisor, authored a paper laying out further questions that could determine how much more the US should tariff specific countries.",
      "These ranged from an assessment of whether a country applies similar tariffs to the US, suppresses its currency, respects US intellectual property, pays its Nato obligations, votes against the US at the United Nations or its \"leaders grandstand against the US in the international theatre\".",
      "It also talked of forcing other nations \"to choose between facing a tariff on their exports to the American consumer or applying tariffs to their imports from China\", asking: \"Which will they choose?\"",
      "The president himself was pretty clear in his video address to a stunned World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January.",
      "\"Your choice,\" he said to the assembled international executives. Build your goods in American factories with tax incentives, or import into the US from foreign factories and pay tariffs that would raise \"hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars\" for the US Treasury.",
      "\"Most of the world has come to understand that Trump does use tariffs as a negotiating tool,\" Stephen Moore, a former Trump economic advisor who recently visited the president, told me.",
      "Across the board",

      "\"By the way, I do think at the end of the day, there will be an across-the-board tariff imposed by Trump,\" says Mr Moore.",
      "\"He's talked about this, that if you're bringing something into the United States whether it's from Britain, whether it's Mexico, Canada, China, Europe, you're going to pay a little bit more but if something is made in the United States, he's going to lower the tax. And to a lot of Americans, that's a very attractive proposition.\"",

      "Arranging this would mean a fundamental change to the way the global monetary system operates. But Mr Miran suggests that punitive tariffs could be used as leverage to make reluctant trading partners like Europe and China \"become more receptive\" to the idea.",
      "He suggests that in time there could be a summit of the world's economic powers, where allies and rivals thrash out the revaluation of the dollar, perhaps at the president's Florida residence. It could be known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord.",
      "Early discussions of the idea in international forums have been highly sceptical, recalling the history of similar attempts to manage global currency values.",
      "But it is the recently published concept of the top White House economic advisor. Tariff now, tariff hard and tariff everywhere in order to, in the future, get the world to help bring down the value of the dollar.",
      "Show strength",
      "Such a radical idea comes with risk and already simply with the tariffs, there is a danger for the White House that the US overplays its hand.",
      "Mark Carney, who is frontrunner to replace Justin Trudeau as Canadian Liberal Party leader, and as Prime Minister, at least until an election, has a rather unique approach.",
      "The former governor of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada decided to come out punching, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and telling the BBC that Canada would retaliate \"dollar for dollar\" and that Canadians would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He said that the tariff move would rebound on the US economy itself by fuelling inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and crippling the ability of the US to sign trade deals, given they would have effectively ripped up their biggest  - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - just a few years after the president had personally renegotiated it.",
      "Mr Carney then publicly suggested that Canada removes a subsidy from exports to the US of its oil, and stressed that Canada's green investments might need to be protected from US carbon emissions.",
      "For those countries like the UK trying to avoid tariffs, he had a simple message: \"Good luck\".",
      "The clear sense was that from his own experience of having dealt with Trump at the G20, the way to deal with him was to show strength.",
      "The risk of retaliation",
      "This is partly a calculation that the muted opposition to these policies within the US will not be sustained. Again, the harder, more strategic and more coordinated the retaliation, the more pause for thought it will give big US corporates and some in the competing courts around the President.",
      "Elon Musk, the normally prolific social media poster on his X platform and chief executive of electric vehicle-maker Tesla, was curiously largely quiet about the single biggest move from the president.",
      "He eventually reposted the news from the Mexican president that their tariffs had been delayed.",
      "A leading US tech chief executive told me that his company was already making plans, assuming they would be on the receiving end of retaliatory tariffs.",
      "His hope was that Trump's focus on the rising value of the US stock market would create a natural restraint against excessive tariffs. Some saw the modest fall on the Dow Jones index on Monday as contributing to this week's pauses.",
      "Retaliation is standard procedure in trade wars.",
      "Indeed in the most famous of them all, when US Republicans passed the calamitous 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada was the first to hit back, doing so before the US had even finished legislating. History points to Henry Ford being one of those begging Herbert Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930.",
      "An integrated industry",
      "And, in 2025, the car industry is one obvious potential tariff loser.",
      "\"It's true to say that there is no such thing as a Canadian auto industry, an American auto industry and a Mexican auto industry,\" says Peter Frise, a professor of mechanical and automotive engineering at the University of Windsor.",
      "\"There are Canadian, American, and Mexican components of a North American auto industry and the integration among the three countries is absolutely foundational to how the industry works.\"",
      "Not only are models like the Honda Civic, which is hugely popular in the US, manufactured in Canada - Prof Frise says \"very few\" cars assembled in the US will not contain some parts that come from across the border. And so, says he adds, tariffs \"would drive up costs for everyone\" - US consumers included.",
      "Others diversify",
      "Another risk for Trump is that as Mr Carney and Mr Sefcovic said, they are all now responding to the direction of US trade policy by diversifying with one another. The EU is busy doing trade deals with Latin America. \"There is huge demand in the outside world for free and fair trade relationships,\" says Mr Sefcovic.",
      "The UK has also restarted trade negotiations with India and the Gulf countries.",
      "Reynolds says that the \"challenging international position\" means the UK has to push its \"genuine competitive advantage\" as the \"most connected market in the world\" with the US, the EU and China.",
      "An extensive and surprising tariff war",
      "The other issue here is that if the direction of travel is a universal tariff, as Trump and his advisors keep suggesting, is there much incentive to try to avoid it?",
      "There is some startling thinking circulating in Trumponomics circles. It is talk of that revenue grab of trillions of dollars that is spooking even allies who think they might escape the tariffs.",
      "It sounds like a wild economic gamble. But such talk is relative, at a time when the US president is putting tariffs on his closest economic G7 and Nato partner over fentanyl, while simultaneously claiming it should become part of the US.",
      "It could be an extensive and surprising tariff war. This week's trade dramas are just early skirmishes.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:05:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Equinor will slash investment in renewable energy while ramping up oil and gas production.",
    "story": [
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production.",
      "Chief executive Anders Opedal said that the transition to lower carbon energy was moving slower than expected, costs had increased, and customers were reluctant to commit to long term contracts.",
      "Mr Opedal told the BBC he was confident that Rosebank - a giant new oil field in the North Sea - would go ahead, despite a recent court ruling that consent had been awarded unlawfully.",
      "He also warned that gas prices could rise next winter as European gas storage levels were lower now than this time last year.",
      "\"We are scaling down our investments in renewables and low carbon solutions because we don't see the necessary profitability in the future,\" Mr Opedal said.",
      "It will cut investments in renewables to $5bn over the next two years, down from about $10bn.",
      "It will also drop a target to spend half of its fixed assets budget on renewables and low carbon products by 2030.",
      "By contrast, Equinor will be increasing oil and gas production by 10% over the next two years.",
      "Rosebank 'not straightforward'",
      "The controversial Rosebank oil field is thought to hold 500 million barrels of oil.",
      "A Scottish court recently ruled that consent had been granted unlawfully as the application did not account for the full environmental impact of the project.",
      "Many within the UK government - including the Energy Secretary Ed Miliband - are opposed to it.",
      "Mr Opedal acknowledged it was a divisive issue but insisted it was good for the UK economy.",
      "\"This is an important project for us. It provides local jobs in Scotland, local jobs in the UK, so we think this project will move forward,\" he said. \"We think that Western Europe and the UK should produce the oil and gas it uses instead of being dependent on other countries outside Europe.\"",
      "Climate campaigners and the oil industry both claimed victory at the Supreme Court ruling as although the consent was revoked, the court allowed preparatory work to continue on Rosebank while new consents are sought.",
      "The government said it has \"already consulted\" on emissions from burning extracted oil and gas, and will incorporate the results of the consultation when making revisions to environmental guidance.",
      "\"Our priority is to deliver a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, which drives towards our clean energy future of energy security, lower bills, and good, long-term jobs,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Tessa Khan, from the environmental campaign group Uplift which, along with Greenpeace, brought judicial reviews to stop the development of Rosebank, said Equinor was getting ahead of itself.",
      "\"I think it's in the industry's interest to make it sound like it's a tick box exercise to get Rosebank over the line,\" she said.",
      "\"There is a regulatory process that needs to be satisfied, and there are very strong public interest arguments against developing Rosebank, so we don't think it will be a straightforward decision at all.\"",
      "She added that new oil and gas fields will not bring down UK bills or improve UK energy security, as renewables would, because the oil is drilled and sold for export.",
      "\"I think we should be honest about whether or not oil and gas companies are good faith partners in the energy transition and interested in lowering people's energy bills. I think the answer now is very clearly 'no',\" she said.",
      "Trump stance 'positive'",
      "Equinor follows other energy companies in reducing investment in renewables. Shell and BP have both scaled back their future plans.",
      "Mr Opedal appeared to welcome Donald Trump's invitation to the industry to \"drill, baby, drill\" but said energy prices, not the US president, would dictate future exploration and production.",
      "\"When I hear 'drill, baby, drill', I see that as a positive sentiment to the oil and gas business but I think companies will always decide on drilling programs based on price signals,\" said Mr Opedal.",
      "\"If prices go down, less wells will be drilled, if it goes up, more will be drilled.\"",
      "When asked how this was compatible with his target to make Equinor net zero by 2050, he conceded that drilling more now would make it harder in later years.",
      "Mr Opedal also warned that low levels of gas storage in Europe as it exits this winter could mean higher prices next year.",
      "\"Gas storage levels will be lower this spring, meaning that Europe will need to fill up larger amounts of gas to keep it at the same level,\" Mr Opedal added. \"The increase in underlying demand for gas from China means more competition for energy which has the potential to increase prices.\"",

      "Last week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies.",
      "The lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop.",
      "Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets.",
      "In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC.",
      "The remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.",

      "China has accused the US of making \"unfounded and false allegations\" about its role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products.",
      "The complaint was lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) one day after US President Donald Trump raised border taxes on Chinese goods by 10%, a measure he said was intended to address an influx of illegal drugs.",
      "In the filing, China said the measures were \"discriminatory and protectionist\" and violated trade rules.",
      "But experts have warned that China is unlikely to secure a ruling in its favour as the panel that settles trade disputes remains unable to function. One former WTO official told the BBC it has \"no possibility of succeeding\".",
      "The dispute comes as Trump's plans for tariffs - a tax he has said he wants to see imposed on all foreign shipments into the country - are causing uncertainty across the global trade landscape.",
      "Trump has said tariffs will encourage firms to make their products in the US, repeatedly expressing concern about the size of America's trade deficit.",
      "But his actions against China - which he has threatened to widen to include Canada, Mexico and Europe - have sparked concerns about their impact on the global economy, including in the US, as businesses respond to trade uncertainty by holding off on investments or pass on new costs to customers.",

      "On Wednesday, Bloomberg also reported that the country's anti-monopoly regulator was preparing for a possible investigation into Apple's policies and App Store fees, hitting the company's shares.",
      "Trump's moves - which included ordering an end of duty-free treatment for parcels worth less than $800 - will be a major \"shock\" to some firms, such as Shein and Temu, as they erode the ability to offer ultra-low prices, said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But he said he thought for China overall that the effects of Trump's tariffs would not be too damaging.",

      "The US also ignored a previous finding by the WTO that earlier tariffs on steel and aluminium that were imposed during Trump's first term were against the rules.",
      "But Tom Graham, who chaired the WTO's appellate body in 2016 and 2019, told the BBC it would \"probably be a year\" before there is a decision from the first stage of Beijing's complaint and it has little chance of progressing further.",
      "\"It may be a strong case, the way the WTO dispute settlement system used to work, but it has no possibility of succeeding here ultimately,\" he said.",
      "Jeff Moon, who worked on China trade policy for President Barack Obama, told the BBC that he expected any initial WTO decision to support China's position.",
      "These cases typically take years to be resolved, however, and because the appeals process has been paralysed, \"a final decision will never be issued\".",
      "The former Assistant US Trade Representative for China Affairs added that Beijing needed to file the case to support its frequently stated position that it is the US that undermines the rules-based trading system and the relationship between the two countries.",
      "China ranked as the county with the biggest deficit in goods in December, sending $25.3bn more into the US than it purchased.",
      "The European Union, a target of Trump's tariff threats, had the second largest gap.",

    "story": [
      "As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris \u2013 and a sense that many of them are holding their breath.",
      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",

      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",
      "The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans \u2013 and wanting to seize control.",
      "\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"",

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",

      "A Palestinian and an Israeli sit in a West Bank village at night.",
      "They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability.",
      "For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.",
      "Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.",
      "The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.",
      "It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.",
      "In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.",
      "\"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,\" Yuval told the BBC.",
      "\"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now.\"",
      "Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.",
      "Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against \"illegal construction\", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.",
      "Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.",
      "On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.",
      "More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.",
      "In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence \u2013 the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.",
      "Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.",
      "Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a \"title deed\" to the West Bank and \"there's no such thing\" as occupation or settlements.",
      "When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.",
      "The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.",
      "According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the \"expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert\".",
      "Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.",
      "Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.",
      "A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: \"We have no other land.\"",
      "The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: \"You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day.\"",
      "The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present.",
      "While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures.",
      "In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, \"I feel this huge depression.\"",
      "The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: \"How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?\"",
      "Yuval told the BBC he felt \"responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community\" because \"at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money\".",
      "Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a \"situation of apartheid\" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against \"genocide\" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide.",
      "German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were \"shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel\", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an \"intolerable relativisation\" and that \"antisemitism has no place in Berlin\".",
      "Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic.",
      "Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was \"very angry\" at the label, which was \"emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing\".",
      "He said it was \"absurd\" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history \"should tell us to fight against dehumanisation\u2026 no matter who is the victim\".",
      "Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there \u2013 rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar.",
      "One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment.",
      "Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have \"unlimited power\" and there is a \"daily level of harassment\".",
      "He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment.",
      "The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would \"truly be a deterrent\".",
      "A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary \"has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion\".",
      "\"We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,\" the statement read.",
      "Yuval said: \"I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination.",
      "\"It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long.\"",
      "In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village \u2013 after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there.",

    "story": [
      "Chappell Roan has responded to criticism of a speech she gave calling for artists to receive a living wage while accepting her Grammy for Best New Artist.",
      "The Pink Pony Club hitmaker was honoured at the ceremony on Sunday and used the platform to urge music labels to provide more support, including healthcare, to developing musicians.",
      "While she received a standing ovation from the audience, music executive Jeff Rabhan branded Chappell \"disingenuous\" because she's profiting from the industry she's calling out, adding she was \"wildly misinformed\".",

      "The 26-year-old's break-out hit Good Luck, Babe! catapulted her to mainstream success last year and she was recognised with a trophy in Los Angeles.",
      "On stage, Chappell said she'd always told herself if she ever won a Grammy and had the chance to address \"the most powerful people in music\", she would demand that \"labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a liveable wage and healthcare\".",
      "Chappell, who was first signed when she was 17, shared that she struggled to find a job after being dropped by her label in 2020 and could not afford health insurance.",
      "\"It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanised,\" she said.",
      "She added labels need to treat artists as \"valuable employees\", asking them: \"We got you, but do you got us?\"",
      "Despite a round of applause from the room, not everyone agreed with Chappell's speech including Jeff - the former Chair of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at Tisch School of the Arts, New York University.",
      "In a column for The Hollywood Reporter, he said the speech was \"noble... but wildly misinformed\", calling her \"too uninformed to be the agent of change she aspires to be\".",
      "Jeff, who has worked for the Atlantic Records label and with stars including Kelis and Kelly Clarkson, said labels \"are businesses, not charities\", getting a share of profits in return for taking a risk on new artists.",
      "While he acknowledged things could improve, he also described Chappell as \"disingenuous\" for criticising the industry that \"elevated\" her to mainstream success and then \"continuing to profit from that very system\".",
      "He added Chappell was \"no longer a struggling artist\" and that \"she should do something about it  - rather than just talk at it\".",
      "In response, Chappell said on Instagram: \"Mr Rabhan, I love how in the article you said 'put your money where your mouth is' - genius!",

    "summary": "Previous comments made by Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n have been condemned since they came to light last week.",
    "story": [
      "The star of Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez has said she will stay quiet for the rest of the film's Oscars campaign, after offensive comments she wrote in the past came to light.",
      "Tweets posted by best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has released several statements and given interviews since the controversy began, but in a new Instagram post she said she now wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had already pulled out of appearing at several awards season events in the coming days. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "Her latest statement follows an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "In her new statement, Gasc\u00f3n said: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",
      "The original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

      "In a letter to Birmingham Magistrates' Court, the 59-year-old urged the court not to disqualify him as he already had six points on his licence and was required to drive as part of filming a forthcoming series of the The Trip alongside co-star Rob Brydon.",
      "His request for five penalty points to be imposed instead of six - which would have led to a six-month ban meaning \"the production would likely be unable to proceed\", he argued - was granted after he pleaded guilty to the offence on 30 January.",
      "Coogan noted that the past penalty points on his licence would be due to expire in August 2025 and that he had stuck to speed limits since the incident.",
      "The Evening Standard, which first reported the story, said Coogan also expressed frustration it had taken almost six months for the prosecution to be brought.",
      "The court ultimately decided to ban him from driving for two months instead of six, meaning the TV show can be made as planned.",

      "When The Zutons were asked to take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, they knew there was only one artist they could cover.",
      "The live sessions have been a much-loved part of the station's output for years, but it was Amy Winehouse's performance of the Liverpool band's song Valerie in 2007 that was voted the best ever by its fans.",
      "And so it was Winehouse's iconic track Back To Black, along with a live version of Valerie, that the band played in their own session at the end of 2024.",
      "A couple of months on, saxophonist Abi Harding, who took vocal duties on the cover, said it had been a nerve-wracking experience, but one she had ultimately enjoyed.",
      "\"We thought 'let's not try and be like Amy Winehouse because you can't, there's only one Amy Winehouse',\" she said.",
      "She said they considered a number of Winehouse's songs to cover, including her personal favourite, Love Is A Losing Game, but Back To Black was \"the most one suited to a band\".",
      "\"We thought we could do it and make it our own like the way she did with Valerie.\"",
      "\"It was more fitting for me to sing it than Dave [McCabe, the band's lead singer] and I'd been dying to sing a song... [but] I was so nervous to be compared to her.",
      "\"I'm never going to be her, she's an amazing artist.\"",
      "She said she was glad to have done the song justice and believed that was partially down to its subject matter.",

      "Such has been the response to the track, that the band subsequently released it as a single in December, mirroring what Winehouse, who died in 2011, did with Valerie 17 years earlier.",
      "That song started off as an idea formed by McCabe's head while he was travelling in a taxi to his mum's house, and was released as a single by The Zutons in 2006.",
      "It peaked at number nine in the UK charts and piqued the interest of Winehouse, who recorded a slowed version with producer Mark Ronson for the deluxe edition of her album Back To Black in 2007.",
      "Harding said the story was that Ronson wanted the people he was working with for his own album to do a modern cover.",

      "\"He went: 'You've come in every day singing that Valerie song by The Zutons, why don't you do that?'",

      "\"I just loved her so much... it was such a joy to hear her sing it and make it her own.\"",
      "Ronson released the upbeat version featuring Winehouse's vocals in October 2007 and it went on to reach number two on the UK charts.",
      "Harding said that had led the song to having \"a life of its own\".",
      "\"It's neither ours or hers, or anyone's... it's just everyone's.\"",
      "The Zutons' own appearance on the Live Lounge coincided with a career resurgence.",
      "Having split in 2009, they came back together in 2016 and were on the rise again with a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their debut album, Who Killed... The Zutons?, in 2019 when Covid-19 curtailed their activities.",
      "Harding said in some ways, the subsequent lockdowns were actually beneficial.",
      "\"It might have been a bit of a blessing in disguise,\" she said.",

      "Amandaland, the new BBC series which is a spin-off from the popular sitcom Motherland, has received a rapturous response from critics.",
      "The show sees Lucy Punch reprise her role as Amanda, the overbearing and competitive mother who was a viewer favourite in the original series.",
      "The Independent said the new spin-off \"will make you howl with laughter\", adding that English actress Punch \"has never been better\".",
      "The Telegraph described it as being \"both hilarious and heartfelt\", adding that lead actress Punch and co-star Dame Joanna Lumley \"make a dream comic double act\".",
      "In the show, the recently divorced Amanda must navigate parenting teenagers in her new surroundings, after having downsized, swapping Waitrose in Chiswick for Tesco Metro in South Harlesden.",
      "\"Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch's Amanda was a sure bet,\" wrote the Guardian's Chitra Ramaswamy in a four-star review.",

      "She added: \"There's lots to love... When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.\"",
      "Ramaswamy singled out one line of dialogue where Amanda reflects: \"I'm actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They've got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.\"",
      "'Ab Fab levels of relish'",
      "The \"narcissism-powered dynamic\" between Amanda and her mother, Felicity, is, the critic noted, \"played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley\".",
      "The long-suffering Anne (Philippa Dunne) also returns for the spin-off, and there are new characters, such as Amanda's downstairs neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson), celebrity chef Della Fry (Derry Girls actress Siobhan McSweeney) and her uber liberal wife Fi (Rochenda Sandall).",
      "The new show was created and written by the same team that came up with Bafta-winning comedy series Motherland; Holly Walsh, Helen Serafinowicz and Barunka O'Shaughnessy, with Horgan credited as creator.",

      "In her four-star review, O'Sullivan said the story of \"Punch's posh alpha mum, is clever, jolly and hard to resist\".",
      "\"Even in Motherland, Amanda had angst,\" she said. \"In the new show, as you'd expect, there's more time to explore her loneliness and self-doubt. What is Amanda good for? The answer is frequently absolutely nothing. But we root for this absurd and vulnerable woman all the same.",
      "\"Richard Curtis [the Notting Hill and Love Actually film-maker] minimised the realities of gentrification to an outrageous degree,\" she continued. \"Amandaland, by contrast, seems deliberately designed to get us talking about what happens to a deprived area when the middle classes move in.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Anita Singh awarded the series five stars, labelling it as \"a treat\" from both the writers and its stars.",
      "She added that Punch \"excels at physical comedy and is hilarious as she tries to style out her reduced circumstances\".",
      "\"The script is deft and the writers nail the various stages of parenting teenagers: helping them through first love, carting them home in disgrace when they've got drunk and thrown up on themselves, and realising that you can't help them with their maths homework any more because you don't understand it.\"",
      "'A modern Mrs Bucket'",
      "In another five-star review, the Times' Carol Midgley noted how spin-off series \"can easily disappoint, as Joey, a feeble offshoot of Friends, showed\".",

      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",

      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

    "summary": "The breakout star of the film has been winning awards as a stripper who marries the son of an oligarch.",
    "story": [
      "In many ways Anora feels like a fairy tale. Except that the film's title character - Ani to her friends - is a stripper and occasional sex worker. And her Prince Charming is the spoiled son of a Russian oligarch.",
      "When he spontaneously proposes, and they get married in Las Vegas, it seems all her dreams are coming true. But she quickly finds that a host of people strongly disapprove of the match.",
      "For Mikey Madison though, it is a dream of a part, where she gets to display everything from steely strength to delicate fragility.",
      "\"I recognised from the beginning that she's a very complicated character, very nuanced,\" agrees Mikey Madison.",
      "\"I always felt that she was someone who was very vulnerable on the inside. But is constantly covering it up with this hardness or an  aggression. But I do think that she's quite soft inside.",
      "\"I think that she's hopeful that this is her happily ever after, and I think that it's an opportunity and I like that she doesn't want to let go of them. And so she's going to fight to the end to try to save it.\"",
      "Both the film, and Madison's performance in particular, have been gaining huge amounts of awards momentum. It started when the movie premiered at Cannes.",
      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",
      "She calls \"everything that has followed\" an \"absolutely wonderful, pleasant surprise\".",
      "\"Especially because I think I went into it feeling really proud of the film, and like we made something special to us. And the fact that the film is also special to other people is wonderful.",
      "\"It's a dream.\"",
      "Madison was relatively unknown before Anora. She had had small parts in the fifth instalment of the Scream horror franchise and in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.",
      "The writer and director of Anora Sean Baker had seen her on screen before, and wrote the part of Ani especially for her.",
      "\"She's so unique. Not only in her physicality, but there's something about her aura,\" says Baker. \"There's something.. she's actually quite subdued, even in real life. Her demeanour is, she's quite reserved.",
      "\"But then suddenly she can explode like no other other person I've ever seen, no other actor I've ever seen.",
      "\"And I was always looking forward to those moments shooting the film, knowing that a scene would call for that. You know, to see that you don't detect anything, and then suddenly just total eruption. It was incredible to watch.\"",
      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",
      "'Oscar talk'",
      "The 25-year-old has been nominated as best actress at every major awards ceremony, including the Golden Globes, the Batfas and the Oscars. And she is probably Demi Moore's main rival for best actress at the Academy Awards.",
      "Speaking before her Oscar nomination, she said it felt astonishing to be part of the awards conversation.",
      "\"I know that I'm incredibly overjoyed, honoured, and humbled that our film is being recognised in this way. But I'm just processing it.",
      "\"It's overwhelming and amazing, and all of the things,\" she says, giving every appearance of being overcome by the acclaim her performance has been gathering.",
      "Should Mikey Madison finish off a fairy tale few months by winning best actress at next month's ceremony, she'll be one of the youngest ever performers to win that academy award, beaten only by a handful of stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, Marlee Matlin, and Audrey Hepburn.",

      "High strength nicotine pouches that are being sold illegally in the UK could cause inadvertent overdosing and harm to teenagers and young adults, experts have warned.",
      "Nicotine pouches - small sachets that fit under the top lip - are largely unregulated and there is currently no law stopping children from buying them.",
      "Trading Standards teams in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Dorset have made more than 1,500 seizures in the past year.",
      "The Oxfordshire team said it was seeing \"significant growth\" in illegal versions containing potentially dangerous levels of nicotine.",
      "The government said new legislation would stop nicotine products being marketed to children and it was investing \u00a330m in enforcement.",
      "During the last 12 months, Oxfordshire Trading Standards has seized more than 900 packets of non-compliant nicotine pouches from retailers and launched several criminal investigations.",
      "In Dorset, 844 seizures were made by officers and in Windsor and Maidenhead 21.",
      "Because the products are fairly new there are no specific regulations covering advertising, strength or age restrictions.",
      "Instead, they come under General Product Safety Regulations which means they need to be clearly labelled in English with safety guidelines.",
      "Jody Kerman, head of Trading Standards at Oxfordshire County Council said: \"Nicotine is a poison, you need to know who to contact if something goes wrong, what to do if you swallow it, how many is safe to have over a period of time.",
      "\"If it's not in English how are you supposed to know how to use it safely?\"",
      "He added that he suspects much of the growth in interest in these products is from footballers, influencers and social media.",
      "A recent study found one in five professional footballers surveyed was using nicotine pouches and nearly half wanted to quit.",
      "The general use of nicotine pouches remains low in Great Britain, with research suggesting about five percent of adults and three percent of under-18s having ever tried them.",
      "What are the potential harms?",
      "Nicotine pouches are often presented in bright packaging with appealing flavours to make them more attractive to young users.",
      "They are sometimes informally referred to as 'snus' - although that is a tobacco product that has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992.",
      "While they are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.",
      "Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine while some products contain 50mg - that is about five times stronger than an average cigarette.",
      "Some illegal pouches claim to contain as much as 150mg of nicotine, although tests conducted on behalf of Trading Standards found actual levels varied greatly.",
      "The World Health Organisation said there was a lack of data on the long-term health impact of using nicotine pouches and recommended policy makers should minimise the product's appeal and uptake among young people.",
      "Rachel Ward, a GP in Oxfordshire, warned against buying products not labelled in English saying that teenagers and young people could be exposed to dangerous levels of nicotine: \"Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, people compare it to other significant drugs like heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"Nicotine effects every organ system in our body, it has an effect on the brain, on our heart.",
      "\"It is a stimulant that will generally heighten your awareness, agitation, potential anxiety, physical symptoms like being a bit jittery, palpitations, dry mouth, so generally not pleasant symptoms.\"",

      "\"I had a sore on my gums where I first put it on and one of my friend's daughters, who was on a stand with us, tried one and she said 'I've just been to the toilet and I was physically sick after trying this pouch'.\"",

      "A few days later, they were informed their baby likely had a life-limiting illness. As the condition was inherited, the parents were genetically tested to see if they were carriers, which the trust completed and promised expedited results.",
      "The BBC is not identifying the condition to protect the family's privacy, at their request.",
      "Several weeks later, with the results still not in, the family say the hospital called to tell them they had less than 24 hours to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy as it would be more complicated to carry out later.",
      "By this point, the pregnancy was just one day under 24 weeks, the legal limit for an abortion in most circumstances.",
      "Given the clear advice from doctors - that the baby might not survive or die shortly after birth, or have a life-limiting condition - the couple decided to end the pregnancy.",
      "When a post-mortem was carried out, the baby was found not to have the condition. The trust, they say, has never provided them with an explanation for the wrong diagnosis.",
      "\"I kept calling the hospital every day asking for those test results, I had my very much-wanted baby kicking inside me,\" the mother told the BBC.",
      "\"I needed to know whether to disconnect from the pregnancy, as I didn't know if my baby would survive. They never explained we had this time pressure. Then I got a frantic call in the late afternoon one day telling me we had to decide by the following day to terminate or it would be too late.\u202fIt was horrific.\"",

    "summary": "Ricky Sawyer gave out medication illegally and some of his clients needed emergency hospital treatment.",
    "story": [
      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",
      "\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"",
      "It is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: \"People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.\"",

      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",

      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",

      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",

      "NHS experts have warned that services are overstretched trying to deal with unprecedented demand from patients wanting to try weight-loss drugs.",
      "How do Wegovy and Mounjaro work?",
      "There are two drugs on the market - semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.  Semaglutide is also used in the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic.",
      "Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens that can be self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.",
      "They work as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).",
      "This is an intestinal hormone which is released after eating, and typically makes people feel fuller.",
      "Mounjaro also affects another hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which affects metabolism and helps regulate energy balance.",

      "How much weight do people lose?",
      "People taking these drugs typically start to lose weight within a few weeks.",
      "Clinical trials suggest that - when combined with changes to their diet, exercise and behavioural support - Wegovy users could lose more than 10% of their body weight after a year on the treatment.",
      "Other trials suggest Mounjaro users might lose even more - up to 20%. But it is difficult to compare the two treatments and, crucially, users of either drug can put weight back on once they stop treatment",
      "Who can get weight-loss drugs on the NHS?",
      "At the moment, only Wegovy is available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It must be prescribed by a weight management specialist, and access to these is restricted.",
      "To qualify, adults must be obese (with a BMI of at least 35) and have at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure.",
      "People with cardiovascular disease who are classed as overweight, but not quite obese, can also be given the drug.",
      "Patients should follow a diet and physical activity programme, and the drug should be only prescribed for a maximum of two years, according to NHS guidelines.",
      "The body which assesses how all drugs are used, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has recommended that Mounjaro should also be offered to NHS patients in England from March 2025. This would be alongside advice on diet and exercise.",
      "As with Wegovy, it will initially only be available to obese patients who have a weight-related health condition and are under the care of a specialist.",
      "However, from June, the drug will be offered more widely. It is not yet clear how this will be managed, or who will provide ongoing monitoring and support.",
      "Detailed NHS England guidance is expected in early 2025.",
      "Around 3.4 million people could eventually qualify for Mounjaro.",
      "To help manage demand, NICE has said the NHS can take more than a decade to roll out access to the drug. It is thought 300,000 could benefit in the first three years.",

      "People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is \"costing lives\", a cancer charity warned last month.",
      "To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months.",
      "Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers.",
      "During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix.",
      "This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they'd known beforehand.",
      "How did you feel beforehand?",
      "Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite.",
      "\"I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,\" she says.",
      "When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more \"comfortable and casual\", she says.",
      "Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening \"for at least two years\" because of concerns about pain.",
      "But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January.",
      "Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could.",
      "Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be \"uncomfortable and painful\". But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn't find this to be the case.",
      "What did the test feel like?",
      "Jessica Tse was \"really anxious\" before her cervical screening in December.",
      "\"I didn't know if it was going to hurt\", she says.",
      "But the nurse was \"talking to me, distracting me throughout\" and explained the procedure \"really clearly\", she adds.",
      "\"Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn't felt before,\" Bianca recalls.",
      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",
      "Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says \"you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things\".",
      "While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.",
      "\"Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,\" the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful.",
      "The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and \"can ask the nurse to stop at any time\".",
      "Did you know about the adjustments available?",
      "People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include:",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",
      "\"It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,\" Jack says. \"It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be.\"",
      "Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix.",
      "How could the process be improved?",
      "The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040.",
      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings \"very worrying and uncomfortable\".",
      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

    "summary": "Bank boss Andrew Bailey told the BBC it expected to cut rates further but warned the road ahead would be bumpy.",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for this year as it cut interest rates to the lowest level for more than 18 months.",
      "The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75% in 2025, the Bank said, down from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Low growth and rising prices - it's looking gloomy for the UK",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",
      "\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps on it,\" he added.",
      "After the rates announcement, the pound slumped, before regaining ground.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",
      "However, it also predicted that higher energy and water bills would push up inflation \"quite sharply\" later this year, and warned there were a number of factors that could affect inflation including possible trade tariffs in the US.",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is now expected to rise to 3.7% and take until the end of 2027 to fall back to its 2% target.",
      "Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of measures to try to boost the UK economy.",
      "However, her decision in last year's Budget to increase employers' National Insurance contributions from April has led to a wave of criticism from businesses, who argue it will push up prices and hit investment and jobs.",
      "Mr Bailey said the impact of the Budget, particularly the looming higher costs of employing people, was feeding through into lower confidence for businesses and households.",
      "\"There's no question that the increase in the cost of employment does have an effect,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We're very focused on how that increased cost of employment is going to pass through.\"",
      "Sir Keir told the BBC the government would turn the economy around with a focus on \"build baby build\" and by making \"tough decisions whether on planning, on infrastructure, on nuclear\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said while the rate cut would be good news for many families and businesses, the government's \"disastrous Budget\" was likely to mean fewer rate cuts this year than expected.",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said it was \"very worrying\" for the government that the Bank of England has \"really, quite significantly\" downgraded its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "He added that if the official government forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - changes its forecast in line with the Bank's then \"the chancellor is in big trouble\" when it comes to meeting her self imposed debt rules.",
      "\"That means... the tax revenues the chancellor is relying on are unlikely to come in as expected, and even tougher choices on spending and tax going forward.\"",
      "Mortgage impact",
      "The interest rate cut means that for the 629,000 homeowners on mortgage tracker deals that move in line with the base rate, there will typically be a \u00a329 fall in monthly repayments.",
      "The near 700,000 people on standard variable rate mortgages will have to wait to see if their lender responds.",
      "Those on a fixed mortgage deal will see no immediate change, but there might be cheaper deals available for new and renewing customers.",
      "However, the rate cut is likely to lead to lower returns for savers.",
      "Nicola Price and her husband John have still got 18 months remaining on their current mortgage deal, and welcome lower interest rates as it means they will pay less interest on their next mortgage - if rates remain low.",
      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",
      "However, the couple also see that falling interest rates aren't good news for everyone as their parents \"rely heavily\" on a better interest rate on their savings.",
      "In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said economic growth had been \"broadly flat since March last year\".",
      "The UK economy showed zero growth between July and September.",
      "For the following three months, the Bank of England now expects it to shrink by 0.1% against a previous forecast of 0.3% growth.",
      "A recession is defined as two consecutive three-month periods of economic contraction.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 08:43:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The Public Accounts Committee warns the government of gambling public money on carbon capture.",
    "story": [
      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "story": [
      "Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas, who has died aged 78, went from a maverick to a member of the political establishment.",
      "During a career that involved 12 years as the Welsh Assembly's first Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the Speaker of the House of Commons, he was never far from controversy and criticism.",
      "Sometimes the criticism came from his own party, particularly when he accepted a peerage and attacked Welsh language nationalism.",
      "Eventually he would quit Plaid Cymru and sit as an independent member in Cardiff Bay.",
      "Some might not have liked the way he held forth on controversial topics while holding an office that demanded neutrality.",
      "But he saw it as his job to stand up for a fledgling legislature - a job that sometimes needed an outspoken figure.",
      "Dafydd Elis-Thomas was born in Carmarthen in 1946, and educated at Llanrwst Grammar School and Bangor University.",
      "He led Plaid Cymru's youth section and campaigned against the 1969 investiture of Prince Charles in Caernarfon castle.",
      "'Baby of the house'",
      "In 1974 he was one of three Welsh nationalists elected to the House of Commons with Gwynfor Evans and Dafydd Wigley.",
      "At 27, he was the youngest member of that parliament - the \"baby of the house\".",
      "The other Dafydd beat him in a contest to lead Plaid when Mr Evans, a giant in the party, stood down in 1981.",
      "The battle for the succession was a battle to decide whether Plaid tacked to the left under Dafydd El or held a more moderate course under Dafydd Wigley.",
      "Following Mr Wigley's resignation, he was elected party president in October 1984, beating Dafydd Iwan, the candidate from the party's traditionalist wing.",
      "Under Lord Elis-Thomas's leadership, Plaid gave strong support to the miners in their strike of 1984 and won a third seat in parliament at the 1987 election.",
      "He stood down as an MP in 1992 and was ennobled as a cross-bench peer in the same year, despite his party's opposition to the Lords at the time.",
      "He served as chairman of the Welsh language board from 1994-99 before his election as Plaid Cymru Assembly member for Meirionydd Nant Conwy.",
      "He served as presiding officer of the Welsh Assembly, now called the Senedd, from 1999 to 2011, but the role did not stop him making headlines with his outspoken views.",
      "He clashed bitterly with the then first secretary Alun Michael in 2000 over procedures surrounding a no-confidence vote in Mr Michael's handling of European funding.",
      "He was an early advocate for a separation between the assembly and its executive - a divide that was finally enacted in the Government of Wales Act 2006.",
      "He ignited furious debate in 2001 when he said there was an anti-English feeling within Welsh language nationalism and there was no such thing as a Welsh-speaking heartland.",
      "He was known for a memorable turn of phrase, such as this take on a row about where assembly members sit in the chamber: \"What is the point of getting up in the morning, cleaning my teeth, washing and shaving if you go to work in an institution like this.\"",
      "He pushed for a more powerful assembly, calling for the devolution of control over policing and broadcasting.",
      "He intervened in a spat between Westminster and Cardiff Bay about devolving powers over housing policy, accusing some Welsh MPs of \"acting contrary to the spirit of devolution\".",
      "Not everyone appreciated his style.",
      "Despite having neighbouring offices during the second assembly, he and former deputy presiding officer John Marek barely spoke after rowing about a departing official.",
      "He called for assembly members to boycott a meeting with the Israeli ambassador, organised by the assembly's only Muslim AM,.",
      "In 2011 he provoked a furious reaction from Labour and the Conservatives when he said the Wales Office should be scrapped in the wake of the referendum to give the assembly direct law-making powers.",
      "Soon after, he let it be known he would enter the contest to succeed outgoing Plaid leader Ieuan Wyn Jones.",
      "Twenty years after he vacated the role of party president, it was a typically provocative move from one of Welsh politics' most colourful characters.",
      "That contest was won by Leanne Wood, who Elis-Thomas went on to clash with over the direction of Plaid Cymru.",
      "In 2016 he quit the party to sit as an independent member in Cardiff Bay.",
      "He said it was because Plaid Cymru was not \"serious\" about taking part in the Labour-led Welsh government.",

      "Landlords who fail to comply face being taken to court and ordered to pay compensation.",

      "Awaab's law was first passed in July 2023 under the previous Conservative government but has not yet been brought into force.",

    "summary": "The government wants to make it quicker and easier to build mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"build baby build\", as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built - made up of just eight sites - will also be scrapped.",
      "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
      "How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?",
      "Starmer goes nuclear in hunt for long-term growth",
      "Sir Keir said the plans would improve the country's energy security by increasing the supply of clean, homegrown power.",
      "He added that Britain had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in energy prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, said the changes would give investors certainty and enable them to get on with building new plants.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "The previous Conservative government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast - Sizewell C - in 2022.",
      "The new Labour government committed a further \u00a32.7bn to the project in October but a final decision on its future is not due to come until the spending review later this year.",
      "Two new nuclear reactors are also being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which are due to open in 2030.",

      "Under her plan, the residency status would not be granted to migrants with criminal records, or those who had claimed benefits or social housing.",
      "The Tory leader said the right to citizenship and permanent residency \"should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK\".",
      "Downing Street said there was \"very little to no evidence that citizenship acts as a pull factor for people choosing to come to the UK\".",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman added: \"The issue facing the UK is the record high levels of migration that have been seen over recent years and that's why the government is focussed on tackling the root causes behind those numbers with measures that make a difference.\"",
      "Indefinite leave to remain (ILR) gives people the right to live, work and study in the UK.",

      "She argued too many people were getting citizenship through this route and that was \"creating a strain on public services\".",
      "\"We need to make sure that people coming here have a real, meaningful connection to the UK, so no criminal records, they should be net contributors to the economy, not relying on benefits but people who care about our country and our communities.\"",

      "Last year, shortly after becoming Conservative leader, Badenoch said her party had got it \"wrong\" on immigration during its time in government, which saw net migration rise to a record high of 906,000.",
      "She has said there should be a hard cap on migrant numbers but declined to say what it should be set at, arguing it would depend on the situation at any given time.",
      "Asked if she was panicking because of the rising popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK, Badenoch said her party \"needed to rebuild trust with the public\" and that it was natural for the public to look to \"the protest party\".",

      "The Met's Cdr Owain Richards said: \"We are seeing phone thefts on an industrial scale, fuelled by criminals making millions by being able to easily sell on stolen devices either here or abroad.",

      "Local elections in East Sussex, West Sussex, Essex, Thurrock, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Suffolk and Surrey will be delayed for one year to allow major reorganisations to take place, Local Government Secretary Angela Rayner has said.",

      "She said that holding elections for authorities that were due to be scrapped would be \"an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "However, Conservative shadow minister Kevin Hollinrake said the \"mass postponement\" was a \"worrying day for democracy\".",
      "The shake-up of local councils, announced by the government last year, will see smaller district councils merged with local county councils to create single bodies known as unitary authorities.",

      "\"These places will get a fast-track ticket to drive real change in their area,\" she told MPs.",

      "In January, the government said that of the 21 county councils due to hold elections, 16 had requested postponements. Two of the 10 unitary councils had also made the same request.",
      "On Wednesday, Rayner told MPs she had only agreed to half of the requests for postponements made by local authorities, and that delaying elections to allow for restructuring was a \"well established precedent\".",
      "\"After careful consideration, I've only agreed to postpone elections in places where this is central to our manifesto promise to deliver devolution,\" she said.",

      "One senior Tory councillor said: \"You need economies of scale for housing, transport, schools and roads rather than what happens now, which is people don't know where to go if their bins aren't collected, and they don't know which council does what \u2013 this is a much more simple and hopefully cheaper way of providing services.\"",

    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "title": "Record January warmth puzzles climate scientists",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "summary": "The government wants to make it quicker and easier to build mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"build baby build\", as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built - made up of just eight sites - will also be scrapped.",

      "How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?",
      "Starmer goes nuclear in hunt for long-term growth",
      "Sir Keir said the plans would improve the country's energy security by increasing the supply of clean, homegrown power.",
      "He added that Britain had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in energy prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, said the changes would give investors certainty and enable them to get on with building new plants.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "The previous Conservative government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast - Sizewell C - in 2022.",

      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",

      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",

      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 02:37:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The Built Environment Committee says the concept has been \"eclipsed\" by other planning rule changes.",
    "story": [
      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",
      "He said the idea of a grey belt had initially \"intrigued\" committee members who believed it could \"make a positive contribution\" to meeting housing targets.",
      "Some councils ordered to increase home building by 400%, new BBC tracker shows",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Housing plans not war on rural England, says minister",
      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",
      "\"We have seen more than a handful of successful appeals in the eight weeks since the grey belt concept was confirmed in the NPPF.\""

    "title": "UN monitors asteroid with a tiny chance of hitting Earth",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

      "However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures.",
      "\"Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,\" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK.",
      "\"They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk.\"",
      "Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.",
      "The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it.",
      "Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect.",
      "\"We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],\" she explained. \"Then we add another krill and take another measurement.\"",

      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
      "\"If there is a chance, I'd definitely love to take on the challenge,\" he said."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",
      "While The Sims is often seen as a leader when it comes to inclusivity in gaming, some people are uncomfortable with its approach.",
      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",
      "It has added certain features - such as visible hearing aids - to improve the representation of disability in the game.",
      "Press X to sniff: Can smelling a game make it more immersive?",
      "Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft praised at gaming accessibility awards",
      "Cher Lloyd on making new music, Swagger Jagger and Liam Payne's unmatched talent",

      "Critics argue these schemes are discriminatory and used to push political agendas, while supporters argue that they work to combat inequalities.",
      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",
      "\"The bigger concern is that this will be seen as a green light for certain groups of toxic gamers to become more open about their own hateful views, making inclusive spaces more important than ever,\" says Zoe.",
      "Simmer Amira says it's especially important for a life simulation game such as The Sims to include as many people as possible.",
      "\"Everybody should be able to, for the most part, make themselves with little to no issue,\" she says.",
      "Jesse adds: \"A lot of people don't get to experience things that other cultures experience and it's a really great way to implement learning about it in everyday life.",
      "\"I think that goes a long way to acceptance as well.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "title": "Tourists flee and homes break apart in Santorini, but resilient locals remain",
    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:22:44 GMT",
    "summary": "People started evacuating the island as it was shook by tremors - but not everyone is fleeing.",
    "story": [
      "On a calm summer day on Santorini in July 1956, the ground turned against its people.",
      "\"I remember our dog and bird acting strangely. Then, the earthquake struck,\" 83-year-old Eirini Mindrinou recalls, her voice steady but distant, as if trying to grasp a memory that never truly faded. \"The house split open before closing again. Through the crack in the roof, I could see the sky.\"",
      "The 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, destroyed much of the island, and a powerful aftershock 12 minutes later finished what little remained. Fifty-three people died. The island, then just a quiet fishing village, was scarred and its people fled.",
      "It is much different today, rebuilt into one of Greece's most coveted tourists destinations \u2013 but this week, another mass exodus unfolded. Subtle tremors that had begun in June 2024 turned into full-fledged earthquakes, some exceeding 4.0 on the Richter scale, shaking homes and unsettling the island's residents. Families rushing to leave by air and sea, desperately seeking respite as the ground shook once again.",
      "But not everyone is fleeing. Those that remain display the mix of courage, necessity, and a deep connection to the land that has come to define the locals of this island. They endure sleepless nights, haunted by memories of the past and the terrifying unknown of what's yet to come.",
      "\"The noise from the earthquake, the sounds of [other people's] homes breaking apart - it's unbearable. Even in my house, it's become overwhelming,\" says Margarita Karamolegkou, a local businesswoman. \"I've felt tired, day after day, with no end in sight\u2026 But I haven't felt fear. I can't leave my home, and I can't leave the people who've stayed behind.\"",
      "This resilience is nothing new. People have have withstood both social change -about 3.4 million visited the island last year, according to Mayor Nikos Zorzos - and seismic shifts. Now, as always, they have come together in solidarity.",
      "\"We're doing our best to support the vulnerable,\" says Matthaios Fytros, a local volunteer and merchant. \"People with disabilities, the elderly - many struggle to get around, and their homes are hard to reach. If a major earthquake hits, I know exactly where they live, and I'll get to them as fast as I can, alongside the firefighters.\"",
      "Matthaios and others patrol the island, ensuring abandoned properties aren't looted and helping anyone in need. \"I'm not afraid,\" he says with quiet conviction. \"We're proud of our island. I just hope everything works out and that this ordeal ends soon. We'll be happy to have our visitors back with us.\"",
      "The response of the state has been swift, with measures taken to address the crisis. Beneath the gratitude for the government's intervention, however, lingers a quiet bitterness. Many islanders recall the years when their cries for better infrastructure and support went unheard.",
      "\"For years, we've been asking for a better port, something to help us manage the growing number of tourists,\" Margarita says, her voice tinged with frustration. \"We need help preserving the island's identity - its unique environment, the seismic and volcanic forces that shape it. We're grateful for the tourists, but we also need to protect what makes Santorini special.\"",
      "Tourism has become the lifeblood of Santorini's economy. The island contributes around 2.5% to Greece's GDP, approximately 5.9 billion euros (\u00a34.9 billion) each year.",
      "As the tremors continue, the future of Santorini's economy remains uncertain. Will its prosperity withstand the shaking ground? The people of Santorini worry that the island's fragility may soon extend beyond the land itself.",
      "\"I regret how haphazard the island's development has been with the rise in tourism,\" says Eirini, who is temporarily in Athens, not out of fear, but for routine medical tests. \"We've damaged the natural environment here. Now, with the earthquakes continuing, there's a real risk we could lose the entire tourist season.\"",
      "Scientists may not know when the shaking will stop, but instead of succumbing to fear, some residents have chosen to understand the phenomenon, hoping that will bring them reassurance in the face of the unknown.",
      "\"I try to think of what's happening with kindness,\" Margarita says thoughtfully. \"It feels like something is settling down there. Everything we admire about Santorini today - the beauty, the character - has been shaped by the volcano and its seismic forces.\"",
      "\"We are the most beloved island,\" says Matthaios, his voice full of pride. \"And I believe we're the most beautiful of all the islands in Greece. We will get out of this stronger.\""

    "title": "Sweden's worst mass shooting leaves immigrant community on edge",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 09:52:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Among the dead in Sweden's first school shooting were Syrians and Bosnians.",
    "story": [
      "In the middle of a grand, high-ceilinged church in Orebro, Sweden, Jacob Kasselia, a Syrian orthodox priest, looked up towards the stained glass windows above him, then back down at his hands. He adjusted the gold cross hanging from his neck.",
      "\"The police say this man acted alone,\" the priest said. \"But this hate, it is coming from somewhere.\"",
      "A member of Kasselia's congregation, 29-year-old Salim Iskef, was among those murdered in Orebro on Tuesday in Sweden's first school shooting and the worst mass shooting in the country's history. The gunman killed 10 students at an adult learning centre and then himself.",
      "Among the dead are Syrians and Bosnians, according to residents and the embassies of those countries, but the police in Orebro have not given any details of the victims publicly.",
      "Kasselia described Iskef as kind and thoughtful, keen to help other members of the community. He came to Sweden with his mother and sister, the priest said - refugees from Aleppo, where his father was killed in the war. Iskef was studying Swedish at the Risbergska school, the target of Tuesday's attack.",
      "\"He was simply a good man,\" the priest said. \"He did not look for trouble. He showed only goodwill. He was a member of our community.\"",
      "The night after the attack, Kasselia sat with Iskef's family to console them. Iskef was engaged and due to be married this summer. His fiancee Kareen Elia, 24, was \"very badly affected\", the priest said, and was \"going through a very difficult, very dark experience\".",
      "At a memorial service in Orebro on Thursday night, Elia broke down in screams and tears and had to be carried out of the church.",
      "In the days since the shooting, there has been a striking lack of information from the authorities. On Thursday night, police had still not confirmed the identity of the gunman - widely reported by Swedish media to be 35-year-old local Rickard Andersson - nor any details about his motive or the victims.",
      "In a statement issued early on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the attack, police said the shooter did not appear to be motivated by any ideology. On Thursday, Anna Bergkvist, who is leading the police investigation, appeared to walk the statement back.",
      "\"Why they said that, I cannot comment,\" she told the BBC. \"We are looking at different motives and we will declare it when we have it.\"",
      "Swedish police are usually cautious about naming suspects during an investigation, but the absence of official information has contributed to a feeling of fear and uncertainty among Orebro's immigrant communities over the past few days.",
      "\"We are getting all our information from the media and I don't know why,\" said Nour Afram, 36, who was inside the Risbergska school when the attack began.",
      "\"We need more information,\" she said. \"We don't know why he did it, why did he target this school? Was he sick or was it something else?\"",
      "Afram was waiting to go into class when she heard people screaming that there was a shooter - something so unbelievable to her she thought at first it was a prank.",
      "\"We started to run and then I heard the gunshots,\" she said. \"One at first, then tak tak tak -  maybe ten shots. I was so scared I felt like my heart stopped in my chest.\"",
      "Afram, who immigrated from Syria to Orebro as a child, said she was afraid for the first time to send her three children to school in Sweden.",
      "Zaki Aydin, a 50-year-old Syriac language teacher in Orebro, said he was afraid for the first time for his young students, who are mostly from the Middle East. \"We are foreigners, we have to be careful now,\" he said.",
      "Aydin used to have the doors of his classroom and the church building open when he taught. \"Now we are closing them,\" he said. \"And yesterday I asked someone to stand outside to prevent anyone we didn't know already from coming in.\"",
      "One of the pupils at the school, 18-year-old Gabriel, said a \"nightmare had come true\" for Orebro.",
      "\"The problem is we have no motive, only speculation,\" he said. \"A lot of people my age are frightened to go to school, we feel like Sweden has become like America. The things you see on television have happened here.\"",
      "In the absence of any official news about the motive, all that the residents here in Orebro know is that the killer appears to have been a reclusive white Swedish man and that he targeted a school with a large immigrant student base.",
      "Tomas Poletti Lundstrom, an academic researcher in racism at Uppsala University, who happens to live just a few minutes from the site of the attack and heard police helicopters fly over his home on Tuesday, said Orebro was facing a \"deeply horrible time\".",
      "\"You can really sense it everywhere here, it is affecting everyone,\" Lundstrom said. \"We don't know the motives of the shooter yet, but we are living in a very racist time and this is a school for a lot of immigrants.\"",
      "Attacks like the one at Risbergska were \"the outcome of how our society looks at the moment, how our politicians talk, and how we talk about one another\", he said.",
      "\"The government and the main opposition support anti-immigrant policies and use anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" he added. \"This is what happens when politicians speak the way they are speaking.\"",
      "At the cordoned off entrance to Risbergska school early on Thursday morning, people were stopping by to leave flowers, light candles, or simply to stand and take in the scene. From the street, you can clearly see the front door through which the killer was filmed appearing to go from classroom to classroom with a rifle.",
      "Among those who came alone and stood for a while by the collection of candles and flowers was the city's mayor, John Johansson, who had made an official visit to the site the day before alongside the prime minister and the king and queen but stopped there again on his way to work on Thursday to pay his respects.",
      "\"I hope that the police will find conclusions soon,\" Johansson said. \"The city needs answers, our society needs answers, and the families of the victims need to know why this happened.\"",
      "But it was not time to \"speculate or rush ahead\", he said. \"We do not want to contribute to any false rumours, and so we hope the police will find answers as early as possible.\"",
      "Tony Estroem, a salesman from Eskilstuna, about 80km from Orebro, also stopped by the school on Thursday morning. \"This kind of shooting, at a school, you read about it elsewhere but not in Sweden,\" he said.",
      "\"It looks to be a Swedish guy, and perhaps that is better than if it had been an immigrant responsible,\" he added. \"Of course it is a terrible event either way, but we do not want to add more fuel to the fire.\"",
      "Police have given out some limited information about their investigation. They said that about 130 officers responded to the shooting in total, and that they were met by an \"inferno\" in the school. They said that they believe the gunman acted alone.",
      "Family members, former school friends and neighbours have told Swedish media he had become a recluse in recent years and may have suffered with psychological issues.",
      "There have been complaints about the handling of the case. The Bosnian ambassador Bojan Sosic, who also visited the site of the shooting, learned from residents that a Bosnian was among the dead.",
      "\"I find it odd, to say the least, that the police chooses to withhold information that pertains to foreign citizens from respective embassies,\" he said.",
      "Others, including members of the Syrian community, said they trusted the police were doing the right thing and only hoped to learn more soon. Kasselia, the Syrian Orthodox priest, said that the wider community \"does not know what the police are thinking, but we trust that they have their own plan\".",
      "Hundreds of people came to Kasselia's church on Thursday night from the Syrian, Turkish, Iraqi and other migrant communities. A picture of Salim Iskef, one of the shooting's victims, sat on an easel. Children from the congregation sung hymns. Iskef's family, sitting in a pew near the front, were consumed by grief.",
      "It is difficult to understand why these sorts of attacks happen even when the motive is known. Without it, it is even more confounding. A few hours before the memorial service began, Kasselia had been sitting in a pew in his empty church, trying to make sense of it.",
      "\"People die, of course. They become sick, they have some accident,\" he said. \"But this, how can we understand this? To be shot dead in a school. We could not dream of this. We cannot even describe it. Why?\"",
      "There was some comfort in hearing from the police that the gunman acted alone, Kasselia said. It left less anxiety of another attack.",
      "\"But this man had something in his heart, some kind of hate, that he gathered from somewhere,\" the priest said. \"We cannot say there are not others.\"",

    "summary": "A haven for the super rich, or a city built on scams? The BBC was invited to find out.",
    "story": [
      "The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it.",
      "Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.",
      "It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.",
      "But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos \u2013 as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.",
      "The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.",
      "She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.",
      "But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.",
      "Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism \u2013 Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.",
      "Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.",
      "Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.",
      "So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.",
      "Inside Shwe Kokko",
      "Getting there is tricky.",
      "Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.",
      "As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon \u2013 through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.",
      "She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees \u2013 \"Mr She believes in making a green city,\" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.",
      "At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.",
      "Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. \"Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,\" they told us. And what about the businesses? \"Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.\"",
      "However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.",
      "Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.",
      "Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.",
      "The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.",
      "Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.",
      "We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.",
      "Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.",
      "\"The target is the elderly,\" she said. \"You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.\"",
      "Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.",
      "\"When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,\" she says. \"The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.\"",
      "During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.",
      "Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border.",
      "We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.",
      "\"Everybody in Shwe Kokko knows what goes on there,\" said the young woman who used to work in a scam centre.",
      "She dismissed Yatai's claim that it no longer permitted scam centres in Shwe Kokko.",
      "\"That is a lie. There is no way they don't know about this. The whole city is doing it in those high-rise buildings. No-one goes there for fun. There is no way Yatai doesn't know.\"",
      "Who is She Zhijiang?",
      "\"I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,\" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held.",
      "Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him.",
      "Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind.",
      "Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China.",
      "This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas.",
      "He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.",
      "In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe.",
      "Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (\u00a312.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world.",
      "China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar.",
      "In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.",
      "She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.",
      "He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.",
      "While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to \"a high probability\" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.",
      "\"Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.\"",
      "It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city.",
      "It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here.",
      "With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly.",
      "Yatai's strategy is \"to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city\", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko.",
      "He says they may even \"begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones\".",
      "But he doesn't think the plan will work: \"What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.\"",
      "A business in a war zone",
      "When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down.",
      "Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty.",
      "The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around.",
      "The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.",
      "It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us \u2013 not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said.",
      "The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them.",
      "We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty.",
      "The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam.",
      "They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there.",
      "They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down.",
      "Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.",
      "In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.",
      "Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. \"We are just property developers,\" he said. \"I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here.",
      "\"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.\"",
      "But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border.",
      "Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.",
      "Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.",
      "It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses \u2013 and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.",
      "Neither do recent headlines.",
      "Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him.",

    "summary": "Scientists say it is unclear how many more earthquakes will come to the idyllic Greek island.",
    "story": [
      "\"We've put all our mattresses in the living room,\" says Georgia Nomikou.",
      "The Santorini resident fears the impact of ongoing earthquakes on the Greek island, popular with tourists for its picture-postcard views.",
      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",
      "The \"clusters\" of quakes have puzzled scientists who say such a pattern is unusual because they have not been linked to a major shock. So what's going on?",
      "What is happening in Santorini?",
      "Experts agree the island is experiencing what Greece's prime minister has called an \"extremely and intricate geological phenomenon\".",
      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",
      "Meanwhile, additional police units and military forces have been deployed to the island to help it cope with any major earthquake.",

    "story": [
      "Finding and fighting the militants who have become the beating heart of the Islamic State (IS) group in Africa can be tough work as they hide deep in the mountains of north-eastern Somalia.",
      "But in typical Donald Trump style, after the new US president ordered an airstrike on the area last weekend, he posted on social media: \"WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!\"",
      "Trump said the hit, less than two weeks into his term, had targeted a senior IS attack planner and other militants in Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland and had \"destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians\".",
      "He boasted that he had succeeded where former US President Joe Biden had failed.",
      "\"Biden and his cronies wouldn't act quickly enough to get the job done. I did!\"",
      "The fact that Somalia was the target of America's first major military operation under the new administration surprised many in the country who feared the US was planning to abandon them.",
      "In his first term, Trump withdrew about 700 American troops, a decision reversed by his successor.",
      "The $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal the Somalia government recently signed with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, is an indication of how worried it is.",
      "Under Biden, US troops in Somalia were carrying out special operations, training an elite Somali force and conducting regular airstrikes.",
      "A day before the airstrike, the Washington Post published an interview with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in which he pleaded for the US \"not to pull out the American advisers and consultants who are supporting the training of our special forces\".",
      "A post on X from his office after the strike also had a touch of desperation about it, acknowledging \"the unwavering support of the United States in the fight against international terrorism\" and welcoming \"the continued commitment under the decisive leadership of President Donald Trump\".",
      "But airstrikes are different from troops on the ground and Trump did not stop aerial bombardments in his first term. In fact, he increased them to nearly 400.",
      "\"The strike does not mean that the US government is going to step up its military engagement in Somalia,\" says Matt Bryden, the strategic adviser of Nairobi-based Sahan Research.",
      "\"Several American officials expected to assume leadership positions on African affairs no longer perceive Somalia's federal government to be a credible partner and are deeply critical of the high levels of security assistance provided in recent years to very little appreciable effect.\"",
      "Puntland's counter-terrorism approach is different from that of the national Somali government, with which it cut ties in March last year.",
      "It is more self-reliant and not as heavily dependent on support from African Union troops - of which around 12,000 are on the ground - and global powers including the US and Turkey.",
      "As Mohamed Mubarak, head of Puntland's security co-ordination office, points out it is troops from the north-east that have been battling IS for years with little help or thanks from others.",
      "\"It is not fair to put the airstrike front and centre while we have been fighting and dying on the ground,\" Mr Mubarak says.",
      "\"Regardless of what the rest of the world is doing, we are fighting IS, which is an international problem,\" he says.",
      "\"We have not seen much support except from Kenya, Ethiopia and the UAE. We don't know if the Americans will conduct more than one airstrike.\"",
      "Puntland says its forces have captured 48 caves and IS outposts - and destroyed dozens of drones and explosive devices - since launching its full-scale \"hilaac\" or \"lightning\" offensive last year.",
      "Although IS has been active in Somalia for about a decade, it has posed less of a threat than the Islamist group al-Shabab, which controls large parts of the country and has been described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "However, in recent times, IS has become more significant - locally, regionally and internationally.",
      "The authorities in Puntland and unnamed US officials say IS-Somalia's leader, the orange-bearded, bespectacled Abdulqadir Mumin, is now the global head of IS.",
      "Initial reports suggested he had been killed in a US airstrike last May but have never been confirmed.",
      "Whether or not Mumin is the head of IS or is alive or dead, IS-Somalia has become increasingly worrying for foreign states.",
      "As Trump said: \"These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our allies.\"",
      "According to Tricia Bacon, director of the policy anti-terrorism hub at American University in Washington DC, \"IS-Somalia has taken on more responsibilities within the Islamic State network, particularly in Africa but beyond the continent as well\".",
      "With branches of IS operating across the continent, from Mozambique to Mali, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Nigeria, IS-Somalia serves as a crucial nerve centre.",
      "Ms Bacon warns that IS-Somalia is looking beyond Africa too.",
      "\"It is positioned to facilitate and contribute to IS attacks in the West, including the United States. It also seeks to inspire attacks in the West,\" she says.",
      "\"International partners should provide more support to Puntland's ongoing efforts against the group.\"",
      "Mr Bryden says collusion with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels across the Red Sea in Yemen is also an issue.",
      "\"Like al-Shabab, IS-Somalia has received arms and training from the Houthis in Yemen, which is a source of concern for the US government and its allies,\" he says.",
      "A growing number of foreign fighters are joining the group, enhancing its strength in terms of numbers and expertise.",
      "A major source of IS-Somalia recruits are thought to be Ethiopian migrants, who gather in Puntland's port city of Bosaso in the hope of a sea crossing to a better life abroad.",
      "IS offers them better pay than they would earn in the Gulf states and experts say that some of the group's senior commanders are Ethiopian.",
      "\"We assess that IS-Somalia is 80% or more foreign fighters, mostly from North Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania and the Middle East, in that order,\" says Mr Mubarak.",
      "He estimates the group is about 1,000-strong; UN monitors put it at around 600 to 700.",
      "Last October, the head of the US Africa Command, Michael Langley, said he thought IS had grown in northern Somalia by about \"two-fold\" in a year.",
      "The group staged one of its most sophisticated ever attacks in December, hitting a military base in Puntland's Bari region.",
      "The group released a statement saying not a single Somali was involved. The 12 attackers came from seven countries - Tanzania, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Ethiopia.",
      "The movement has also become more effective at raising money.",
      "The US, UN and Somalia experts say a key part of IS's financial infrastructure - the al-Karrar office - is based in Puntland, disbursing funds and expertise to other branches of the group in Africa and beyond.",
      "The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said IS-Somalia had raised nearly $2m in the first half of 2022 by taxing local businesses, imports, nomads and farmers.",
      "If Puntland's forces are to succeed in driving out the militants, air support will prove invaluable.",
      "Shortly after the US strike, Puntland police said the head of IS-Somalia's assassination squad, Abdirahman Shirwa Aw-Said, had surrendered.",
      "But experts say such strikes will need to be consistent to hunt down existing IS cells in Somalia and stop others mushrooming.",
      "It is unclear whether the US and its unpredictable leader have the appetite to keep bombing Somalia's north-eastern mountains.",

      "For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.",
      "Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.",
      "The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.",
      "It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.",
      "In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.",
      "\"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,\" Yuval told the BBC.",
      "\"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now.\"",
      "Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.",
      "Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against \"illegal construction\", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.",
      "Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.",
      "On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.",
      "More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.",
      "In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence \u2013 the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.",
      "Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.",
      "Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a \"title deed\" to the West Bank and \"there's no such thing\" as occupation or settlements.",
      "When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.",
      "The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.",
      "According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the \"expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert\".",
      "Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.",
      "Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.",
      "A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: \"We have no other land.\"",
      "The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: \"You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day.\"",
      "The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present.",
      "While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures.",
      "In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, \"I feel this huge depression.\"",
      "The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: \"How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?\"",
      "Yuval told the BBC he felt \"responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community\" because \"at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money\".",
      "Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a \"situation of apartheid\" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against \"genocide\" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide.",
      "German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were \"shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel\", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an \"intolerable relativisation\" and that \"antisemitism has no place in Berlin\".",
      "Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic.",
      "Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was \"very angry\" at the label, which was \"emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing\".",
      "He said it was \"absurd\" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history \"should tell us to fight against dehumanisation\u2026 no matter who is the victim\".",
      "Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there \u2013 rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar.",
      "One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment.",
      "Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have \"unlimited power\" and there is a \"daily level of harassment\".",
      "He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment.",
      "The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would \"truly be a deterrent\".",
      "A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary \"has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion\".",
      "\"We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,\" the statement read.",
      "Yuval said: \"I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination.",
      "\"It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long.\"",
      "In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village \u2013 after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there.",

    "story": [
      "\"I have so much money now that I could hire someone to kill you, and nobody would know. No-one would miss you. No-one would know anything.\"",
      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

      "\"Every second HIV-positive person in Ukraine was identified thanks to this programme,\" Mr Sherembey adds.",
      "But the future of USAID (the United States Agency for International Development) is now very uncertain.",
      "One of US President Donald Trump's first actions after returning to office was signing an executive order pausing almost all foreign assistance for 90 days while a review could be carried out. He has said USAID is run by \"radical left lunatics\" and is getting away with \"tremendous fraud\" - without giving evidence.",
      "Mr Sherembey, who heads 100% Life, the largest patient-led organisation in Ukraine, recalls that when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, warehouses storing HIV medication were bombed.",
      "It was USAID assistance that made it possible to quickly procure replacement medication and distribute it across the country, he explains.",
      "\"USAID's slogan is that this is assistance from the American people. But it turns out that this aid could be stopped by the decision of one person,\" he says.",
      "USAID was established in 1961 by President John F Kennedy. It has around 10,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40bn (\u00a332.25bn), out of a total of $68bn in US government foreign aid spending.",
      "It has bases in more than 60 countries, and works in dozens of others. However, most of the work on the ground is carried out by other organisations that it contracts and funds.",

      "A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there says more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused.",
      "\"The future appears bleak and the impact on patients is massive,\" he says.",

      "\"If an opposition figure, a university student, or a women's rights activist is arrested in Iran, it is NGOs like the one I work for that immediately act so the person's email and social media accounts are locked and removed,\" says the activist, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",
      "This has meant that if Iranian intelligence agents force detainees to reveal their passwords, they cannot access that person's communications, the activist says.",

But he soon became the president's biggest booster, contributing $288m to Trump and other Republican candidates and becoming a key adviser on the campaign.",

      "\"He's only concerned with the objective at hand. I think he views interpersonal issues and conflicts as ancillary things that are not worth his time,\" he said.",
      "Occasionally, Musk tended toward the impulsive. The manager recalled seeing Musk fire a fellow Tesla employee on the spot over an overflowing rubbish can.",
      "\"He interpreted that as a sign that this person didn't take as much pride in his work as he should,\" he said. \"That was the nuance to it\u2026 but at the end of the day someone got fired because they admitted that their trash can was overflowing.\"",
      "The approach yielded a committed workforce, the employee said. If you were on board with Musk's mission, that single-minded focus was motivating, he said, and helped fuel regular 13 plus-hour days on the job.",

      "\"We heard three shots, one after the another, and panicked. My teacher shouted: 'shut the doors, lock them and hide,'\" she tells Sweden's TV4 News.",
      "Police have not formally named the attacker but he has been identified as Rickard Andersson, 35, by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT.",
      "The gunman was among 11 people who died in the attack in the central Swedish city of Orebro.",
      "Local media paint a picture of a recluse who lived locally and legally owned a weapon.",
      "Here's what we know so far.",
      "What were the suspect's motives?",
      "The suspect was unknown to police and they believe he acted alone.",
      "Officers said he had no links to gangs and is thought to have acted \"without any ideological motive\".",
      "They also do not believe the attack was motivated by terrorism.",
      "\"It's a changing situation. The information we gave earlier is still valid, but may change later,\" said local police chief Roberto Eid Forest.",

      "The broadcaster found he had no convictions to his name and had declared no income over the past few years.",
      "What do we know about the weapon?",
      "Police said the gunman had four legally-owned rifles, three of which were found at the site of the attack.",
      "According to Swedish Radio, the ongoing police investigation lists an automatic firearm as the weapon used.",

      "\"The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor,\" said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building.",

      "\"People were scared of the neighbourhood,\" he said.",
      "Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.",
      "But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in.",

      "Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York?",
      "\"Well, that is the intention,\" said Ms Swanepoel. \"Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa.\"",

    "summary": "The document charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is being 'unwrapped' using X-ray scans and AI.",
    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",

      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",

      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "\"I'm living a dream way beyond my own dream,\" Yusef said.",

      "Yusef got his big break after performing during a poetry open mic night at Chicago's iconic Green Mill Lounge, 4802 N. Broadway, over 30 years ago. He caught the attention of other artists and the media there.",

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

      "The tour announcement dropped ahead of the 2025 Grammy Awards, held Sunday in Los Angeles.",

      "\"I think sometimes genre is a codeword to keep us in our place as artists,\" Beyonc\u00e9 said Sunday night as she accepted the award for Best Country Album. \"I just want to encourage people to do what they're passionate about.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:48:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",

      "President Trump has selected Gerald Parker, a veterinarian and former top-ranking federal health official, to head the White House's pandemic office, two U.S. officials tell CBS News.",
      "Congress created the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of one of the lessons learned from the outbreak, the office was intended to formalize the so-called czar roles that had led efforts across the federal government to prepare and respond to pandemic threats.",
      "Parker was previously the associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University. \"One Health\" refers to the study of how health threats in animals and the environment are closely linked to human health concerns, including how dangerous viruses and bacteria often emerge in animals before spreading to humans.",
      "Spokespeople for the university and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "He has served under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, and was recently head of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity under the Biden administration. This office was charged with crafting recommendations for new rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens.",
      "Parker has worked for the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.",
      "\"I've not been a fan of every choice that Donald Trump has made. And I've been very critical of many of them. This one is a very good choice,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 response coordinator under President Biden.",
      "Jha said he had consulted with Parker many times, describing him as widely known within the public health community as \"deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.\"",
      "One of the first challenges Parker will have to tackle is the unprecedented spread of bird flu around the country.",
      "In recent months, variants of the virus have decimated the poultry and dairy industries, driven up egg prices and led to concerns about spillovers into humans, including one death in Louisiana.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the office was charged with coordinating the mammoth response operations at HHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has struggled to investigate and stomp out spread of the virus in farms.",
      "\"There are very few public health experts who have that breadth of knowledge around One Health and have dealt with animal health. And so, I think that is an advantage he has over many other people,\" said Jha.",
      "Other challenges loom on the immediate horizon, including the U.S. response to a new outbreak of an Ebola virus in Uganda that has faced delays due to the Trump administration's sweeping pauses on foreign aid and shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions.",
      "Parker's selection for the role suggests that President Trump is not planning to do away entirely with the office, a possibility he had raised during his campaign.",
      "Some Trump advisers had suggested that the office might be reorganized into the National Security Council, instead of operating as a standalone team.",
      "One current health official voiced concern over whether Parker's team would be adequately staffed for the breadth of work awaiting him, as he starts at the White House this week.",
      "\"I do know that by picking Gerry Parker, I think at least the Trump White House is signaling they're going to take biological threats seriously and they're going to have a serious person at the helm,\" said Jha.",

      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model. Manufactured in Mexico and Korea by LG Electronics Inc. of Korea, the ranges were imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.",
      "Model and serial numbers involved in the recall can be found here.",
      "Owners of the recalled ranges should contact LG for a free warning label and placement instructions. The label reminds consumers to use the lock out/control lock function on the range panel to disable activation of the heating elements when not in use.",
      "\"Keep children and pets away\"",
      "\"Consumers are cautioned to keep children and pets away from the knobs, to check the range knobs to ensure they are off before leaving home or going to bed, and not to leave objects on the range when the range is not in use,\" the recall notice stated.",

      "The issue seemingly extends beyond one brand, as evidenced by Samsung's summertime recall of more than 1.1 million ranges sold nationwide after about 250 fires injured dozens and killed at least seven pets.",
      "According to the agency, CPSC was \"aware of incidents where houses burned, and people died from house fires started by range knobs accidentally turned on whether from people bumping into the knobs or pets activating the range. The issues affect both gas and electric ranges,\" the federal agency stated in a\u00a0summary\u00a0of a June 27 working group meeting.",
      "Between 2018 and May 30, 2024, CPSC data shows there were 338 incidents involving a range or cooktop accidentally being activated, involving 10 manufacturers. Two of those incidents led to fatalities, while 31 resulted in nonfatal injuries, according to the agency.",
      "\"Additionally, CPSC staff have found two other fatal incidents where a range was accidentally turned on when a knob was bumped, but the manufacturer is unknown.\"",

    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",

      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",

But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 16:36:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed 25% U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico could lead to a sharp increase in vehicle prices, auto industry executives and analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico could lead to higher domestic vehicle prices and dent profit margins for automakers, according to industry analysts.",
      "The average $25,000 price of a car imported from Mexico or Canada could jump $6,250 if the tariffs take effect, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility. The automotive research firm forecasts that importers would likely pass most of any increase in their costs along to consumers.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "\"The automotive industry is at a critical juncture,\" Michael Robinet, vice president of forecasting at S&P Global Mobility said in a statement. \"The proposed tariffs could not only inflate vehicle prices but also disrupt production schedules, with estimates suggesting a potential 30% decrease in production for high-exposure vehicles once tariffs are enacted, even if only for the short-term.\"",
      "After President Trump on Feb. 1 signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese goods, the White House on Monday suspended those plans for the U.S.' North American neighbors for at least a month to conduct negotiations.",
      "Whether those talks will yield a breakthrough is uncertain. But in response to pressure from Mr. Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have pledged to step up efforts to combat the flow of illicit drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration sees tariffs as a way to exact better terms with U.S. trading partners as well as to leverage other policy gains. In a Feb. 2 post on social media, Mr. Trump acknowledged a new wave of tariffs could cause\u00a0\"some pain\" for Americans, but said his broader vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "Impact on automakers",
      "While the 25% levies\u00a0on Canada and Mexico have been paused, auto manufacturers are bracing for impact.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said the company is positioned to manage \"a few weeks of tariffs.\" But a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth, he said.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Farley said Ford has enough inventory, including parts, to endure a couple of weeks of tariffs without having to ship car components across the U.S.'s southern and northern borders. Over the long-term, however, the company would have to \"make some major strategy shifts,\" he said, including building new plants in the U.S. to circumvent the taxes.",
      "Mr. Trump has said higher tariffs would spur both U.S. and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S. Most economists express skepticism that a higher tariff regime would lead to such a boom, saying most costs would trickle down to American consumers.",
      "General Motors CEO Mary Barra last week also alluded to the effects tariffs could have on its business, saying the company is considering restructuring its supply chain to cushion the blow from tariffs.",
      "\"We're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull,\" Barra said in an earnings call.",
      "Aptiv, which makes car parts, including vehicle software, hardware and electrical/electronic architecture, has also recently cautioned that potential tariffs could hurt its supply chain.",
      "\"Very intertwined\" economies",
      "Roughly 3.6 million light vehicles were imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico in 2024, accounting for 22% of all car sales nationwide, according to S&P Global Mobility. Mexico is the largest source of U.S. light vehicle imports, representing about 15% of sales.",
      "\"The tariffs would really hit the automobile industry hard because the motor vehicle industries of the U.S., Mexico and Canada are very intertwined,\" Marcus Noland, trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Parts will cross the border seven to eight times before final assembly, and the tariffs are applied every time a part crosses \u2014 so costs would go up very quickly.\"",
      "Manufacturers could reshore some production to the U.S. to avoid the levies, he said, but that would take time and require investing in new manufacturing facilities and labor.",
      "\"The amount of disruption this would cause cannot be overstated,\" Nolan said, adding that the tariffs would also \"tank\" the Mexican economy given how dependent it is on automobile exports to the U.S.",
      "\"If they start going belly up, you'll have unemployed people along the U.S. border, and the ironic thing is one of the reasons for this action was illegal migration, and it could actually incentivize illegal migration. By damaging the Mexican economy, you would probably increase the levels of illegal migration,\" he added.",
      "Reshoring challenges",
      "Automakers are mulling actions to offset possible cost increases, according to manufacturing executives and supply chain experts. But ramping up domestic production presents major challenges, analysts note.",
      "Reshoring production would drive up manufacturing costs due to higher labor expenses, and could contribute to an existing labor shortage, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Duncan Angove, CEO of digital supply-chain company Blue Yonder, told CBS MoneyWatch he expects U.S. automakers to double down on investing in automation and artificial intelligence to cut down on production costs, noting that the tariffs will either reduce companies' profit margins or result in higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Even before, there was a lot of investment pouring into new technology and automation,\" he said. \"But because they realize they can't pass the whole tariff increase along to the consumer, they are making these investments to reduce costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, if new car prices rise, more U.S. consumers would likely turn to the used car market, which would drive up prices of second-hand vehicles, he added.",
      "\"Bonanza\" for foreign competitors",
      "On Ford's earnings call Wednesday, Farley said U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico would not only hurt American automakers, but also benefit foreign competitors not subject to higher import duties, such as Korea's Hyundai and Japan's Honda and Toyota.",
      "\"If we're going to have a tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it's going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,\" Farley said. \"We can't just cherry-pick one place or the other, because this is a bonanza for our import competitors.\"",
      "Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CBS MoneyWatch that prolonged tariffs would result in the U.S. \"hurting American companies and helping Korean and Japanese companies.\"",
      "Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba in the Oval Office Friday, however, Mr. Trump said tariffs on Japan remain on the table if the U.S.' trade imbalance with Tokyo isn't reduced.",
      "\"We're going to work that out, I think very quickly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't think it will be any problem,\" he said. \"They want fairness also.\"",
      "James Picariello, senior automotive analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, noted that the elimination of discounts and deals stateside could eat into domestic vehicle sales.",
      "\"If automakers have to unwind all discounting and raise prices to sell vehicles, then we are talking about volume declines and major affordability problems for the auto industry,\" added",
      "However, Picariello also thinks the tariffs could bring up to a quarter of their vehicle production back to the U.S. An increase of that size wouldn't require manufacturers to build new plants, he said, given that on average U.S. car makers are currently only producing at about 55% capacity domestically.",
      "\"You can get 1 million units reshored within a reasonable scenario, and the Trump administration can declare a win of some kind. Moving a million units back to the U.S. sounds like a big enough number for the administration to advertise,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",

      "Employers around the U.S. added 143,000 jobs in January, as the labor market showed signs of cooling at the start of 2025.",
      "The numbers",
      "Hiring was weaker than expected by economists, who had forecast that the economy had added 170,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the nation's unemployment rate edged down to 4%, versus 4.1% in December.",
      "The unemployment rate had been forecast to remain at 4.1% in January, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The January employment figures show a slowdown in hiring from December, when employers added 307,000 new jobs. Still, the 143,000 new jobs in January are not far off from the average monthly gain of 166,000 in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Employers in the health care, retail and social assistance industries added new hires last month, although employment declined in mining, quarrying and the oil and gas extraction industries, the BLS said on Friday.",
      "Although the latest data indicates the labor market remains solid \u2014 albeit growing at a slower pace than in December \u2014 it also means borrowing costs for consumers and businesses are likely to stay higher longer. The Federal Reserve wants to see more progress on getting inflation down to its goal of a 2% annual rate before it makes additional rate cuts.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping\u00a0order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",

      "Saving the planet is so 2024. Clean energy leaders across the globe are now tailoring their messages to emphasize the greener side of green: wealth-building. It's an idea that sells far better in the new world of nationalism and tycoon leaders.",
      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",
      "But a sharper emphasis on profit potential has become evident as President Donald Trump stormed into office with a flurry of rollbacks to clean energy initiatives and an emphatic declaration of plans to \"unleash\" oil, gas and mining. In a lobbying blitz in Washington this week, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a \"robust American energy and manufacturing economy\" and sported lapel pins that said \"American energy dominance\" \u2014 a favorite Trump phrase.",
      "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene",
      "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene",
      "Meanwhile, in a major policy speech Thursday in Brazil, the U.N.'s top climate official played up the $2 trillion flowing into clean-energy projects and recalled a friend telling him that appealing to people's \"better angels\" only goes so far.",
      "That friend, according to U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: \"In the great horserace of life ... 'always back self-interest ... what's in it for me.' \"",
      "It's not that clean energy backers haven't made the case before. But a different landscape, especially in the U.S., stands to make it more potent.",
      "\"It's a very winning message for outreach to conservatives because it's really true,\" said former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. \"If we play your cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.\"",
      "Inglis pointed to Elon Musk's empire-building on electric cars, solar panels and batteries.",
      "\"When right-of-center people hear, 'you know, you can you make a profit at this' then it makes sense. Otherwise, it's like, why are people giving stuff away?\" Inglis said.",
      "Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there's a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word \u2014 and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it \"unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.\"",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, \"if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?\"",
      "In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings this week, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.",
      "The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.",
      "\"In the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,\" Stolark said. \"The messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.",
      "\"I think you want to meet an audience where they are, what's important to them, what's going to drive the conversation forward.\"",
      "Liz Beardsley, senior policy counsel at the U.S. Green Building Council that was part of the sweeping lobbying effort, said the economy has always been a core component of its messages, and that \"doing good is also good for business.\"",
      "To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.",
      "\"The honesty and coherence of the business and financial sectors in making the economic case for the transition is refreshing, at least, after years of doublespeak, greenwashing and confusion,\" Sachs said. \"It's not a perfect strategy from a climate or social perspective, as the private sector cannot on its own fully decarbonize the economy ... But under this administration, it's probably our best bet for progress.\"",
      "President Trump may not be reachable, but his Energy and Interior secretaries are and they have power, said Frank Maisano, a longtime Washington spokesman for energy interests from oil and gas to wind and batteries.",

    "title": "Federal workers get delay in resignation deadline \u2014 here's what to know",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court temporarily paused the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, while unions claim it is against the law.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of federal workers have more time to ponder their next career move after a judge on Thursday temporarily suspended the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for them to accept or reject the agency's\u00a0\"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "The cutoff to take the deal had been set to expire on Thursday at midnight Eastern time before the ruling from U.S. District Judge George O'Toole barred the OPM from implementing the deadline. A Justice Department lawyer said the agency, which sent the original offer, would notify government employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.",
      "\"In compliance with the court order, the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation program is being extended to Monday, Feb. 10, at 11:59 p.m. EST,\" the OPM said in a social media post. \"The program is NOT being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer.\"",
      "Under the OPM's offer, employees who accepted it would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for workers. But if they opted to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of 2.3 million civilian federal employees, is a fraught one, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. In part, that's because the offer includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security,\u00a0according\u00a0to the OPM.",
      "Through Feb. 5, about 40,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter.",
      "\"We encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday around the time of Judge O'Toole's ruling. \"They don't want to come into the office. If they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly qualified people\" to replace them.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, legal sources and union officials said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general around the country have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

Like in previous years, those who do show up for the game will have paid a high price to be there.",
      "From the cheapest seats to the most expensive, spots spectators can reserve at Caesars Superdome, here's a look at how much Super Bowl tickets cost this year.",
      "How much do the cheapest Super Bowl tickets cost for 2025?",
      "As of Feb. 6, the cheapest Super Bowl seats are on the Superdome terrace, which is the stadium's upper level, in the 20th row. Those tickets cost $3,000 each on\u00a0Ticketmaster, although some seats nearby were priced as high as $4,982. Similarly located seats were going for at least $2,920 each on StubHub, with a handful of tickets remaining at that general price point.",
      "Additional tickets were still free to purchase from the online marketplaces that advertise original event passes from Super Bowl organizers as well as resale tickets. The affordable ones, relative to floor seating, were generally scattered along the terrace, with prices ranging from that $2,920 low to nearly $5,000 depending on the seller and their location.",
      "Ticket packages sold directly by the NFL start at roughly $6,700 per person and include amenities along with the seat, like access to tailgate parties, meet-and-greets with football stars, and free food and drinks.",
      "How much is the average Super Bowl ticket price for 2025?",
      "The average price of a Super Bowl ticket was $8,076 in the final weeks leading up to this year's game, CBS Sports reported, citing StubHub.",
      "How much are the most expensive Super Bowl tickets for 2025?",
      "The priciest tickets currently up for grabs are on the ground level, near the Chiefs' area on the field. Seats in that section cost around $8,650 on StubHub, with comparable seats costing up to $12,000 on Ticketmaster.\u00a0 Those prices were down from the previous week, when prime viewing could cost interested patrons between $14,414 and $$22,663 on StubHub, and up to $18,800 on Ticketmaster for the same seats.",
      "How does the cost of a 2025 Super Bowl ticket compare to previous years?",
      "Although StubHub said it's seeing record demand for Super Bowl tickets in 2025, with sales up 10% from the same time last year, the company's average price for a seat at the game is down 14% since 2024, according to CBS Sports.",

      "In addition to imposing a 10% levy on Chinese imports, Mr. Trump's executive order also suspended a little-known customs exemption that allowed goods of de minimis value \u2014 items worth less than $800 \u2014 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order throws a wrench in the business models of China-based retailers like Shein and Temu, which were previously exempt from any tariffs and customs inspections thanks to the de minimis loophole.",

      "The de minimis exemption helped the Chinese e-commerce giants keep their costs low, and appeal to predominately young American consumers with contemporary styles at incredibly low prices. The companies ship directly to consumers, allowing them to compete with domestic players including Amazon, which launched its own answer to Temu and Shein last year, called Amazon Haul. Available strictly on the Amazon app, Amazon Haul features goods shipped from China that cost less than $10 and sells items that resemble those sold by Shein and Temu.",

    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers. \"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Richard Escobedo and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 14:17:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "summary": "Court rules Metropolitan AME Church owns Proud Boys' trademark after the group fails to pay $2.8 million judgment.",
    "story": [
      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",
      "\"This is our time to stand up, to be very clear to the Proud Boys and their ilk that we came here fighting, that we have never ever capitulated to the violent whims of white supremacist groups,\" Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan AME Church, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they thought we would be afraid, they were wrong. There are many people with us and who stand with us.\"",
      "The Metropolitan AME Church, which was founded in 1838 and has hosted speakers including Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt, can now collect funds from sales of Proud Boys merchandise as well as its membership dues, people familiar with the case said. The church can also block the Proud Boys from using the trademark, they said.",
      "The notoriety of the Proud Boys' name likely helped the group in recruitment, which means blocking use of its trademark could both hurt the group's ability to sell merchandise and recruit new members, they added.",
      "\"From our point of view, it's fitting that the money the Proud Boys raised in sales and dues will go to fund the good work of the Metropolitan AME,\" Kaitlin Banner, who represented the church in the case and serves as deputy legal director at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, told CBS.",

      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",

The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",
      "\"The study is completed and was to be published in MMWR last month until the order from the new administration halted communication from CDC,\" K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said in an email.",
      "The association had worked with Ohio's health department and the CDC to sample\u00a0the blood of veterinarians who treat cows at an annual conference late last year, looking for antibodies that would help answer an outstanding question: had bird flu cases infected veterinarians under the radar?",

    "summary": "The wealthiest man in the world is in charge of a powerful new government task force fundamentally changing the government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u2014Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, whose companies have contracts with and interest in the federal government while Musk and his team overhaul the size and scope of government, won't be filing a publicly available financial disclosure report.",
      "Instead, Musk's required financial disclosure as a designated special government employee will be confidential, a White House official said on the condition of anonymity. Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency task force have been making sweeping changes and forcing cuts at government agencies one by one \u2014 to praise from President Trump's supporters and protest from others.",
      "\"As an unpaid special government employee who is not a commissioned officer, Elon will file a confidential financial disclosure report,\" the White House official said. \"He was also provided an ethics briefing this week and other DOGE staff will/have received the same treatment.\"",
      "The highest-level government officials, including Cabinet nominees, top White House officials and so-designated special government employees are required by the Ethics in Government Act to file financial disclosures and oftentimes, ethics agreements, documents meant to shed light on any potential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of them.",
      "Filers are required to disclose all significant assets, including investments like mutual funds and stocks, as well as income and debt, and foreign investments. The financial disclosure for FBI director nominee Kash Patel, for instance, revealed he was consulting for the Embassy of Qatar as recently as November, the same month Mr. Trump tapped him to head up the FBI.",
      "Special government employees \u2014 the designation the Trump administration has given Musk as a temporary employee \u2014 must file a financial disclosure as long as they work for the federal government for at least 60 days. According to the Office of Government Ethics, which keeps records of these filings and offers guidance to filers, special government employees that are \"paid under a system other than the general schedule\" and \"have a rate of basic pay equal to or greater than 120% of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15\" are required to file public disclosures, giving the administration a possible but murky loophole, since Musk isn't accepting a government salary.",
      "Musk's businesses include SpaceX, Tesla, X, formerly known as Twitter, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, some of which do business with foreign countries. Tesla, for instance, does business in China. Musk's net worth is just shy of $400 billion as of this month, according to Forbes.",
      "That Musk's financial interests won't be disclosed is a concern, good government nonprofits say, because it's hard to discern whether any actions he takes or promotes benefit him personally.",
      "\"While filing a confidential disclosure may be correct legally, it is not what is appropriate here. With the level of influence over the federal government that Musk appears to have, the American public has a right to know what his business interests and potential conflicts of interest are,\" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. \"He has spoken in the past of a need for a more transparent government. We agree. This isn't that.\"",
      "In December, Musk took to his platform, X, to say he doesn't believe Americans should have to file Freedom of Information Act requests because such information should already be public.",
      "\"There should be no need for FOIA requests,\" Musk wrote. \"All government data should be default public for maximum transparency.\"",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said it's \"concerning that the White House isn't saying we have nothing to hide and Musk's financial disclosure report will be released.\"",
      "\"The public and agencies deserve a full understanding of Musk's financial interests in order to prevent conflicts when he storms into agencies,\" Amey said. \"Just because he is unpaid does not mean he won't have significant influence in this administration, and be involved in decisions that touch on his personal and private interests, including federal contracts and regulatory issues.\"",
      "The White House official who confirmed Musk's financial disclosure will be confidential also said Musk has a \"TS\" clearance, meaning top secret, the highest level of access to information apart from \"TS/SCI,\" which means top clearance for sensitive compartmentalized information.",
      "In a press conference Friday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump why DOGE needs access to Americans' personal information, like bank accounts and Social Security numbers. Consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about DOGE gaining access to the Treasury Department's payment system, and taxpayers' Social Security numbers.",
      "\"Well it doesn't, but they get it very easily, I mean we don't have very good security in our country,\" the president responded.",
      "A reporter in the Oval Office also asked Mr. Trump if he will put Musk on the podium for the media to ask him questions directly.",

    "story": [
      "Ellen Weintraub, the current Federal Election Commission Chair and one of three Democratic members on the committee,\u00a0posted a letter\u00a0on X Thursday night from President Trump that says she has been removed as an FEC member.",
      "The brief letter, dated January 31, 2025, reads, \"You are hereby removed as a Member of the Federal Election Commission.\"",
      "On Thursday night, Weintraub alleged her firing was not legal.",
      "\"There's a legal way to replace FEC commissioners-this isn't it,\" she wrote in her\u00a0social media post. \"I've been lucky to serve the American people & stir up some good trouble along the way. That's not changing anytime soon.\"",
      "The White House has not yet responded for comment on Weintraub's post or firing.",
      "The FEC is charged with enforcing campaign finance laws and overseeing federal elections. It has an unusual composition \u2014 the commission can be composed of no more than three Republicans and three Democrats. A majority of commissioners must agree to any action, and the even partisan division on the commission frequently leads to gridlock on matters of significance. There's currently one vacant Republican position.",
      "Weintraub's six-year term expired in April 2007, but according to FEC rules, that didn't mean she had to leave the commission.",
      "\"Commissioners serving expired terms may choose to remain until they are replaced,\" FEC rules state. The president appoints FEC commissioners, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. However, there is no written provision or language that limits if a president can replace an FEC commissioner before a replacement is appointed.",
      "Weintraub told CBS News that access to her FEC email, computer and cellphone stopped on Friday. She is now listed as a past commissioner on the FEC website.",
      "She said she received the letter, dated Jan. 31, 2025, in an email on Thursday from the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel. Weintraub wasn't aware of whether her fellow Democratic commissioners received a similar letter.",
      "She said she is still mulling over her options on what to do next, and whether or not to file litigation.",
      "\"This is unprecedented. It wasn't contemplated. The statute has a clearly laid out task for replacing commissioners and this wasn't it,\" she told CBS News. \"There has never been a firing. There is nothing in the statute, in the Federal Election Campaign act that authorizes a firing.\"",
      "\"It raises concerns about political actors interfering with the operations of the agency that is supposed to be regulating political actors,\" she added.",
      "The Campaign Legal Center, a legal nonprofit group that deals with voting issues, campaign finance and ethics,\u00a0released a statement\u00a0calling the president's firing of Weintraub illegal.",
      "Trevor Potter, its president and the Republican former chair of the FEC, says Trump's move to fire her without a Senate-confirmed replacement is illegal.",
      "\"As the only agency that regulates the president, Congress intentionally did not grant the president the power to fire FEC commissioners,\" wrote Trevor Potter, the founder and president of the CLC and a Republican former chair of the FEC. \"Trump is free to nominate multiple new commissioners and to allow Congress to perform its constitutional role of advice and consent. It's contrary to law that he has instead opted to claim to 'fire' a single Democratic commissioner who has been an outspoken critic of the president's lawbreaking and of the FEC's failure to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Weintraub is not the only member of an independent commission to be be fired by Mr.\u00a0Trump. Last month the president fired\u00a0Gwynne Wilcox\u00a0from the National Labor Relations Board. On Wednesday, she filed a lawsuit over her dismissal. Her case could determine precedent for the president's use of executive power to remove officials in independent agencies. In an interview, she told CBS News, \"There [wasn't] any cause or any reason that I was actually terminated.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, Weintraub rejected his calls to \"delay the election until people can properly\" vote. He claimed there would be fraud in the 2020 election because of increased absentee voting amid the pandemic.",
      "\"No, Mr. President. No,\" she responded to his post. \"You don't have the power to move the election. Nor should it be moved. States and localities are asking you and Congress for funds so they can properly run the safe and secure elections all Americans want. Why don't you work on that?\"",
      "And on Jan. 6, 2021, during the Capitol riot, Weintraub addressed Mr. Trump on social media: \"No, Mr. President, the election was not stolen. You lost a free and fair election fair and square. Summon an iota of patriotism: Concede the election you have lost. Condemn the violence you have incited.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Friday that he will prevent the Trump administration from placing 2,200 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, on administrative leave, siding with unions representing the employees for now.",
      "Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who President Trump named to the bench in 2019, said in court that he would approve a limited temporary restraining order that would block the employees from being put on administrative leave, a move that was set to take effect at midnight. He also said he would decide whether the 500 workers who are already on leave would be reinstated. Details on the pause would be set in a forthcoming filing, he said.",
      "He said the unions \u2014 American Foreign Service Association and American Federation of Government Employees \u2014 established they would suffer \"irreparable harm\" without a pause, while the government did not. \"Frankly, there is zero harm to the government\" in a short-term pause, Nichols said from the bench.",
      "At a hearing Friday afternoon, the plaintiffs asked the court to immediately pause evacuation orders given to USAID personnel in international postings, and for access to be restored to computers systems for people who are in the field across all parts of USAID and its contractors.",
      "The government acknowledged that 2,200 USAID employees were set to be put on leave at midnight barring court action, not including the other 500 people who are already on leave prior to today. Six hundred and eleven essential personnel would stay on at USAID, and the government added that it has no plans to lower that number.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the major reduction in force, evacuations and uprooting people from their jobs and homes were violations of the separation of powers and congressional appropriations. They said families are being separated, and children of USAID employees are being pulled out of schools across the world. Staffers have been cut off from access to health care, and many have to go back to states without housing or source of income, according to the unions.",
      "\"This is the full-scale gutting of virtually all of the personnel at an agency,\" a lawyer for USAID employees said, adding it is \"carnage\" on ground for the USAID workforce and contractors.",
      "Nichols pressed the government's attorneys for a reason why Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is the acting head of USAID, needs to place the employees on leave Friday night. \"I don't believe Secretary Rubio needs to provide one,\" one of the lawyers responded.",
      "Nichols pushed the government lawyers to detail what \"findings\" they have that there is corruption and fraud in the agency, as is alleged by President Trump and his allies. The attorneys had no response. The judge also took issue with the government's framing of Rubio being able to control USAID in his role as secretary of state, not as acting administrator, given that it is a separate agency.",

      "During the news conference, which followed Mr. Trump's meeting with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the president praised Ishiba and had warm words for the U.S.-Japan relationship, but still indicated that Japan would be subject to new tariffs.",
      "\"We're going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said, and those would be announced early next week. \"Very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way nobody's hurt,\" he added, \"as opposed to a flat-fee tariff.\"",
      "The president also said that Nippon Steel's deal to buy U.S. Steel would be restructured as an investment, rather than an outright purchase.",
      "\"They've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel, as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting,\" the president said. \"And we're going to meet with Nissan next week, the head of Nissan, very great company, and they'll work out the details,\" Trump said (he appeared to have said \"Nissan,\" though Nippon is the name of the Japanese steel company.",
      "Ishiba said that Japanese technology would be provided, and that \"better quality products will be manufactured in the United States.\"",
      "The president also announced Japan would be taking in new shipments of American liquified natural gas or LNG \"in record numbers.\"",
      "In his opening remarks, the president said he's \"confident that the cherished alliances between our two countries and others also will continue to flourish long and into the future.\" He added, \"The military cooperation between the United States and Japan is one of our closest security partnerships, and it's one of the closest we have anywhere in the world.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two leaders spoke \"long and hard\" about their economic and trade relationship and noted Japan's outsized investments in the U.S. Mr. Trump said Japan will have some \"competition,\" because other countries are also eager to invest in the U.S.",
      "Ishiba, through a translator, said their discussion was \"frank\" and \"productive.\" The two leaders said they would issue a joint Japan-U.S. statement, which would serve as a compass. \"I look forward to working with President Trump, whom I respect immensely, to usher in a new golden age of Japan-U.S. relations,\" the Japanese leader said.",
      "Trump and Japanese prime minister discuss U.S. Steel, tariffs, automotive issues, national security",
      "Before the news conference, among the top issues to come up during Mr. Trump's meeting with the Japanese prime minister was Nippon Steel's deal to acquire U.S. Steel, despite former President Joe Biden's rejection of the merger and Mr. Trump's previous pledge to block the deal.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday he hadn't changed his mind on U.S. Steel, but multiple sources said earlier that he was considering allowing Nippon to complete its $14.1 billion acquisition. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that he and the Japanese prime minister would be discussing the U.S. steel deal.",
      "Mr. Trump met with the CEO of U.S. Steel, David Burritt, at the White House on Thursday. The Biden administration blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel last month. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have filed lawsuits over the Biden administration's decision to stop Nippon Steel from taking over its Pittsburgh-based rival company.",
      "\"The United States is proud of our long and close alliance with Japan, and it's time for a new age of U.S. Japan relations to bring peace and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a phone call. \"Our two nations will continue to work together to ensure we deter threats in the region through our full range of military capabilities.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's appearance with the Japanese prime minister is his second meeting and joint press conference with a foreign leader this week. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said the U.S. wants to take control of and \"own\" the Gaza Strip.",

It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good.

      "\"This is an important step in the right direction to protect those who protect us \u2014 FBI agents who have dedicated their careers to upholding the rule of law and defending our country,\" she said in a statement. \"This agreement provides critical safeguards, preventing immediate public exposure or retaliation and ensuring that FBI Agents can remain focused on protecting the American people. We appreciate the court's recognition of the serious concerns at stake.\"",

      "They were set to reconvene to continue the hearing Friday, but it was called off given the deal. The Justice Department and FBI agents agreed to file their briefs about a more permanent injunction later this month and into March, and Cobb set a hearing for March 27.",
      "Last week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to a Jan. 6 investigation \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News. In response, agents across the country were asked Sunday to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "Initially, the FBI handed over employee identification numbers and other identifying information for over 5,000 personnel who responded to the survey. However, sources confirmed to CBS News that Driscoll was later ordered to submit the actual names of the FBI employees who investigated Jan. 6 cases. In a message to FBI employees, Driscoll wrote he had complied with the orders and the names were sent via a classified system, sources said.",

Bove also revealed acting FBI leadership refused to comply with initial efforts to identify certain agents tied to the probes in what he called instances of \"insubordination.\"",
      "It remains unclear what personnel action, if any, Justice Department leaders might take based on the list of names. Lawyers for the FBI agents involved in the lawsuit have warned that the purpose of the list is to identify agents for \"adverse employment action\" as a result of their work on the Jan. 6 probes.",
      "Roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigation and prosecutions of Mr. Trump \u2014 which were dismissed after he was elected in November \u2014 were fired, sources confirmed to CBS News last month.

    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping\u00a0order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",

      "Saving the planet is so 2024. Clean energy leaders across the globe are now tailoring their messages to emphasize the greener side of green: wealth-building. It's an idea that sells far better in the new world of nationalism and tycoon leaders.",
      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",
      "But a sharper emphasis on profit potential has become evident as President Donald Trump stormed into office with a flurry of rollbacks to clean energy initiatives and an emphatic declaration of plans to \"unleash\" oil, gas and mining. In a lobbying blitz in Washington this week, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a \"robust American energy and manufacturing economy\" and sported lapel pins that said \"American energy dominance\" \u2014 a favorite Trump phrase.",

      "U.K. firm cracks the code to convert harmful methane emissions into useful hydrogen and graphene",
      "Meanwhile, in a major policy speech Thursday in Brazil, the U.N.'s top climate official played up the $2 trillion flowing into clean-energy projects and recalled a friend telling him that appealing to people's \"better angels\" only goes so far.",
      "That friend, according to U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: \"In the great horserace of life ... 'always back self-interest ... what's in it for me.' \"",
      "It's not that clean energy backers haven't made the case before. But a different landscape, especially in the U.S., stands to make it more potent.",
      "\"It's a very winning message for outreach to conservatives because it's really true,\" said former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. \"If we play your cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.\"",
      "Inglis pointed to Elon Musk's empire-building on electric cars, solar panels and batteries.",
      "\"When right-of-center people hear, 'you know, you can you make a profit at this' then it makes sense. Otherwise, it's like, why are people giving stuff away?\" Inglis said.",
      "Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there's a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word \u2014 and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it \"unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.\"",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, \"if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?\"",
      "In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings this week, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.",
      "The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.",
      "\"In the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,\" Stolark said. \"The messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.",
      "\"I think you want to meet an audience where they are, what's important to them, what's going to drive the conversation forward.\"",
      "Liz Beardsley, senior policy counsel at the U.S. Green Building Council that was part of the sweeping lobbying effort, said the economy has always been a core component of its messages, and that \"doing good is also good for business.\"",
      "To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 09:26:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Gwynne Wilcox is suing the president, arguing that he had no legal cause to fire her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Gwynne Wilcox, who is suing President Trump for ousting her from the National Labor Relations Board, said she was \"stunned\" when she received a letter from the White House late on Jan. 27 firing her.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "First appointed to the five-person board by President Joe Biden in 2021, Wilcox was confirmed by the Senate in December to serve a second term that was supposed to last through 2028. In the letter informing her of her removal, Mr. Trump said she had not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of [his] administration.\"",
      "By firing Wilcox, Mr. Trump left the board, which mediates labor disputes and protects workers rights, without enough members to function. And it's part of a string of actions Mr. Trump has taken in the first few weeks of his term against independent agencies whose leaders generally remain in place across administrations and have some legal protections.",
      "In response, Wilcox sued Mr. Trump on Wednesday, alleging that her firing\u00a0 was \"unprecedented and illegal.\" In the 90 years since Congress established the agency, no president has attempted to remove a member of the board, Wilcox said.",
      "\"The law is that board members cannot be removed from their position unless they've engaged in neglect or duty or malfeasance, Wilcox said. \"And based upon the letter I received, there was no claim of that. There [wasn't] any cause or any reason that I was actually terminated.\"",
      "Wilcox's lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asserts that her dismissal was a \"blatant violation\" of the National Labor Relations Act that protects board members from being fired by the president without cause.",
      "\"He does not have the authority to remove me based on my views,\" said Wilcox, a lawyer who prior to her position at NLRB represented labor unions.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the litigation. The administration has previously said Mr. Trump has the right to fire any executive branch employee that he wishes to, a claim that is also being contested in other lawsuits.",
      "Wilcox is asking a judge to declare her removal unlawful and reinstate her as a member of the board. In the filing, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump may try to use the litigation as a \"test case\" for the courts, suggesting that if her firing is upheld, it could set a precedent that would expand presidential power.\u00a0 But, at the same time, she says if she didn't take legal action, it would render the laws protecting the independence of agencies like hers meaningless.",
      "\"If I don't fight, that means the president gets to do whatever he wants to do in violation of the law,\" said Wilcox, who is the first black woman to serve on the board.",
      "Wilcox said her removal, which left the labor watchdog without a necessary quorum required by law, puts workers' rights at risk and takes away a resource to resolve labor disputes.",
      "Recently, the board took actions to protect the rights of workers at Amazon and SpaceX. She told CBS News that she will take the case to the Supreme Court \"if it's necessary.\"",
      "\"I feel very strongly about this case,\" she said. \"It's bigger than me.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump wrote Thursday that the Gaza Strip \"would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting.\"",
    "story": [
      "Some Michigan voters who either sat out the election, voted for a third-party candidate or voted for President Trump are now revisiting their decision after he proposed Tuesday that the United States \"take over\" the Gaza Strip, rebuild it and relocate Palestinians elsewhere.",
      "In the town of Dearborn, Michigan, which has the largest Muslim population per capita in the country, 43% voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris won 37% of the vote, substantially lower than the 68% former President Joe Biden won in 2020, according to the city's election data.",
      "Sarah Chabaan, a college senior in Dearborn who voted for Mr. Trump, said she was \"disappointed\" with his proposal but remained skeptical \"he would actually implement what he's saying.\"",
      "Asked if she regrets her vote, Chabaan said \"a little bit\" but pointed to Mr. Trump's involvement in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"Had I voted for Kamala, I think maybe the war might have still been going on. That's the unfortunate situation,\" Chabaan said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Gaza idea has been defended by White House officials, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was \"worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\" But the proposal was largely panned by Arab American and Muslim organizations in the U.S. Middle Eastern countries also rejected the premise.",
      "On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump wrote that the Gaza Strip \"would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting.\" He also stated that no U.S. troops would be involved, a sticking point for congressional Republicans. He has not revealed many more specifics about the idea, which prompted immediate criticism regarding the displacement of the Palestinians, the abandonment of a two-state solution and the idea that the U.S. would control Gaza.",
      "\"The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth,\" the president wrote. On Tuesday, he suggested it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Harris ended up with 15,000 fewer Dearborn voters than President Biden got four years earlier. That gap contributed to Harris' overall loss in the battleground state, where Trump won by 80,103 votes.",
      "Amer Zahr, who voted third-party for president but Democratic for other offices, said many in Dearborn don't believe Mr. Trump's proposal will actually happen, and said it's \"an outrageous idea posed by someone who doesn't know what he's talking about.\"",
      "But he pinned the blame on the Democratic Party and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for not doing more to win over disaffected Arab American and Muslim voters. He and other Michigan residents CBS News talked to brought up Mr. Trump's visit as a candidate to Dearborn, and the lack of a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Zahr suggested that while there's a \"difference in style\" between Biden and Mr. Trump on the Israel-Hamas war, they still share a \"blind support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Now, Democratic politicians and liberals are willing to stand up against it a little bit because it's not their guy anymore,\" he said. \"The real news story is that Democrats and liberals are able to reject the notion of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. I hope they keep doing it.\"",
      "Osami Siblani, the publisher of The Arab American News, who did not vote for any presidential candidate, said \"the vote for Trump was not really a vote for Trump.\"",
      "\"It was a vote against the Biden-Harris administration, because they could not stop the carnage from happening in Gaza,\" said Siblani. \"We did not endorse Trump. We did not endorse Harris. We actually recommended that our community not vote for the top of the ticket.\"",
      "Siblani also decried Mr. Trump's proposal to own the Gaza Strip as \"insane.\"",
      "\"The people whose homes were burnt in L.A. because of the fire, they're gonna just leave it? Or they're gonna rebuild it and live there? People do not leave their lands.\"",
      "Much of Gaza has been decimated by Israeli military strikes that began after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Over the past two weeks, about 200,000 displaced Palestinians returned to the northern part of the Gaza Strip after Israel authorized their movement as part of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.",
      "Zaynah Jadallah, a Palestinian American and director at the Council of American Islamic Relation's (CAIR) Michigan chapter, said it was \"very dehumanizing\" for Palestinians to hear Gaza referred to as \"a piece of property, or talking about it like an opportunity for a real estate or an investment when it's their land.\"",
      "Other Michigan Arab American and Palestinian leaders condemned Mr. Trump's proposal, too. Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, wrote that Trump's proposal \"is yet another chapter in the ongoing genocide.\"",
      "Dawud Walid, the executive director of the CAIR Michigan chapter, said \"any forced displacement of Palestinians in their land would be ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "\"Perhaps some people right now in our community are second guessing their vote for Trump,\" he added.",
      "One group that helped Mr. Trump in his voter outreach to the Arab American community, \"Arab Americans for Trump,\" changed its name Wednesday to \"Arab Americans for Peace\" as a result of Mr. Trump's proposal, according to the Associated Press.",

      "Last week, Trump allies at the Justice Department ordered the FBI to send a questionnaire nationwide to identify personnel who investigated Jan. 6 and make a list for leadership to review. The move came\u00a0after President Trump pardoned about 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants immediately after taking office.",
      "The FBI subsequently turned over a list of about 5,000 individuals, which included information such as employee ID numbers and titles.",
      "However, lawsuits\u00a0filed by two groups of anonymous FBI agents resulted in a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily blocking the Justice Department from disclosing information about those agents to any other federal entity or outside group until further arguments are heard in the case.",
      "\"We just have a lot of unknowns, and it feels like no one has our backs,\" said one of the agents on that list, who spoke to CBS News on Thursday on condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation from the Justice Department's new leadership.",
      "\"Personally, I've lost sleep over this,\" said the agent, who investigated multiple Jan. 6 cases.",
      "The agent said filling out the questionnaire was \"demoralizing,\" and that they were left feeling \"defeated.\"",
      "\"We all feel defeated, and for not, and really for nothing,\" the agent added.",
      "Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove issued the initial directive in a Jan. 31 memo. And in a follow-up letter to FBI employees Wednesday, Bove wrote that \"no FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to the January 6 investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties.\"",
      "But the scrutiny and storm cloud hovering over these FBI employees and their work on cases that yielded more than 1,000 guilty pleas and a 100% conviction rate in jury trials sends a chilling message, the agent warned.",
      "The agent also wondered whether fellow agents, moving forward, would be \"allowed to pick and choose\" their investigations based on what they feel \"comfortable\" with.",
      "When asked if the Trump administration's demand for the list might scare off agents from taking certain cases in the future, they responded, \"Absolutely.\"",
      "\"I mean, we're all humans,\" the agent said.",
      "Furthermore, agents who testified or signed their names to public court documents worry about retaliation from riot defendants or their sympathizers.",
      "\"It's almost as if these defendants that were all pardoned have been put on a pedestal of being more patriotic and more loyal to this country than the men and women who go out every single day, away from their families, and put their lives on the line,\" the agent said.",
      "The FBI Agents Association, which represents thousands of active and retired agents, said that an agent who was investigating the deadly midair collision near Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., was briefly pulled off that response to fill out the questionnaire, and then returned to the crash site.",

      "Data from USAspending.gov shows of the $8 million spent on payments for Politico products in 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Interior and Department of Energy each paid over $1 million in 2024.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily prevented the Justice Department from disclosing information about FBI agents who fear they will be targeted because of their work on cases involving President Trump and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ordered that the Justice Department may not disclose the list of FBI agents who worked on the investigations to anyone outside the department \u2014 which would include any other federal entity or outside group, as well as public disclosure \u2014 until she hears arguments Friday as to whether to issue a temporary restraining order sought by unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association in a pair of cases brought earlier this week.",
      "Cobb's decision comes after an hourslong hearing, during which the Justice Department and lawyers for the agents discussed an order governing the potential disclosure of names of FBI personnel who were involved in the Jan. 6 cases, which was compiled by the bureau and turned over to the Justice Department this week.",
      "She said in her order, \"The government has represented that the information at issue in this case has not been shared outside of the DOJ.\"",
      "The brief hold will remain in place until the two sides reconvene for the continuation of the hearing or reach an agreement on the terms of the order.",
      "Cobb, who sits on the federal district court in Washington and was nominated for her seat by former President Biden in 2021, said during the hearing that if the list of names was to be released overnight, FBI agents could face \"significant and immediate danger.\"",
      "The challenge stemmed from a memorandum issued by Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week that directed the FBI to provide lists of current and former personnel assigned at any time to investigations and prosecutions related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The department required the FBI to turn over the information by Tuesday, and the bureau complied with the deadline, the Justice Department said. FBI Acting Director Brian Driscoll said in a message to the bureau that the data it provided identified employees by their Unique Employee Identifier, current title, title at the time of the Jan. 6 investigation, the office where they are currently assigned, role in the investigation of prosecution and date of last activity related to the probes.",
      "Mr. Trump has nominated Kash Patel, a close ally of the president's, to lead the FBI, but the Senate has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "A lawyer representing the unnamed FBI agents and employees said that were it not for Driscoll turning over identification numbers, the government would have a list of the names of agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. The Justice Department also has information compiled through surveys sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 investigations, including the extent of their roles, she warned.",
      "\"We are one step away from those names getting released,\" the lawyer said, adding that it will be \"irreparable\" if they are disclosed.",
      "The lawyer said a chief concern is the names of the FBI personnel could be leaked to a third party or published by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Our argument is that the threat to national security is so extreme that we cannot risk letting it happen first and then trying to put it back together,\" she said.",
      "The lawyer noted that since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, billionaire Elon Musk, through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has made public the names of other government employees. She also said that some Jan. 6 defendants who were granted clemency by Mr. Trump have also suggested on social media that they would target FBI agents.",
      "Mark Zaid, who is representing some of the unnamed FBI employees, estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 whose information was turned over to the Justice Department.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer, Jeremy Simon, went back and forth with Cobb about the language of a potential court order that would temporarily bar the Justice Department from disclosing without notice the list of FBI agents tied to Jan. 6 cases to entities and people outside of the department.",
      "Asked whether any other government agency intends to release that information while the court considers a motion for a preliminary injunction, Simon said he was not in a position to make representations about agencies outside of the Justice Department.",
      "Simon also declined to definitively confirm the names hadn't been shared outside of the Justice Department, telling the judge that there has not been an \"official disclosure.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued in a court filing that it was seeking information about FBI employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases to start a review process in conjunction with Mr. Trump's executive order aimed at ending what he calls the weaponization of the federal government.",
      "Government lawyers argued in a court filing Thursday morning that they believed there should not be a temporary restraining order implemented because of \"speculation involving future predictions of potential harm\" \u2014 not actual harm in the eyes of the government \u2014 and the FBI agents' \"speculative\" belief that the list of agents may be leaked outside of the department.",
      "Bove, meanwhile, sought to assuage concerns that agents could be retaliated against in an email disseminated to the FBI on Wednesday, writing that \"no FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to the January 6 investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general, who served as a defense lawyer to Mr. Trump, wrote that \"the only individuals who should be concerned about the process initiated by my January 31, 2025, memo are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent, who blatantly defied orders from Department leadership, or who exercised discretion in weaponizing the FBI.\"",
      "In their request for a temporary restraining order, the FBI agents argued the Justice Department is planning to take \"adverse employment actions\" and make public the names and identities of those targeted. One group of seven FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association said the disclosure would harm them, their colleagues and families, \"all but guaranteeing they will face threats of physical harm and emotional harassment in violation of their First Amendment and Due Process rights.\"",
      "Lawyers for the FBI agents wrote in their request that the Justice Department is seeking to retaliate against them by making public their identities \"simply because those individuals honorably performed their duties in connection with sensitive law enforcement investigations.\"",
      "\"Such acts are unconscionable, dangerous to the American public and illegal under the U.S. Constitution and numerous federal laws,\" they wrote.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers said the agents' request is based on a \"speculation involving future predictions of potential harm related to the information provided.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs can point to nothing that suggests the government intends to make public the list in this case,\" they wrote in a filing. \"To the contrary, the department and FBI management have repeatedly stressed the purpose of the list is to conduct an internal review, not expose dedicated special agents to public insult or ridicule.\"",

      "Roughly 40,000 federal workers \u2014 or about 2% of the government workforce \u2014 have accepted the deal, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. But the White House expects that number to rise.",
      "Leavitt said in response to the order that the Trump administration is \"grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer.\"",
      "Days after OPM put forth its offer, a group of four unions that represent more than 800,000 federal employees sued the agency and its acting director, Charles Ezell, arguing the so-called Fork Directive, as the unions call it, violates federal law.",
      "\"If these employees leave or are forced out en masse, the country will suffer a dangerous one-two punch,\" the unions said in their complaint. \"First, the government will lose expertise in the complex fields and programs that Congress has, by statute, directed the Executive to faithfully implement. The government will have fewer qualified employees to execute the statutorily-required tasks that still remain. And second, when vacant positions become politicized, as this administration seeks to do, partisanship is elevated over ability and truth, to the detriment of agency missions and the American people.\"",
      "They noted that funding for federal agencies is set to expire March 14, and there is no appropriation in place from Congress to cover the salaries of government workers after that date.",
      "They asked the judge to block OPM from implementing the Feb. 6 deadline.",
      "The subject line of the OPM email is the same as a 2022 email that billionaire Elon Musk sent to employees of Twitter, the social media platform he purchased that year and renamed X. The White House has said Musk is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee\" leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, which President Trump established with the goal of cutting spending and restructuring federal agencies.",
      "The proposed buyout offered by the Trump administration has raised concerns from employment lawyers, as components of it are unclear and lack guarantees, several told CBS News. It's also not clear the Trump administration has the authority to create such a program, as the unions have alleged in their legal challenge.",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal employees against accepting what they said is a \"misleading\" offer to resign.",
      "The deferred resignation program is one of several initiatives undertaken Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that aims to slash the size of the federal government. The president ordered\u00a0millions of federal workers to return to the office full-time and directed agencies to end remote work arrangements.",
      "His administration has also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID,\u00a0placing nearly all of its staff on leave and ordering its overseas missions to shut down.",

    "summary": "Grassroots groups around the world have lost funding for a range of humanitarian projects, including medical aid and fighting human trafficking.",
    "story": [
      "Abdul Fatorma, chief executive of the Campaign for Human Rights and Development International, had been working on expanding democracy in Sierra Leone for seven years.",
      "Civil war had plagued the West African coastal nation for decades, ending in 2002 \u2014 and slowly, peace had returned, helping to reduce migration and violence. Essential to that progress, Sierra Leone's civil service advocates believe, is nurturing democracy and human rights. Fatorma's grassroots campaign was granted $1 million in U.S. funding in 2023 to continue work on those goals.",
      "Around two years later the project \u2014 which promoted meaningful participation of all citizens in their political systems, expanded the reach of civic education and encouraged female aspirants to run for office \u2014 ended last week when Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. Almost all of the agency's workers are being put on leave.",
      "\"It came as a shock, and devastating,\" said Fatorma\u00a0from his office in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. He added the loss created \"a gap\" in funding and a \"vacuum in governance\" that he said Russia or China could rush to fill.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget. A large portion of the funding is awarded to U.S. organizations that grant monies to local partners or grassroots groups, which implement the projects in their respective countries.",
      "Grassroots groups are involved in carrying out a range of humanitarian projects and activities, including working in hospitals or health clinics, fighting human trafficking, and running programs that advance democracy, entrepreneurship or conservation.",
      "The complex funding structure has routinely been criticized as not reaching grassroots groups quickly or directly enough, but regardless, thousands of advocates and workers around the world depended on USAID to carry out an enormous spectrum of civil society work.",
      "Freedom Collaborative, a global network of about 3,000 advocates against trafficking, had 80% of its budget cut after receiving a stop-work order last week, said CEO Julia Macher, who is based in Berlin. The organization said it is funded by a USAID subgrant through\u00a0Winrock International, an international development organization that manages 100 projects in 40 countries mostly for the U.S. government.",
      "Macher said since the freeze on federal funding, her group had been contacted by at least 50 partners. In a Freedom Collaborative newsletter, Macher cited organizations in the Balkans that provide direct services to survivors and in Thailand where workers in shelters don't have funds to pay for essentials like food, medical care and transportation. The work of\u00a0Cambodia's Chab Dai, a USAID-funded survivor support program, has been put on hold, affecting nine staff members and dozens of survivors, Freedom Collaborative said.",
      "The situation is especially dire for groups in Latin America, the newsletter said, including an organization in Ecuador that had to let go of 11 staff members working with migrants and trafficked individuals, and groups in Colombia that had to halt all their operations.",
      "Funding for this type of complex work \u2014 often done at great personal risk to local staff and victims \u2014 is already very difficult to secure. Often, the U.S. government would be the only donor willing to provide funds, Macher said. She stressed that the benefits of these programs reach far beyond the individuals receiving assistance.",
      "\"It helps with global stability, and that is the larger argument,\" she said. \"The work helps reduce organized crime. And if there is no response or watching these crime groups, they can start expanding, and that is very scary because then it's a ripple effect. It's not just about the humanitarian aspect.\"",
      "Stopping the work so suddenly has \"a huge impact on actual human lives,\" Macher said.",
      "Rubio told U.S. diplomats Wednesday that the United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid entirely, saying the agency needs to do a better job of explaining and defending where the money goes.",
      "\"We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify,\" Rubio said to about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "Rubio also noted that while foreign aid spending is not popular with the public, \"for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James plans to file a lawsuit with at least a dozen other state attorneys general against the Trump administration over the Department of Government Efficiency program, accusing DOGE of engaging in unauthorized access to sensitive information that includes Americans' data on federal computer systems at the Treasury Department.",
      "Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Rhode Island and Vermont are expected to join the suit, as DOGE continues its sweep through the federal government, demanding access and information, some of it sensitive.",
      "\"In the past week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has given Elon Musk access to Americans' personal private information, state bank account data, and other information that is some of our country's most sensitive data,\" James said in a statement.",
      "\"As the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is not used to being told 'no,' but in our country, no one is above the law. The president does not have the power to give away our private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,\" James said. \"This level of access for unauthorized individuals is unlawful, unprecedented, and unacceptable. DOGE has no authority to access this information, which they explicitly sought in order to block critical payments that millions of Americans rely on \u2014 payments that support health care, childcare, and other essential programs.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 17:59:50 -0500",
    "summary": "House Republicans met for several hours with Trump Thursday, after GOP senators planned move forward with their own plan to enact Trump's priorities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson urged his Senate GOP colleagues to wait for the House to \"do its work\" to advance President Trump's agenda. He and House Republicans met with Mr. Trump for several hours Thursday to discuss the budget reconciliation process central to approving key components of the measure, which is expected, among other things, to extend and expand the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term.",
      "The speaker said after the White House meeting that Republicans would meet again Thursday night to \"finish up some final details\" and said their intention is to produce a resolution for the House Budget Committee to mark up potentially as early as next week.",
      "\"So our message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is, 'Allow the House to do its work,'\" Johnson told reporters at the Capitol.",
      "The White House meeting came after Senate Republicans announced Wednesday that they\u00a0intended to move forward\u00a0with their own plan next week, since the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled. Senate Republicans are expected to meet with Mr. Trump Friday night at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Johnson sounded upbeat and described the meeting with Trump as \"very good\" and \"very productive\" and included a large cross-section of Republicans from the committees that will have jurisdiction on the legislation.",
      "Though he declined to offer details of the plan, he said there may be some announcements Friday. He praised the president for \"leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added that Republicans \"are narrowing down the areas of differences\" after a lot of \"give and take\" among the members who attended the White House meeting Thursday. He, too, praised the president's involvement.",
      "\"We obviously have to go talk to other groups within our conference now, but, but we made serious progress, and have narrowed the gap to where we're very close to getting ready to bring this to Budget Committee,\" Scalise told reporters.",
      "He confirmed that the group discussed some of the most polarizing items being considered for inclusion in the legislation: state and local tax cap reform, known as the SALT tax, and the debt ceiling. Scalise said members made progress but didn't arrive at a resolution on either front.",
      "The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are pursuing a number of legislative priorities through the budget reconciliation process, including approving resources to bolster border security, extending 2017 tax cuts, incentivizing domestic manufacturing and investing in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit.",
      "Though Republican leaders are generally united on the priorities, disagreement on the process has bogged down progress.",
      "Until Wednesday, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated for separating the priorities into two bills \u2014 one focused on border security while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should come later.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during the meeting that the president emphasized to lawmakers that his priorities included his no tax on tips or overtime pay proposals, no taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, renewing the 2017 tax cuts and adjusting the state and local tax deduction cap, known as the SALT cap, among other items.",
      "\"This will be the largest tax cut in history for middle class working Americans,\" Leavitt said. \"The president is committed to working with Congress to get this done.\"",
      "Under the budget reconciliation process, Congress can avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But the complicated maneuver requires that lawmakers first approve a budget resolution, and the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the budget measure.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate detainees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. government officials are moving rapidly to fulfill President Trump's orders to turn the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay into a massive immigration detention complex, making plans to send daily flights there with migrant detainees, two U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations told CBS News Thursday.",
      "So far, two U.S. military flights have been sent to Guantanamo Bay this week with fewer than two dozen migrant detainees who officials said have alleged ties to the notorious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, which is expected to be labeled a foreign terrorist group at Mr. Trump's direction.",
      "But the administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate the detainees, the U.S. officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans that have not been formally announced.",
      "More migrant detainee flights to Guantanamo are planned for Friday and the weekend, one of the officials said.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is planning to visit Guantanamo on Friday to assess officials' efforts to set up and prepare enough detention space to hold as many as 30,000 migrants, as the president called for in an executive order last week, sources familiar with the plans said.",
      "Military service members at the Naval Base have been setting up tents to act as holding sites with the goal of building enough for 2,000 migrants as part of an initial phase, though the alleged Venezuelan gang members transported to Guantanamo this week have been classified as \"high-threat\" detainees and held in cells inside the base's high-security prison. A separate part of the prison, created after the 9/11 attacks, also houses more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "The plans illustrate how quickly and aggressively the administration is moving to transform Guantanamo Bay, a 45-square-mile stretch of Cuban land the U.S. has leased for over a century, into a focal point of Mr. Trump's plans to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Being able to house thousands \u2014 and potentially, tens of thousands \u2014 of migrants in Guantanamo Bay would be a significant breakthrough for the Trump administration's mass deportation goals. While deportation officers have increased immigration arrests operations across the country in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office, the government is running out of space to house them.",
      "This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities reached 109% capacity, forcing the agency to release some migrant detainees after fitting them with ankle monitors.",
      "ICE has been scrambling to find additional detention space, making plans to set up as many as 18 new facilities within its own network of county jails and for-profit prisons, which currently have about 38,000 beds. On Tuesday morning, ICE had 42,000 detainees in custody.",
      "The agency is also asking other federal agencies and local law enforcement officials, like county sheriffs, to provide detention space. ICE has been permitted to use a Denver-area Space Force base to house its detainees, and other military sites are being considered for migrant detention. The agency is also considering using Border Patrol facilities, currently well under capacity due to a sharp drop in illegal border crossings, to hold those arrested in the U.S. interior.",
      "Still, the effort to convert the naval base in Guantanamo into a large-scale migrant holding site is already facing legal and operational challenges.",
      "Finding and mobilizing sufficient security guards to supervise the migrant detainees has been an issue limiting transfers to the base, the two U.S. officials said.",
      "For days, officials across federal agencies argued over who would have legal custody of the migrant detainees and what their legal rights would be, officials said. Ultimately, it was decided that ICE would continue to have legal custody over the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, pending their deportation.",
      "But it's unclear how long migrants will be detained in Guantanamo. The U.S. has not carried out deportations to Venezuela for a while due to frosty relations with the regime in Caracas. Mr. Trump recently announced a deportation deal with Venezuela's government, but it has not been implemented yet.",
      "The Trump administration and the government of President Nayib Bukele are forging an agreement that would allow the U.S. to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador, including suspected Venezuelan gang members. But that arrangement also has not been finalized yet.",
      "For decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, the U.S. has housed some migrants in the Guantanamo base. But that policy, until now, only applied to migrants intercepted at sea who were undergoing interviews to be resettled in third countries like Canada and Australia. Those migrants have been housed in a barrack-like facility that is separate from the newly-erected tents.",

      "As part of one of the lessons learned from the outbreak, the office was intended to formalize the so-called czar roles that had led efforts across the federal government to prepare and respond to pandemic threats.",
      "Parker was previously the associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University. \"One Health\" refers to the study of how health threats in animals and the environment are closely linked to human health concerns, including how dangerous viruses and bacteria often emerge in animals before spreading to humans.",
      "Spokespeople for the university and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "One of the first challenges Parker will have to tackle is the unprecedented spread of bird flu around the country.",
      "In recent months, variants of the virus have decimated the poultry and dairy industries, driven up egg prices and led to concerns about spillovers into humans, including one death in Louisiana.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the office was charged with coordinating the mammoth response operations at HHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has struggled to investigate and stomp out spread of the virus in farms.",
      "\"There are very few public health experts who have that breadth of knowledge around One Health and have dealt with animal health. And so, I think that is an advantage he has over many other people,\" said Jha.",

      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",
      "\"The magic happens in here,\" the company's CEO John Hartley told CBS News as he led our team on a guided tour of Levidian's patented LOOP system \u2014 a machine with a giant metal hopper shaped like a balloon.",
      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",

      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",

    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Space debris plummeting back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a new study.",
      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",

Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",

      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",

With the level of influence over the federal government that Musk appears to have, the American public has a right to know what his business interests and potential conflicts of interest are,\" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. \"He has spoken in the past of a need for a more transparent government. We agree. This isn't that.\"",
      "In December, Musk took to his platform, X, to say he doesn't believe Americans should have to file Freedom of Information Act requests because such information should already be public.",
      "\"There should be no need for FOIA requests,\" Musk wrote. \"All government data should be default public for maximum transparency.\"",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said it's \"concerning that the White House isn't saying we have nothing to hide and Musk's financial disclosure report will be released.\"",

      "The White House official who confirmed Musk's financial disclosure will be confidential also said Musk has a \"TS\" clearance, meaning top secret, the highest level of access to information apart from \"TS/SCI,\" which means top clearance for sensitive compartmentalized information.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

      "Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who President Trump named to the bench in 2019, said in court that he would approve a limited temporary restraining order that would block the employees from being put on administrative leave, a move that was set to take effect at midnight. He also said he would decide whether the 500 workers who are already on leave would be reinstated. Details on the pause would be set in a forthcoming filing, he said.",
      "He said the unions \u2014 American Foreign Service Association and American Federation of Government Employees \u2014 established they would suffer \"irreparable harm\" without a pause, while the government did not. \"Frankly, there is zero harm to the government\" in a short-term pause, Nichols said from the bench.",
      "At a hearing Friday afternoon, the plaintiffs asked the court to immediately pause evacuation orders given to USAID personnel in international postings, and for access to be restored to computers systems for people who are in the field across all parts of USAID and its contractors.",
      "The government acknowledged that 2,200 USAID employees were set to be put on leave at midnight barring court action, not including the other 500 people who are already on leave prior to today. Six hundred and eleven essential personnel would stay on at USAID, and the government added that it has no plans to lower that number.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the major reduction in force, evacuations and uprooting people from their jobs and homes were violations of the separation of powers and congressional appropriations. They said families are being separated, and children of USAID employees are being pulled out of schools across the world. Staffers have been cut off from access to health care, and many have to go back to states without housing or source of income, according to the unions.",
      "\"This is the full-scale gutting of virtually all of the personnel at an agency,\" a lawyer for USAID employees said, adding it is \"carnage\" on ground for the USAID workforce and contractors.",
      "Nichols pressed the government's attorneys for a reason why Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is the acting head of USAID, needs to place the employees on leave Friday night. \"I don't believe Secretary Rubio needs to provide one,\" one of the lawyers responded.",
      "Nichols pushed the government lawyers to detail what \"findings\" they have that there is corruption and fraud in the agency, as is alleged by President Trump and his allies. The attorneys had no response. The judge also took issue with the government's framing of Rubio being able to control USAID in his role as secretary of state, not as acting administrator, given that it is a separate agency.",
      "Nichols decision to block the move to place the employees on leave came hours after workers were seen removing the signage at the USAID headquarters in downtown Washington.",

      "Just minutes after Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy and other officers responded to Massey's 911 call about a potential prowler outside her home Grayson shot and killed Massey in her kitchen when she checked on a pot of boiling water in her own kitchen while saying, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"",
      "Grayson later said he felt threatened by her, but he was fired from the sheriff's office and charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery, and official misconduct in Massey's death. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and remains in jail, but is fighting in court to be released from custody while he awaits trial.",
      "The $10 million settlement with Massey's family must be approved by the Sangamon County Board. A source on the board said the settlement is expected to be approved at their next meeting on Feb. 11.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 14:55:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping\u00a0order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 09:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "First appointed to the five-person board by President Joe Biden in 2021, Wilcox was confirmed by the Senate in December to serve a second term that was supposed to last through 2028. In the letter informing her of her removal, Mr. Trump said she had not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of [his] administration.\"",
      "By firing Wilcox, Mr. Trump left the board, which mediates labor disputes and protects workers rights, without enough members to function. And it's part of a string of actions Mr. Trump has taken in the first few weeks of his term against independent agencies whose leaders generally remain in place across administrations and have some legal protections.",
      "In response, Wilcox sued Mr. Trump on Wednesday, alleging that her firing\u00a0 was \"unprecedented and illegal.\" In the 90 years since Congress established the agency, no president has attempted to remove a member of the board, Wilcox said.",
      "\"The law is that board members cannot be removed from their position unless they've engaged in neglect or duty or malfeasance, Wilcox said. \"And based upon the letter I received, there was no claim of that. There [wasn't] any cause or any reason that I was actually terminated.\"",
      "Wilcox's lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, asserts that her dismissal was a \"blatant violation\" of the National Labor Relations Act that protects board members from being fired by the president without cause.",
      "\"He does not have the authority to remove me based on my views,\" said Wilcox, a lawyer who prior to her position at NLRB represented labor unions.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the litigation. The administration has previously said Mr. Trump has the right to fire any executive branch employee that he wishes to, a claim that is also being contested in other lawsuits.",
      "Wilcox is asking a judge to declare her removal unlawful and reinstate her as a member of the board. In the filing, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump may try to use the litigation as a \"test case\" for the courts, suggesting that if her firing is upheld, it could set a precedent that would expand presidential power.\u00a0 But, at the same time, she says if she didn't take legal action, it would render the laws protecting the independence of agencies like hers meaningless.",
      "\"If I don't fight, that means the president gets to do whatever he wants to do in violation of the law,\" said Wilcox, who is the first black woman to serve on the board.",
      "Wilcox said her removal, which left the labor watchdog without a necessary quorum required by law, puts workers' rights at risk and takes away a resource to resolve labor disputes.",
      "Recently, the board took actions to protect the rights of workers at Amazon and SpaceX. She told CBS News that she will take the case to the Supreme Court \"if it's necessary.\"",
      "\"I feel very strongly about this case,\" she said. \"It's bigger than me.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump, in a news conference with the Japanese prime minister, indicated that Elon Musk will have wide latitude to go into federal departments and agencies as he aims to slash federal spending by $2 trillion.",
      "He said he's asked Musk to review \"just about\" every federal agency.",
      "\"Pentagon, Education, just about everything,\" the president said. \"We're gonna go through everything.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he tells Musk where to go, and he goes to that agency.",
      "\"I will pick out a target, and I say, 'Go in,'\" the president said.",
      "In response to a reporter's question about why DOGE needs access to Americans' personal information, like bank accounts and Social Security numbers, the president appeared to support DOGE's efforts while indicating that it did not need the data.",
      "\"Well, it doesn't, but they get it very easily, I mean we don't have very good security in our country,\" Mr. Trump said. However, DOGE has obtained access to the information because of the president's orders allowing it, not because of a lapse in security.",
      "He added DOGE would be examining trillions in federal funds spent \"perhaps illegally.\" He said he's proud of the job \"this group of young people\" is doing.",
      "The president weighed in on a DOGE staff member, Marco Elez, who resigned, according to the Wall Street Journal, which linked him to a now-defunct social media account expressing racist and eugenic views. The Journal found a post from last July that read, \"Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.\" In September, another post on X read, \"You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate.\" CBS News has not confirmed the existence of the account or posts. The Journal said that Elez did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, in response to a poll on X, said of Elez's employment, \"I obviously disagree with some of Elez's posts, but I don't think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid's life. We shouldn't reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever. So I say bring him back. If he's a bad dude or a terrible member of the team, fire him for that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he wasn't familiar with the details, but if Vance supported bringing the employee back, \"I'm with the vice president.\"",
      "Soon after the news conference, Musk said Elez would be rehired. \"He will be brought back,\" he wrote on X. \"To err is human, to forgive divine.\"",
      "The president was also asked whether he intended to fire the FBI agents who worked on the investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"No, but I'll fire some of them because some of them were corrupt,\" he replied.",
      "During the news conference, which followed Mr. Trump's meeting with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the president praised Ishiba and had warm words for the U.S.-Japan relationship, but still indicated that Japan would be subject to new tariffs.",
      "\"We're going to have tariffs, mostly reciprocal tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said, and those would be announced early next week. \"Very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way nobody's hurt,\" he added, \"as opposed to a flat-fee tariff.\"",
      "The president also said that Nippon Steel's deal to buy U.S. Steel would be restructured as an investment, rather than an outright purchase.",
      "\"They've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel, as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting,\" the president said. \"And we're going to meet with Nissan next week, the head of Nissan, very great company, and they'll work out the details,\" Trump said (he appeared to have said \"Nissan,\" though Nippon is the name of the Japanese steel company.",
      "Ishiba said that Japanese technology would be provided, and that \"better quality products will be manufactured in the United States.\"",
      "The president also announced Japan would be taking in new shipments of American liquified natural gas or LNG \"in record numbers.\"",
      "In his opening remarks, the president said he's \"confident that the cherished alliances between our two countries and others also will continue to flourish long and into the future.\" He added, \"The military cooperation between the United States and Japan is one of our closest security partnerships, and it's one of the closest we have anywhere in the world.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two leaders spoke \"long and hard\" about their economic and trade relationship and noted Japan's outsized investments in the U.S. Mr. Trump said Japan will have some \"competition,\" because other countries are also eager to invest in the U.S.",
      "Ishiba, through a translator, said their discussion was \"frank\" and \"productive.\" The two leaders said they would issue a joint Japan-U.S. statement, which would serve as a compass. \"I look forward to working with President Trump, whom I respect immensely, to usher in a new golden age of Japan-U.S. relations,\" the Japanese leader said.",
      "Trump and Japanese prime minister discuss U.S. Steel, tariffs, automotive issues, national security",
      "Before the news conference, among the top issues to come up during Mr. Trump's meeting with the Japanese prime minister was Nippon Steel's deal to acquire U.S. Steel, despite former President Joe Biden's rejection of the merger and Mr. Trump's previous pledge to block the deal.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday he hadn't changed his mind on U.S. Steel, but multiple sources said earlier that he was considering allowing Nippon to complete its $14.1 billion acquisition. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that he and the Japanese prime minister would be discussing the U.S. steel deal.",
      "Mr. Trump met with the CEO of U.S. Steel, David Burritt, at the White House on Thursday. The Biden administration blocked the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel last month. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have filed lawsuits over the Biden administration's decision to stop Nippon Steel from taking over its Pittsburgh-based rival company.",
      "\"The United States is proud of our long and close alliance with Japan, and it's time for a new age of U.S. Japan relations to bring peace and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific,\" a senior administration official told reporters on a phone call. \"Our two nations will continue to work together to ensure we deter threats in the region through our full range of military capabilities.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's appearance with the Japanese prime minister is his second meeting and joint press conference with a foreign leader this week. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said the U.S. wants to take control of and \"own\" the Gaza Strip.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The International Criminal Court on Friday condemned sanctions imposed on its officials by President Trump. The United Nations court, which is in the Hague, Netherlands, said the U.S. measures were intended to \"harm (the Court's) independent and impartial judicial work.\"",
      "\"The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world, in all Situations before it,\" the ICC said in a statement. \"We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his executive order on Thursday that the ICC had \"engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\"",
      "\"The United States unequivocally opposes and expects our allies to oppose any ICC actions against the United States, Israel, or any other ally of the United States that has not consented to ICC jurisdiction,\" the executive order said.",
      "The sanctions place visa and financial restrictions on individuals who work on ICC investigations into citizens of the U.S. or any U.S. ally that \"has not consented to ICC jurisdiction,\" or their immediate family members.",
      "The ICC, Israel and the war in Gaza",
      "Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, along with Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, whom Israel said was killed in an airstrike in July. Hamas confirmed his death last month.",
      "Deif was accused by the ICC judges of being \"responsible for the crimes against humanity of murder; extermination; torture; and rape and other forms of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture; taking hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and rape and other form of sexual violence,\" in connection to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Judges found \"reasonable grounds to believe that\" Netanyahu and Gallant \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity, from at least 8 October 2023 to 20 May 2024,\" when the ICC prosecutor filed applications for the arrest warrants, an ICC statement said in November.",
      "\"This finding is based on the role of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant in impeding humanitarian aid in violation of international humanitarian law and their failure to facilitate relief by all means at its disposal,\" the ICC said.",
      "Judges at the ICC \"found that their conduct led to the disruption of the ability of humanitarian organizations to provide food and other essential goods to the population in need in Gaza. The aforementioned restrictions together with cutting off electricity and reducing fuel supply also had a severe impact on the availability of water in Gaza and the ability of hospitals to provide medical care.\"",
      "What is the ICC?",
      "There are a number of international treaties, including the Geneva Convention and the Geneva Protocol, that establish international legal standards for warfare. Violations of these standards are war crimes that can be prosecuted at the ICC.",
      "The ICC was founded in 2002 under an international treaty known commonly as the Rome Statute. ICC jurisdiction applies in over 120 countries that are States Parties to the statute and to their citizens.",
      "Neither the United States nor Israel are signatories to the treaty.",
      "The ICC tries individuals for crimes under four broad categories: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.",
      "According to the court's own figures, it has heard 32 cases and issued 60 arrest warrants. The judges have handed down 11 convictions and four acquittals.",
      "International response to U.S. sanctions against ICC",
      "Dozens of countries, including Canada, Germany and Mexico, reaffirmed their support for the ICC in a joint statement released Friday.",
      "\"The Court serves as a vital pillar of the international justice system by ensuring accountability for the most serious international crimes, and justice for victims,\" and measures sanctioning it \"increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten to erode the international rule of law, which is crucial for promoting global order and security,\" the statement said.",

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a briefing that China \"firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.\"",
      "The Belt and Road Initiative is President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy drive to bind China closer to countries in the region and beyond by building roads, railways, airports, power plants and other infrastructure.",
      "The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact.",
      "Panama's decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.",
      "Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade. On Wednesday, Mulino vehemently rejected a claim issued the previous day by the U.S. State Department that a deal had been reached for U.S. military vessels to traverse the canal free of charge. Mulino said the U.S. statement was \"based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "Later Thursday, asked about Mulino's remarks, Rubio said he wasn't confused about his discussions with leaders in Panama, adding: \"I respect very much the fact that Panama has a process of laws and procedures that they need to follow.\"",

I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.\"",
      "Despite Mulino's firm stance on Thursday, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway in Panama and could lead to a rebidding process.",

      "The Associated Press obtained audio of the broadcast, as well as video and photos showing the blaze, that three military officials said were gathered by a ship from a NATO nation operating nearby. The officials, also from a NATO country, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven't publicly reported.",
      "The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia's fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely because of concerns that Moscow might sabotage underwater cables and pipelines amid tensions over the war in Ukraine. Even though the Kildin was in trouble, the secretive ship didn't respond to an offer of help from the NATO vessel, the officials said.",
      "The U.K. last month tracked another Russian vessel that it identified as a spy ship in the English Channel. The Defense Ministry said the Yantar \"was caught loitering over critical undersea infrastructure\" and that a Royal Navy submarine surfaced close to the ship \"to warn it had been secretly monitoring its every move.\"",
      "At the time, British Defense Secretary John Healey warned Russia's President Vladimir Putin: \"We know what you're doing.\"\u00a0 Healey said a Royal Navy submarine was authorized to surface close to the Yantar \"strictly as a deterrent measure\" and \"to make clear that we have been covertly monitoring its every move,\"\u00a0BBC News reported.",

      "The 55-year-old Kildin gathers intelligence on NATO activities in the Mediterranean and had been operating near naval exercises by alliance member Turkey before the fire, according to the officials who spoke to the AP.",
      "They said the blaze burned for at least four hours and that the Kildin's crew removed the covers from lifeboats though they never put them to sea.",
      "The Kildin also hoisted two black balls from its masts - a maritime signal that the ship can no longer steer, the officials said.",
      "They said the crew eventually regained control and that the Kildin is still stationed and gathering intelligence off the Syrian port of Tartus, accompanied by a frigate and a supply vessel. It is not clear what caused the blaze.",

      "He dismissed suggestions that it reflected poorly on Russian naval readiness. \"Assessing the state of the fleet based on the breakdown of one particular ship or one particular malfunction is not professional,\" Peskov said.",
      "Retired Vice Adm. Michel Olhagaray, a former head of France's center for higher military studies, said that even though the Kildin regained steering, the fire highlights the logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean, far from its bases in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea.",
      "Moscow also is no longer able to use its Black Sea Fleet for Mediterranean patrols because during the Ukraine war Turkey isn't allowing warships to pass through the Bosporus, which links the Black and Mediterranean seas.",
      "\"The maintenance of this Russian fleet, particularly in the Mediterranean, is extraordinarily complex,\" Olhagaray said.",

      "The audio gathered by the NATO ship is a 75-second radio exchange between the Kildin and a Togo-flagged cargo ship, Milla Moon, the officials said.",
      "The AP also obtained a second recording of conversations among crew members aboard the NATO ship. In that, they can be heard identifying the exchange they've just monitored as being between the Kildin and a Togolese vessel. Military officials provided both recordings to the AP, which was not able to independently authenticate them.",
      "Ship-tracking websites that use the data vessels emit on their identity, position, speed and course show the Milla Moon lifted anchor off Tartus and started cruising northward along Syria's coast on Jan. 23. That was the day of the Kildin fire, also in waters off Tartus, the military officials said.",
      "They said the Kildin at first identified itself to the Milla Moon as another ship, the Sky, and then asked to switch channels to continue the conversation.",
      "After the switch, the man with accented English is then heard identifying his vessel as a warship.",
      "\"Motor vessel Milla Moon, this is warship on your course,\" the voice can be heard saying on the clip. \"Please hear me.\"",
      "He asks the Milla Moon to steer clear.",
      "\"I am drifting. I'm not under command,\" he says.",
      "Milla Moon responds that it will plot a course away before signing off with, \"You are welcome. Good watch. Goodbye.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 06:08:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Paris' centuries-old Louvre Museum \u2014 home of da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa \u2014 is getting an $800 million makeover, and American visitors will have to help pay for it.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 It is the most visited museum in the world, but management, staff and visitors agree the iconic Louvre in Paris \u2014 the home of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa\u00a0\u2014 is in need of some serious TLC.",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" Louvre Museum director Laurence des Cars acknowledged to CBS News. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "But it's also an issue of upkeep. The last major renovation of the museum was more than three decades ago, when renowned architect I.M. Pei's now-iconic glass pyramid was added to serve as the main entrance.",
      "When that entrance was inaugurated in 1989, however, the architects were planning for about 4 million visitors per year. Last year, the Louvre drew 9 million people, and officials hope to see that annual footfall rise to 12 million in the years ahead.",
      "To allow for that increase, French President Emmanuel Macron last month announced an ambitious 10-year plan to refurbish and expand the museum. The plans include establishing a new entrance on the east side of the building, to help manage the flow of visitors.",
      "It will become the main entrance, as the pyramid is simply too small to cope with the current number of visitors, let alone the anticipated increase. The access point is small, space below it is limited, and in the summer it gets very hot under all the glass. The Louvre Pyramid will continue to be a visitor access point, however.",
      "The new entrance will open onto the museum's eastern courtyard, the Cour Carr\u00e9e, and the plan is to expand downwards, building new galleries underneath it. One of those galleries has been earmarked as a new home for the Louvre's most famous piece, the Mona Lisa.",
      "If you ask the people standing in line outside the museum what they're most looking forward to seeing, the vast majority will reply \"the Mona Lisa.\"",
      "Carlos from San Diego didn't even hesitate: \"I always wanted to see it, ever since I was little,\" he told CBS News. \"I'm a big fan and this is one of the things that I look forward to.\"",
      "\"You can never get enough of it,\" said Ella, visiting from Canada, who had already been to the Louvre on several previous visits to Paris.",
      "But once inside the room where Mona Lisa currently lives, her global allure means crowds jostling to catch a glimpse of her mysterious face. The painting's relatively small size often comes as a shock to visitors, some of whom are left using the zoom function on their smartphone cameras to get a closer look.",
      "Da Vinci's masterpiece is in the Salle des \u00c9tats, the largest room in the Louvre. It is also home to major works by the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, which often go ignored. The remarkable piece, The Wedding Feast at Cana, by Veronese, fills the back wall, facing the Mona Lisa. But visitors often walk straight past it without even seeing it.",
      "\"She's a sort of universal masterpiece,\" says des Cars. \"People want to spend time with her, and that's okay. And we need to organize that. But the Louvre is filled with 1,000 Mona Lisas.\"",
      "She says one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre\".",
      "Des Cars believes the new main entrance will also link the museum to the city around it in a more concrete way. \"The Pyramid is a wonderful, wonderful piece of architecture,\" she says. \"But it is a bit isolated in Paris, not in direct contact with the city. The eastern entrance will allow us to connect directly to the city, and so we think it's a perfect balance for this extraordinary building.\"",
      "The ambitious refurbishment will take a total of 10 years: Six years for the expansion and another four for vital repairs to the building and upgrades to outdated technical installations. The security system will also be updated to accommodate the ever-increasing numbers who pass through the museum's doors.",
      "The project is expected to cost around $800 million. Macron promised that French taxpayers would not have to foot the bill - although government funds will cover the $10 million cost of the initial surveys and plans.",
      "To help pay for all the work, ticket pricing will change \u2014 and visitors from outside the European Union will have to pay more from next year. French and European taxes help fund public cultural institutions, so the argument is that they are already paying on top of the entry ticket, unlike visitors from farther afield.",
      "\"It's not to discourage international tourism or to punish anyone, but it's the reality of the economy,\" said des Cars.",
      "The Louvre has also launched a fundraising drive, hoping the museum's stature will open purse strings around the world, so that it can continue to hold on to its number one spot, while adapting to the times.",

    "summary": "Panama's president says the State Department's claim of an agreement granting U.S. warships free canal passage was \"based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
    "story": [
      "Panama City\u00a0\u2014 Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\"I completely reject that statement yesterday,\" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department's statement.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said in a social media post: \"U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\" to the fees, adding that it was \"willing to establish a dialogue with the pertinent officials from the United States in regards to the transit of U.S. Navy ships.\"",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \"really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "The differing versions came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route. He had carried a message from President Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable, as the Trump administration makes a push for U.S. control of the canal, which it says it needs for America's economic security.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In their meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump had determined that China's influence on the canal constituted \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mulino has refuted those claims, and he said Thursday that both Panama's constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees.",

    "story": [
      "Abdul Fatorma, chief executive of the Campaign for Human Rights and Development International, had been working on expanding democracy in Sierra Leone for seven years.",
      "Civil war had plagued the West African coastal nation for decades, ending in 2002 \u2014 and slowly, peace had returned, helping to reduce migration and violence. Essential to that progress, Sierra Leone's civil service advocates believe, is nurturing democracy and human rights. Fatorma's grassroots campaign was granted $1 million in U.S. funding in 2023 to continue work on those goals.",
      "Around two years later the project \u2014 which promoted meaningful participation of all citizens in their political systems, expanded the reach of civic education and encouraged female aspirants to run for office \u2014 ended last week when Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. Almost all of the agency's workers are being put on leave.",
      "\"It came as a shock, and devastating,\" said Fatorma\u00a0from his office in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. He added the loss created \"a gap\" in funding and a \"vacuum in governance\" that he said Russia or China could rush to fill.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget. A large portion of the funding is awarded to U.S. organizations that grant monies to local partners or grassroots groups, which implement the projects in their respective countries.",
      "Grassroots groups are involved in carrying out a range of humanitarian projects and activities, including working in hospitals or health clinics, fighting human trafficking, and running programs that advance democracy, entrepreneurship or conservation.",
      "The complex funding structure has routinely been criticized as not reaching grassroots groups quickly or directly enough, but regardless, thousands of advocates and workers around the world depended on USAID to carry out an enormous spectrum of civil society work.",
      "Freedom Collaborative, a global network of about 3,000 advocates against trafficking, had 80% of its budget cut after receiving a stop-work order last week, said CEO Julia Macher, who is based in Berlin. The organization said it is funded by a USAID subgrant through\u00a0Winrock International, an international development organization that manages 100 projects in 40 countries mostly for the U.S. government.",
      "Macher said since the freeze on federal funding, her group had been contacted by at least 50 partners. In a Freedom Collaborative newsletter, Macher cited organizations in the Balkans that provide direct services to survivors and in Thailand where workers in shelters don't have funds to pay for essentials like food, medical care and transportation. The work of\u00a0Cambodia's Chab Dai, a USAID-funded survivor support program, has been put on hold, affecting nine staff members and dozens of survivors, Freedom Collaborative said.",
      "The situation is especially dire for groups in Latin America, the newsletter said, including an organization in Ecuador that had to let go of 11 staff members working with migrants and trafficked individuals, and groups in Colombia that had to halt all their operations.",
      "Funding for this type of complex work \u2014 often done at great personal risk to local staff and victims \u2014 is already very difficult to secure. Often, the U.S. government would be the only donor willing to provide funds, Macher said. She stressed that the benefits of these programs reach far beyond the individuals receiving assistance.",
      "\"It helps with global stability, and that is the larger argument,\" she said. \"The work helps reduce organized crime. And if there is no response or watching these crime groups, they can start expanding, and that is very scary because then it's a ripple effect. It's not just about the humanitarian aspect.\"",
      "Stopping the work so suddenly has \"a huge impact on actual human lives,\" Macher said.",
      "Rubio told U.S. diplomats Wednesday that the United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid entirely, saying the agency needs to do a better job of explaining and defending where the money goes.",
      "\"We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify,\" Rubio said to about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "Rubio also noted that while foreign aid spending is not popular with the public, \"for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",

      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",
      "Dr. Ellie Galanis, head of commercial development at Levidian, was keen to show off a harvest of graphene from the LOOP hopper at the company's lab.",

    "story": [
      "The United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid around the world but needs to do a better job explaining and defending programs receiving assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. diplomats behind closed doors Wednesday.",
      "\"The United States is not walking away from foreign aid. It's not. We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid,\" Rubio told about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "\"This is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on,\" Rubio added. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board \u2014 it really is. But for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",
      "The State Department and embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Over 14 years in the U.S. Senate, Rubio served at different times as top Republican on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees and became a lead GOP voice on foreign policy matters.",
      "This week he is on his first overseas mission, a five-day tour of Central America and the Caribbean that is designed to reinforce his belief that the U.S. needs to more directly engage its closest neighbors as it seeks to curb illegal immigration and the trade of illicit drugs.",
      "The trip has coincided with a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. Agency for International Development that came to a head last weekend as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency confronted top agency officials, seeking to learn more about the scope of foreign aid. President Trump signed an executive order Monday essentially folding the agency's functions into the State Department and named Rubio its acting administrator.",
      "As part of the overhaul, USAID staff were told Tuesday that most staff would be placed on leave Friday night, with exceptions for \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, when Rubio met with embassy personnel in Guatemala, he was asked by the head of USAID in Guatemala about the future of the agency.",
      "\"That's a question that deserves a straight and honest answer, and I'll give it to you,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript.",
      "He said he is hoping to choose all \"specially designated programs\" by Friday amid a broader review of all foreign aid.",
      "The secretary said he is now seeking input directly from ambassadors around the globe after receiving a list of USAID programs in Guatemala from U.S. Ambassador Tobin Bradley early Wednesday. But he also faulted agency officials in Washington for failing to cooperate with Musk's team.",
      "\"We hope to achieve \u2014 over the next 36 to 48 hours \u2014 what I'd hope to do in a more orderly way, from the top down ... now we're going to have to achieve it from the bottom up, defining what those special missions are,\" he said.",
      "Rubio cited USAID funding to combat Ebola and some projects run by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS, or PEPFAR, as early examples of exceptions that will continue.",
      "\"It has to be done in a way that's transparent, and we weren't getting those answers. We just weren't, at least not from the top down,\" Rubio said. \"So now, we're going to have to pursue it from the bottom up. That's always been our goal with our intention here, and that's going to continue to be our goal and our intention.\"",
      "On Saturday, two top security officials at USAID headquarters in Washington were\u00a0placed on administrative leave, two sources confirmed to CBS News. Multiple sources said they were fired for attempting to block a DOGE team from accessing classified material in restricted areas.",
      "As a broader review of foreign aid continues, Rubio said he's seeking to continue some funding and has issued waivers to address aid delays for essential services. But a USAID staffer and multiple NGOs tell CBS News that operators on the ground are not able to distribute the aid because the operations, payment and computer systems are offline after they were shut down by the Department of Government Efficiency, effectively rendering Rubio's waiver powerless.",
      "Tom Hart, the CEO of InterAction, an alliance of 170 NGOs, says many of those groups now face bankruptcy because they cannot access credit or U.S. financing because USAID systems were taken down. About 40% of InterAction's members receive USAID funding.\"",
      "\"While the policy is in place through Secretary Rubio's order, and even paperwork has been delivered to some of our partner NGOs, they've not been able to get the assistance, the money, to continue operations,\" Hart said. \"So, we have the policy, we have the paperwork, we just don't have the funding flowing to keep that emergency relief going.\"",
      "Hart also pointed out that because USAID has revoked all its personnel and contractors, \"all those experts who help provide the evaluation of \u2014 does this program fit within the exemption that Secretary Rubio announced \u2014 are no longer there and working.\"",
      "The Tuesday notice put all USAID staff on administrative leave effective midnight Friday and ordered back to the U.S. all workers posted abroad within 30 days if their contracts are determined to be non-essential. The email to the USAID workers said the agency plans to consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions of staffers who need to stay on the job, and return travel extensions are possible based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "Rubio told diplomats Wednesday those exceptions \"came from input from the ground, not from anybody else.\" He cited examples of USAID employees who are married and have children with State Department staffers assigned to the same embassy.",
      "\"So now you're basically leaving them with the option of saying, 'So I have to leave behind my spouse and my children, potentially, and uproot myself and go.' That's not our intention. We don't want to achieve that,\" he said.",
      "He also noted, \"There are members of [USAID] that are in the third trimester of a pregnancy.\" Others, he said, might require special medical attention.",
      "\"We have a case, I know in particular, of someone who has to go to dialysis three times a week,\" he said. \"And so to be ordered to leave is disruptive in terms of, like, continuing with the course of care. And there are people that are deployed in places, frankly, where we don't want them stranded with them, because, it's not, you can't just catch a commercial flight and come home.\"",
      "He concluded his lengthy answer by asking the diplomats for grace.",
      "\"I know it's hard to ask for patience. I know it's hard to ask for trust, because you've never met me before. I've never been in charge of the State Department. I've never been acting USAID administrator before. I don't get paid double for doing that, by the way.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

      "\"Australia is home to the greatest diversity of marsupial fauna on the planet but it also has the highest mammal extinction rate,\" lead researcher Andres Gambini said in a statement.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is to support the preservation of endangered marsupial species like koalas, Tasmanian devils, northern hairy-nosed wombats and Leadbeater's possums.\"",
      "Scientists produced the embryos by a technique that involves injecting a single sperm directly into a mature egg.",
      "\"Because eastern grey kangaroos are overabundant, we collected their eggs and sperm for use as a model to adapt the embryo technologies already applied to domestic animals and humans,\" Gambini said. \"We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm.\"",
      "With the right collaboration, funding and technical advancements, an IVF-assisted marsupial birth might be possible within a decade, the researcher said.",
      "Overall kangaroo numbers fluctuate between 30 million and 60 million in Australia, and they're frequently culled to keep populations in check.",
      "The animals have a \"boom and bust\" population cycle -- when food is plentiful following a good wet season, their numbers can balloon by tens of millions. But some other marsupial populations are far more precarious.",
      "It's estimated that there are only 20,000 to 50,000 Tasmanian devils in the wild, for example, down from as many as 150,000 before a mysterious facial tumor disease first struck in the mid-1990s.",

    "story": [
      "Criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigden joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the latest on the legal saga between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.",
      "Johnny Depp's former attorney, who represented him in the defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard, said Justin Badoni and \"It Ends with Us\" co-star Blake Lively could face \"real danger\" as their legal drama continues to unfold ahead of an upcoming trial.",
      "In a new interview with \"Law & Crime: Sidebar with Jessie Weber,\" Benjamin Chew weighed in on the public feud between the two co-stars and explained why the heated back-and-forth could put both parties at \"risk\" in court.",
      "\"They both are well-represented, and they both can make cases in support of their respective positions,\" said Chew. \"So there's a real danger \u2026 that the jury could essentially hang or that there might be some on the jury to say directly or indirectly attacks on both of [them].",
      "\"Again, it goes back to the issue of whether they can really convince the jury as to the serious allegations here, but I also think there's a danger of them meeting in the middle and some people on the jury just saying, 'Look, these are two wealthy attractive people. I don't know what to do here.'",

      "\"I think there is risk on both sides,\" he later added. \"I think this is a fascinating case and will become more fascinating as it goes along. And the more they play into the media, I think the more pressure there's going to be on that judge. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he will end up saying, 'I'm going to expedite this thing. I don't want a circus, I want this thing over with.' So it will be fascinating to see this play out.\"",

      "In December, Lively detailed allegations of sexual harassment, retaliation, intentional affliction of emotional distress, negligence and more against Baldoni and film producer Jamey Heath in a complaint first filed with the California Civil Rights department and later in federal court.",
      "In response, Baldoni filed a $400 million lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds, accusing them of civil extortion and defamation.",
      "Justin Baldoni launched a website featuring an amended complaint against \"It Ends with Us\" co-star Blake Lively. (Getty Images)",
      "On Saturday, Baldoni took things one step further by launching a website that features a landing page with links to two PDF files, including a copy of a newly amended complaint that the 41-year-old actor filed against the 37-year-old actress and Reynolds and another document with a 168-page \"timeline of relevant events\" that showcased new emails and texts related to the case.",
      "\"I think it is very aggressive,\" Chew said of Baldoni's website launch.",
      "\"Usually you would not do something like that before a hearing, but I'm sure that they vetted it carefully,\" Chew said, referring to Baldoni's legal team. \"They vetted the material carefully. Certainly, posting a pleading doesn't seem to me to be out of bounds. These are pleadings made in the public records. Whenever you're getting into work product or advocacy pieces, then I think it's getting closer to the line, but it is a novel approach, a bold approach.\"",
      "Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn agreed with Chew, adding that the launch was smart on Baldoni's end.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni continue to go head-to-head ahead of a trial scheduled for March 2026.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",

      "\"I agree it is aggressive, but smartly so,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"This case is largely going to be decided by the court of public opinion, and Justin Baldoni setting up a bare-bones website with his complaint and timeline allows the public to understand his perspective without the filter of the media and decide for themselves what they think.\"",
      "David Fish, litigation partner of Romano Law, shares the same thought as Chew in that Baldoni\u2019s website launch was a \"calculated risk,\" but notes it could work against him at trial.",
      "He told Fox News Digital, \"\u2026Baldoni\u2019s novel approach could backfire in court. Judges typically disfavor pre-trial publicity that risks tainting a jury pool and, in fact, the federal judge has already warned both sides against litigating the case in the media. By launching a website and publicizing evidence, Baldoni\u2019s team might be seen as trying to win in the press rather than in court, which could hurt his credibility with the judge and jury. Additionally, his focus on narrative control over legal arguments might be viewed as a distraction tactic, especially given the allegations against him. If the court perceives his strategy as an attempt to sway public opinion rather than defend himself legally, it could lead to restrictions on his team\u2019s statements or even impact procedural decisions in the case.\"",

      "Celebrity attorney Chris Melcher of Walzer Melcher & Yoda, disagrees that the move was \"aggressive\" and said it's imperative that Baldoni defend himself.",
      "\"These are public court documents Baldoni is posting to the website, and there is nothing wrong with, essentially, making light of a public document,\" Melcher told Fox News Digital. \"Keep in mind, Baldoni is responding to Lively's complaint. You could make the argument that either both of them are right or they're both wrong for doing so.",
      "\"This case is largely going to be decided by the court of public opinion, and Justin Baldoni setting up a bare-bones website with his complaint and timeline allows the public to understand his perspective without the filter of the media and decide for themselves what they think.\"",
      "\"It will take a long time to get to trial,\" he added. \"In the meantime, this will be tried in the court of public opinion. Waiting until 2026 to reclaim his reputation does Baldoni no good. He needs to defend himself publicly because he's been attacked publicly.\"",

      "Depp sued Heard for $50 million over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post alleging she was the victim of domestic abuse. Heard countersued her ex-husband for $100 million, accusing him and his former attorney of conspiring to \"destroy and defame\" her. Depp eventually won the lawsuit.",
      "Chew said that while there are comparisons between the Lively and Baldoni and Depp and Heard cases, the challenges are different.",
      "In 2022, Depp and Heard squared off in a bombshell defamation trial. Depp eventually won the lawsuit.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"I think there are some comparisons you have on both sides,\" Chew said. \"You have prominent actors, which you had also in the Depp case. I think the stakes are a little bit different in this case. In Johnny's case, he was suing for defamation. He was really suing to get his reputation back. It was more of an existential issue for him. A challenge that we had, and I think the other side had, but I think they really have it in this case, is to convince a jury of laypeople why they should care about a dispute between two very powerful, successful, attractive actors. And I think that's a challenge irrespective of the serious nature of the allegations.\"",
      "Urbahn agreed.",
      "\"What ultimately happens in the Justin Baldoni-Blake Lively case will be a test of whether the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard outcome was a fluke or the beginning of the post-MeToo era,\" she said. \"The MeToo movement was a response to centuries of the she in he said/she said situations not mattering. Thankfully, that changed and where MeToo did create some good.",
      "\"However, as is the case with any reactionary movement, the pendulum swung so far, MeToo created a new standard for men: \u2018Believe all women,\u2019 meaning, men were now guilty until proven innocent, which, of course, is just as unfair as what had happened to women in the past.",
      "\"The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial was a situation where it felt, for the first time in many years, that both what he said and she said equally mattered and was being given equal weight,\" she said. \"How the Baldoni-Lively matter resolves will be a marker in both the court of public opinion and court of law as to whether this balance of fairness for both sides is here to stay.\"",

      "\"I think we are seeing more artists shift to country from both a fiscal and cultural lens. From a financial standpoint, country music audiences are some of the most loyal listeners, and the genre still somewhat prioritizes more financially beneficial dissemination methods like album sales and radio play, as opposed to other genres that almost wholly rely on streaming.

Nonetheless, considering that she has yet to release her re-recording of her debut album, I could see a country album or tracks naturally following its release. This would align with both her musical evolution and her penchant for revisiting and revitalizing her earlier work. A return to country music would not only be a nod to her origins but also a strategic embrace of the genre\u2019s current resurgence in mainstream popularity. Whether this speculation comes to fruition remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly within the realm of possibility for an artist known for both her musical versatility and her strategic career moves.\""

      "\"It Ends with Us\" stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni are embroiled in a heated legal battle with \"a number of \u2018he said/she said\u2019 allegations,\" with the intimate scenes from their movie being the biggest points of contention.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni in December for sexual harassment that allegedly took place while filming the Colleen Hoover-adapted film. The \"Gossip Girl\" star claimed an intimacy coordinator had not been present on set and later demanded one be at all times in a bulleted list of non-negotiable requests for her return to filming. However, in his own complaint, Baldoni shut down the idea that he choreographed sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator.",
      "In his lawsuit, obtained by Fox News Digital, Baldoni explained an intimacy coordinator had been hired but that Lively had \"refused to meet\" with her. Baldoni included screenshots of text messages with a female producer to back up his claim. At the time, Baldoni had to meet alone with the intimacy coordinator to write the sex scenes and then relay the information to Lively.",

To suggest Baldoni was the one who created this scenario is knowingly false.\"",
      "\"Most egregiously, Lively later used these circumstances, created entirely by her, to accuse Baldoni of insisting Lively do \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 or \u2018gratuitous\u2019 scenes \u2013 scenes that were in fact proposed by the intimacy coordinator and by all accounts very typical asks of any actor performing simulated sex scenes. This is well-documented in handwritten notes Baldoni took during meetings with the intimacy coordinator and later read to Lively.\"",
      "According to Baldoni's team, Lively demonstrated an \"inability to discern the basic premise of the divide between collaborating on a film and personal interactions with her co-star and director,\" which can be seen throughout her sexual harassment allegations. In her complaint, obtained by Fox News Digital, Lively accused Baldoni of personally adding \"graphic content, including a scene in which Ms. Lively was to orgasm on camera.\"",

Lively remarked, \u2018oh no, I\u2019m too old for that\u2019 and Baldoni offered another suggestion instead, also from his notes from the meeting with the intimacy coordinator.

The six-week pre-boot camp, called the Future Soldier Prep Course, helps lower-performing recruits meet enlistment standards. They also moved away from just recruiting in high schools to posting on job message boards. Recruiters got trained by Amazon, Wells Fargo and other industry leaders in talent acquisition.

It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home.

      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",

Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

      "2. Use personal security caution: Don't sign in to anything using your social media accounts. Sign in with your email instead and be sure to use an email address you've set aside just for these kinds of situations.",
      "3. Do your homework online: Do an online search for the booking website, cruise line or travel agency in question, keeping an eye out for any recent reports of scams or other issues.",
      "4. Check company reputation carefully:\u00a0Check\u00a0ClassAction.org, the\u00a0Better Business Bureau and\u00a0Trustpilot specifically. This will help you gain comprehensive insights into a company's track record, customer experiences and potential issues.",
      "5. Verify communication legitimacy: Whenever you receive a call, email or text message from a booking service, confirm that it's really them by first checking your account directly and then contacting the company through official, publicly listed channels (not social media).",

      "1. Update all your apps and operating systems before heading off: All those security patches are that much more important while you're traveling. You'll want to download and install all pending updates at least 24-48 hours before your departure, ensuring you have the latest security protections and giving yourself time to troubleshoot any potential update-related issues that might arise.",
      "2. Lock everything down: Use strong, unique passwords and a reliable\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication where available: Prioritize using authenticator apps over SMS-based codes. This provides a more secure second layer of verification, as authenticator apps are less vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks and interception compared to text message-based authentication. Choose\u00a0reputable authenticator apps, which generate time-based one-time passwords that change frequently and are tied directly to your device.",
      "4. Keep location services turned off: NFC, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi should also be turned off while you\u2019re not using them. That\u2019ll make your battery last longer as a side benefit.",
      "5. Go dark: Don\u2019t publicly share news of your trip until you\u2019re back. Avoid posting about your vacation on social media or keeping a blog about your adventures, as this information can be used by criminals to piece together a snapshot of your life.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "6. Limit social media use:\u00a0Scammers and hackers often exploit social media to gather personal information and target travelers. To stay secure, avoid sharing trip details publicly and use a privacy-focused messaging app like\u00a0Signal to stay in touch with family and friends.",
      "7. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0You should consider using browsers like\u00a0Brave or Firefox with privacy extensions. Enabling \"do not track\" settings and utilizing private/incognito mode can provide an extra layer of digital protection.",
      "8. Disable automatic Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections: Disable settings that automatically connect to networks and manually select and verify networks before connecting. This prevents your device from inadvertently joining potentially unsecured networks.",
      "9. Use encrypted messaging and email: Protect your private communications by using services that offer end-to-end encryption for both\u00a0messaging and\u00a0email. These platforms ensure your data remains secure from unauthorized access, with features like encryption for non-users, multifactor authentication and tracking protection.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "10. Travel with minimal digital gear: Consider bringing a \"travel-only\" phone or laptop with minimal personal data.",
      "11. Be cautious of public charging stations: Avoid using\u00a0public USB charging ports that could potentially\u00a0compromise your device. Instead, carry a\u00a0portable phone charger with you.",
      "12. Monitor your accounts: Set up transaction alerts on financial accounts and use credit cards with strong fraud protection. Regularly check your accounts while traveling to quickly detect any suspicious activity.",
      "13. Bring your own internet access with you: Find a\u00a0local or international SIM, a\u00a0mobile hot spot and a trusted\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) service for those times you can\u2019t help but use public Wi-Fi. Using a VPN can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",

      "Whoosh pods are expected to achieve an average speed of 25 mph across the network. While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

Nestled between mountains and a lake, Queenstown suffers from limited road networks and significant traffic congestion, making it a perfect proving ground for Whoosh's innovative transportation solution. The pilot project will demonstrate the system's ability to navigate difficult terrain and provide efficient transit in a compact urban environment, with Chris Allington noting that the location is \"small enough that it's actually solvable\" while presenting unique geographical challenges.",

The Better Business Bureau has warned about fraudulent sports betting apps encouraging users to place \"guaranteed bets on upcoming games.\"",

      "Scoring last-minute Super Bowl tickets can feel like a victory until you find out they are fake. Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",
      "Scammers often utilize automation and artificial intelligence to identify and target potential victims based on the language used in their posts. For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets. They then respond to these posts with messages that contain links to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or Cash App, where they attempt to finalize fraudulent deals.",

These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",
      "The moment you enter your information or payment details, you have handed cybercriminals access to your bank account. And those free tickets or jerseys never arrive. Scammers rely on the excitement of game day to push people into acting without thinking. The truth is simple. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "Scam tactic #5: Offering massive discounts",
      "Finally, scammers may offer massive discounts for Super Bowl tickets to entice you to buy quickly. They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict. Scammers often use these excuses to pressure victims into making hasty decisions and transferring money without verifying the tickets.",

      "MOST TALKED ABOUT SUPER BOWL ADS",
      "Safeguarding your Super Bowl experience from cyber threats",
      "While scammers will try to prey on Super Bowl fans, you are not completely helpless. Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:00:55 -0500",
    "summary": "A new scam using Elon Musk&apos;s name is making the rounds, promoting &quot;energy-saving&quot; devices and falsely linking the Tesla and SpaceX leader to the products.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",

      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",

      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

      "Anne Bayefsky, the director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and the president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that the Action Plan was a \"phony exercise in futility,\" that was \"produced by what she claimed is the leading global purveyor of antisemitism\u2026to pretend to do something to combat antisemitism.\"",
      "Developed by the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), the U.N.'s Action Plan emphasizes that \"the ability to understand and identify antisemitism is crucial to global efforts to combat hatred and prejudice.\" Despite the critical nature of understanding antisemitism, the plan wholly fails to define what constitutes antisemitism.",
      "The Action Plan mentions, but does not adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which 45 member states have endorsed and which Bayefsky said \"the vast majority of major Jewish organizations and institutions around the world accept,\" because it \"recognizes the connection with Zionism and Israel.\"",

      "He said that Hamas was \"a good example of where the absence of a definition is problematic because you get something like the 10/7 attack\u2026and the U.N. just completely failed in its response to that, and that is partly because of its failure to judge that a group that adopts terrorist tactics is a terrorist group.\"",

      "Trump has said the United States needs control of Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal, for \"national security purposes.\" While Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama this week, Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino pledged to end his country's key Belts and Road project agreement with China. Trump had lamented Beijing's increased control of the strategic waterway, built by the United States, connecting the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.",

      "In Brussels on Monday, Frederiksen also reacted to Vice President JD Vance recently asserting that Denmark has \"not been a good ally.\" In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Vance repeated that Greenland is \"really important to our national security,\" as China and Russia increasingly traverse sea lanes near the island, and \"frankly, Denmark, which controls Greenland, it's not doing its job, and it's not being a good ally.\"",
      "\"You have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security if that means that we need to take more territorial interests in Greenland? That is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interests of America's citizens first,\" Vance said, adding, \"You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government. They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.\"",
      "Speaking in Danish, Frederiksen told reporters that Danes \"have fought side by side with the Americans for many, many decades,\" according to reports and an online translation.",
      "Prime Minister Frederiksen signaled that Denmark would welcome Trump sending more troops to Greenland, where the U.S. Space Force has a base to monitor missile threats. (Thomas Traasdahl/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"We are one of the United States\u2019 most important and strongest allies \u2013 and I will not accept the notion that Denmark is a bad ally. We are not, we never have been, and we never will be in the future. The Arctic Cooperation is important. It is something we are willing to prioritize,\" Frederiksen said, arguing that it would align with the interests of Denmark, the U.S. and NATO.",
      "\"It is sensible, but it is also important that we work together against terrorism, against the destabilization we see in the Baltic Sea right now with sabotage, and it is important that we work together on NATO\u2019s Eastern flank and thereby holding firm in relation to Russia,\" she added, turning to the Ukraine war. \"So we would be able to work together in many ways, but I do not want to be sitting on Denmark\u2019s name and remuneration that we should be a bad ally, because we are not.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement are under increasing pressure to boost the number of arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, as President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump has expressed anger that the\u00a0amount\u00a0of people deported in the first weeks of his administration is not higher, according to three sources familiar with the discussions at ICE and the White House.",
      "A source familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said the president is getting \u201cangry\u201d that more people are not being deported and\u00a0that\u00a0the message is being passed along to \"border czar\" Tom Homan, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi\u00a0Noem, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and acting ICE Director Caleb Vitello.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s driving him nuts they\u2019re not deporting more people,\u201d said the person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of the Biden administration\u2019s outright incompetence and negligence, the Trump administration has re-established a no-nonsense enforcement of and respect for the immigration laws of the United States,\u201d Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cHundreds of violent, predatory, and gang-affiliated criminal illegal aliens have already been rounded up and deported by ICE since President Trump took office \u2014 and the Trump administration is aligned on securing our borders and ensuring that mass deportations are conducted quickly and effectively to put Americans and America First.\u201d",
      "A source familiar with internal conversations at ICE said Homan has a daily conference call with ICE agents\u00a0in which\u00a0he has been known to express his frustration with ICE numbers.",

According to numbers ICE has posted\u00a0on X, the highest\u00a0single day total since Trump was inaugurated was just 1,100, and the number has fallen since that\u00a0day. On Tuesday of this week, arrests of immigrants were over 800, according to a source familiar with the numbers. But\u00a0last\u00a0weekend,\u00a0there were only about 300 arrests, another source told NBC News.",
      "In order to fulfill Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day promise of \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of deportations, the Trump administration would have to be deporting over 2,700 immigrants every day to reach 1 million in a year.",
      "And, as\u00a0NBC News has reported, arrests do not always equal\u00a0immediate detentions, much less\u00a0deportations. Of the more than 8,000 immigrants arrested in the first two weeks of the Trump administration, 461 were released, according to the White House."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is eying a committee vote next week to kickstart a massive multi-trillion-dollar package to advance President Donald Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.",
      "But first, Johnson needs to unify his small and fractious Republican majority before the House can even begin working on the bill.",
      "Johnson is eager to project imminent success as he faces pressure to get his ducks in a row from the GOP-controlled Senate, where the chamber's budget committee plans to move forward next week with a dueling resolution that takes a different approach.",
      "But House Republicans are divided on the parameters of a party-line bill that seeks to address tax, border and energy policy \u2014 from how much spending to cut, which programs to slash, how much red ink to add and how to structure a tax overhaul.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a few more people we\u2019ve got to talk with and a couple of boxes to check, but we are almost there. I\u2019m very encouraged by this,\u201d Johnson told reporters Friday. \u201cThe expectation is we\u2019ll be marking up a budget early next week, potentially as early as Tuesday, the resolution. And that will, of course, begin the process.\u201d",
      "Republicans are using an arcane process called budget reconciliation to bypass the 60-vote rule in the Senate and eliminate the need for Democratic votes.",
      "Johnson's remarks came one day after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt laid out an aggressive tax agenda from Trump, which includes extending his 2017 tax law (before it expires at the end of this year), eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits, \u201cadjusting\u201d the cap for state and local deduction, slashing taxes for domestic manufacturing and closing the carried interest tax perk.",
      "The nonpartisan Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based think tank, estimated that those provisions would add at least $5 trillion to the national debt \u2014 and, depending on how they\u2019re written, as much as $11.2 trillion.",
      "To pay for that, Republicans are eying a slew of spending cuts, although they're not even close to keeping the bill deficit neutral.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got $250 billion in student loan programs. You\u2019ve got these Medicaid work requirements. Potential SNAP work requirements. Clearly, stuff that is in the Inflation Reduction Act and the [electric vehicle] mandates,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told NBC News on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars in all of that.\u00a0And then there\u2019s other issues that are a little bigger that we\u2019ve got to go wrestle with.\u201d",
      "While some in the GOP want to downplay an estimated $4.6 trillion in new debt by extending the Trump tax cuts, Roy said, \u201cwe should be careful with things like that\u00a0\u2014 that can get kind of gimmicky.\u201d",
      "Democrats are blasting the emerging package as an attempt by Republicans to give tax breaks to the wealthy, at the expense of middle-class programs that may land on the chopping block.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing internal GOP civil war around the budget,\u201d said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. \u201cThey\u2019ve been kind of busy fighting amongst themselves around how big the tax cuts will be for their billionaire buddies, and how much they\u2019re going to cut out of Medicaid as part of their scheme to end it as we know it.\u201d",
      "Johnson was heading back home to Louisiana Friday afternoon and said he would be ironing out some final details and briefing Trump at the Super Bowl LIX on Sunday in New Orleans.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be with the president in the suite and this would be one of the big topics of discussion. So we need to keep the president and his team fully apprised on the developments we have been up to this point,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a few more developments today, so I\u2019ll be I\u2019ll be addressing that with him, and letting him know where we are.\u201d",
      "The speaker\u2019s comments came on the same day Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., rolled out text of his own budget resolution that calls for funding for border security, the military, and energy provisions. The panel plans to vote on it Wednesday and Thursday of next week, Graham said.",
      "But unlike the House\u2019s emerging plan, the Senate bill does\u00a0not\u00a0include a renewal of Trump tax cuts. GOP senators believe that will take longer and want to leave it for another time.",
      "\u201cThis budget resolution jumpstarts a process that will give President Trump\u2019s team the money they need to secure the border and deport criminals and make America strong and more energy independent,\u201d Graham said in a statement Friday.",
      "That creates another problem for Republicans: the committees of jurisdiction cannot begin to formally draft the bill until both chambers pass an identical budget resolution.",
      "Johnson said he\u2019d been playing phone tag with Graham for the past 36 hours and texted the senator Friday about how \u201cimportant\u201d it is for the House to go first on reconciliation.",
      "House Republicans want all of those same elements, as well as the Trump tax cuts, wrapped into a single reconciliation package, underscoring the split in strategy between the two chambers over how best to move forward on Trump\u2019s 2025 agenda.",
      "Both Johnson and House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said they are aiming for next week to debate and vote on a budget resolution in committee.",
      "\u201cI intend to mark it up next week. That\u2019s the intention, but we still have to work out details,\u201d Arrington told reporters Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna get in the details, because we\u2019re really close to getting it all figured out.\u201d",
      "The developments followed a series of closed-door GOP budget negotiations and an hourslong meeting between Republican lawmakers and Trump at the White House on Thursday.",
      "Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said he\u2019s largely supportive of the budget outline being discussed by Johnson and Arrington. But Norman said there are still some key outstanding issues.",
      "The hang-ups are \u201chow much spending cuts, what we\u2019re gonna put for growth rate, how we\u2019re gonna handle the limit on spending and all of that,\u201d Norman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re coming together with it.\u201d"

      "It took more than eight years for former Clinton administration adviser Elaine Kamarck to cut approximately 426,000 jobs, 16,000 pages and $136 billion \u2014\u00a0in 1990s dollars \u2014 from the federal government.",
      "So Kamarck, who ran the first phase of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Reforming Government (\u201cREGO\u201d) effort, understands the impulse to scrutinize the extent of Washington\u2019s spending excesses \u2014 and that it can be addressed.",
      "Yet Kamarck, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told NBC News that while the \u201cslash and burn\u201d approach currently being taken by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can work in Silicon Valley, it can cost actual lives when used to implement changes in government outlays.",
      "\u201cIf you apply that same slash and burn to air traffic control, or slash and burn to CDC investigating food poisonings, guess what: People die,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big f-----g deal. It\u2019s a completely different level of risk.\u201d",
      "Over the past week or so, Musk and his DOGE team have ignited a firestorm by highlighting \u2014 sometimes in false, misleading, or erroneous ways \u2014 government spending that may have come as a surprise to the American public.",
      "Reforming federal spending remains a perennial topic of Washington discourse, and a galaxy of agencies, think tanks and NGOs are dedicated to rooting out perceived bureaucratic excesses in the government\u2019s $7 trillion annual budget.",
      "Notably, the information DOGE has surfaced was already available to the public. For more than a decade, a digital tool, USASpending.gov, has been accessible to anyone who wants to learn, in surprisingly granular detail, most of what the U.S. government was spending money on,\u00a0and in what amounts.",
      "Yet the political environment is such that the Musk-led DOGE team now feels emboldened to push through radical changes, arguing that the end justifies the means.",
      "\u201cAlthough it is a humorous name, ironically I think DOGE will have a very serious and significant impact on government waste and fraud and abuse \u2014 which is really astonishing,\u201d Musk said in a recent audio-only event on X, his social media platform.",
      "In addition to showing federal agencies\u2019 payments for news sites subscriptions \u2014 information that DOGE has caused to go viral with deceptive context \u2014 the USASpending.gov site shows the\u00a0largest individual government expenditures that were active over the past 12 months\u00a0but may which may have started earlier.",
      "These include approximately $50 billion to health care group Humana, which helps run the military\u2019s TRICARE health program; roughly $50 billion to Lockheed Martin; about $38 billion to a group that manages Oak Ridge National Laboratory; approximately $36 billion to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; and the group that manages Los Alamos National Laboratory. The laboratories alone focus much of their research on energy and national security solutions.",
      "Few would call the necessity of those programs into question. Indeed, Musk and DOGE have set their initial sights instead on USAID, a relatively obscure agency that provides critical funding for programs abroad and whose budget accounts for approximately 1% of all government expenditures.",
      "As Musk brings to light examples of spending at USAID that may not have relevance to most Americans\u2019 daily lives, the effort, so far, seems to belie his goal of finding trillions of dollars in federal savings \u2014 though he has indicated the DOGE mission is only just getting started.",
      "Kamarck said it is clear the DOGE team has started off looking for \u201cquick wins\u201d \u2014 not least because Trump has just four years left in office. But, he said, using databases to find specific funding elements to cut may not ultimately yield much.",
      "Kamarck said a better target would be Medicare and Medicaid spending, which has historically been riddled with fraud, she said. (DOGE employees have reportedly become embedded in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.)",
      "Most federal agencies, including USAID, have employed an inspector general tasked with rooting out waste and malfeasance. There are other checks, too: Since its establishment in 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Medicare Fraud Strike Force has clawed back more than $4 billion in payments while filing nearly 3,500 criminal indictments.",
      "Yet Trump appears to have viewed many inspectors general as ineffective at best, having fired 18 of them within days of taking office, including at the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "DOGE\u2019s methods may also be breaking laws. Courts have begun imposing injunctions on some of the DOGE efforts. The White House asserts Musk has abided by \u201call applicable laws\u201d while exercising a maximalist view of the powers of the executive branch.",
      "\u201cLet me just start by saying that DOGE was a promise that President Trump campaigned on,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week. \u201cHe campaigned alongside Elon Musk and was very vocal about the fact that he would be appointing Elon \u2014 or tasking Elon \u2014 with this very important role of putting together the Department of Government Efficiency.\u201d",
      "DOGE has drawn the ire of Democrats. Late Wednesday, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., gave a floor speech applauding any effort to examine spending profligacy while decrying the DOGE approach. He pointed out that his DATA Act, passed in 2014, established the first-ever way to track every dollar of U.S. government spending online via USASpending.gov.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s ways to save spending, count me in,\u201d Warner said. But he said he opposed giving DOGE employees access to sensitive personal information, as well as the ability to potentially alter previously apportioned payments themselves.",
      "\u201cWhy would you give someone \u2014 a coder \u2014 the potential keys to the kingdom of the United States Treasury?\u201d he asked.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the bipartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, says she has some sympathy for what the DOGE team is trying to do.",

      "Vice President JD Vance\u2019s White House portfolio is coming into sharper focus.",
      "President Donald Trump has tapped Vance,\u00a0along with National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, to oversee a deal to sell and save TikTok, the Chinese social media company facing a ban in the U.S., two people familiar with the arrangement told NBC News.",
      "The assignment, first reported by Punchbowl News, tops a longer list of tasks Vance is tackling.",
      "His week began in his native Ohio, where, on the second anniversary of the toxic East Palestine train derailment, he committed the administration to completing cleanup efforts and defended Trump\u2019s call for tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. It continued with Vance nudging his former Senate colleagues to support a pair of Trump\u2019s most controversial Cabinet nominees. And it ended Friday with Vance calling for the rehiring of a Department of Government Efficiency staffer who resigned after the Wall Street Journal surfaced racist remarks he had made online.",
      "Up next week: the first overseas trip of Vance\u2019s vice presidency, with an itinerary that includes an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and the Munich Security Conference in Germany.",
      "\u201cSome of the biggest priorities in front of the president the president has looked to JD to support and advance,\u201d said a senior White House official, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking. \u201cEven the most complicated deals he trusts JD to help support.\u201d",
      "Another White House official, asked to grade Vance\u2019s performance so far, gave him an \u201cA.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s portfolio is instructive of how and where the White House is most confident deploying him three weeks into Trump\u2019s term. He\u2019s trading on his relationships on Capitol Hill while representing the administration in crisis areas domestically and at meetings abroad.",
      "\u201cI play the role that the president needs me to play, whether it\u2019s casting the tie-breaking vote or maybe talking to some of my old Senate colleagues about the importance of voting on this nomination,\u201d Vance said in an interview this week with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo. \u201cI sort of see my job as an all-around player. When I played Pee-Wee football, you would sometimes get a trophy, \u2018Mr. All Around,\u2019 for the kids who played offense and defense.\u201d",
      "Vice presidencies can be complicated to navigate. Dan Quayle is remembered more for his blunders. Al Gore struggled to emerge from Bill Clinton\u2019s shadow. More recently, Kamala Harris received several high-profile but tricky assignments, including immigration and abortion. Her term serves as a cautionary tale of how a specific policy portfolio can mutate into a political liability.",
      "\u201cJD\u2019s role in the White House is simple,\u201d a source close to Vance said. \u201cHis role is to get stuff done for President Trump whenever President Trump thinks he can be helpful. \u2026 He\u2019s not demanding a portfolio. These are not little things that JD is being entrusted with.\u201d",
      "Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump State Department appointee, noted that Vance is playing to strengths he honed as a senator and on the campaign trail last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a skilled communicator and MAGA translator \u2014 not just to the base, but to the Senate at large,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cHe looks the part, has a pronounced presence on social media.\u201d",
      "The East Palestine trip was a throwback for Vance, who represented Ohio in the Senate and strengthened his bond with Trump when advising him on how to respond to the train derailment there two years ago. With Vance at his side, Trump visited the village weeks after the disaster. Trump and his team later would assign a cosmic significance to the trip, regarding it as the moment that his 2024 presidential campaign found its footing after a rough start.",
      "\u201cWe are committed not just to finishing the environmental side of the cleanup, but hopefully seeing East Palestine build back better and stronger and more prosperous than it was before this disaster happened in the first place,\u201d Vance said there Monday, flanked by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, village firefighters and state and local officials. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen overnight. Of course, I\u2019m a realist about this, but I just want the people to know here that President Trump, me and the entire administration are committed to ensuring that the people of East Palestine that \u2026 their government does right by them.\u201d",
      "The senior White House official praised Vance for accepting assignments without complaint or reservation \u2014 and without demanding a specific lane or area of interest to own.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been all things to all people in a way most can\u2019t fulfill,\u201d this person said. \u201cEverything from leading from certain policy dealmaking to helping usher through the Cabinet picks to blitzing the media and doing Sunday shows \u2014 he\u2019s proven there\u2019s nothing he\u2019s unwilling or unable to do.\u201d",
      "On the Cabinet front, Vance has emerged as Trump\u2019s eyes, ears and voice in the Senate, where he served for two years. His existing relationships with fellow Republicans in the chamber came in handy during the messy confirmation battle for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed only after Vance\u2019s tie-breaking vote. More recently, Vance helped swing two key GOP votes in the fights over Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s nominees for Health and Human Services secretary and director of national intelligence, respectively.",
      "\u201cI want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., wrote Tuesday in a post on X after announcing that he would vote in favor of Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "That same day, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., declared his support for Gabbard and similarly credited Vance. Young told reporters that he sought reassurances about \u201cnational security gaps\u201d and that Vance \u201cgot me those requested answers.\u201d Young and the vice president engaged in extensive conversations to secure Young\u2019s commitment, a source familiar with his decision said.",
      "\u201cI think all of us who have served with JD have had conversations with him,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who added that she had sought out Vance for a discussion on the tariff issue. \u201cI\u2019ve talked with him, for example, about the difference between our relationships with Canada, which is very important to my state, versus our relationship with Mexico and China.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Vance\u2019s travel next week will give him an opportunity to build his foreign policy credentials ahead of his own anticipated presidential run in 2028. (\u201cWe\u2019ll cross the political bridge when we come to it,\u201d Vance told Bartiromo, who pressed him this week on his future plans.)",
      "Trump\u2019s antagonistic stance toward NATO allies and his approach toward Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine rate as key points of concern abroad. In an interview this week with Breitbart News, Vance said he would approach the AI summit in Paris as an opportunity to chat with other world leaders about finding a diplomatic way to \u201cbring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close.\u201d",
      "As for the Munich Security Conference, Harris represented the Biden administration at last year\u2019s event in an effort to reassure those nervous about the prospect of Trump\u2019s return to power. Vance heads there with a reputation that precedes him as an opponent to Ukraine aid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s probably nobody better to send into that world,\u201d Bartlett said of Vance, a Yale Law School graduate who worked in venture capital before entering politics. \u201cThis is somebody who speaks and understands MAGA, yet has the similar degrees and maybe even business acumen that the rest of the room has.\u201d",
      "Bartlett added: \u201cWhen the liberal elites get together and mock Trump, his policies and the way he talks, it is JD Vance that serves as that bridge that can illustrate to them, maybe even educate them, precisely what the Trump administration is talking about, and do it in ways that are much more understood than mocked.\u201d"

      "After seven days of deliberations, a jury in December acquitted tech consultant Nima Momeni of first-degree murder in Lee\u2019s April 4, 2023, killing.",
      "\u201cI felt a ringing in my ear,\u201d Scout Lee, 16, told \u201cDateline\u201d in her first interview about her father\u2019s death and the murder trial. \u201cI just felt so overwhelmed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI grabbed onto my mom\u2019s hand and squeezed it and cried,\u201d she added.",
      "For more about the case, tune in to \u201cUnder the Bay Bridge\u201d on \"Dateline\" at 9 ET/8 CT tonight.",
      "Scout \u2014 who described herself as her father\u2019s \u201cmini me\u201d \u2014 said she felt some relief when, moments after the acquittal was announced, Momeni was convicted of the lesser crime of second-degree murder.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it was the type of justice that I wanted,\u201d she said, adding that in her view, prosecutors had presented overwhelming evidence that the murder was premeditated.",
      "The San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office accused Momeni, 40, of committing the murder after his sister told him she\u2019d been sexually assaulted by a man who Lee introduced her to.",
      "That man, Jeremy Boivin, was never charged in the alleged assault. In his first interview since the trial, Boivin denied the allegation to \u201cDateline\u201d and said he never assaulted Momeni\u2019s sister, Khazar Momeni.",
      "During the trial, which began in October, Momeni testified that he was defending himself when he mortally wounded Lee. He faces a prison term of 16 years to life and plans to appeal his conviction.",
      "Momeni's sentencing is set for May 16.",
      "A night of partying turns deadly",
      "Lee, 43, founded the popular money transfer service Cash App and was an executive at Square and Mobile Coin. He was stabbed three times with a paring knife under the Bay Bridge, east of downtown San Francisco. One of the wounds punctured his heart, San Francisco Police Sgt. Brent Dittmer told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "Lee called 911 around 2:30 a.m. and asked for help dozens of times before collapsing in front of a nearby apartment building, according to audio of the call and security video. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.",
      "In the aftermath of Lee\u2019s death, some \u2014 including Elon Musk \u2014 blamed the killing on what they described as out-of-control violent crime in San Francisco. (The city saw a rise in homicides in 2020 and 2021, though that number has since fallen to a near-historic low.)",
      "Authorities rejected the assertion \u2014 San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins called it \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d \u2014 and said the killing had been done by someone Lee knew.",
      "At trial, prosecutors said that Momeni was furious after his sister alleged that she\u2019d been assaulted during a small get-together at Boivin\u2019s apartment on April 3. Khazar Momeni, who\u2019d been friends with Lee for nearly a decade, testified that the alleged assault occurred while she was high on cocaine, LSD and GHB, a depressant linked to date rape and sexual assaults.",
      "She testified that Boivin slapped her butt while her pants were down and she was unable to move.",
      "Boivin did not testify at Momeni\u2019s trial. In an interview, he acknowledged that he smacked her bottom but said he\u2019d done so \u201ccasually.\u201d He and Khazar Momeni had a physical relationship for months after that event, Boivin said.",
      "\u201cSo her saying these allegations is just baseless and really unfounded,\u201d he told \u201cDateline.\u201d",
      "After the alleged assault, Khazar Momeni testified, she told her brother about what she said happened.",
      "A tense phone call between Nima Momeni and Lee followed. The call was overheard by a friend of Lee\u2019s who later described the conversation to authorities.",
      "\u201cHe is interrogating Bob,\u201d San Francisco Assistant District Attorney Omid Talai told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cHe is questioning him about what was happening\u201d at the apartment.",
      "In the hours after the call, Lee met with Nima and Khazar Momeni at her home. At trial, prosecutors accused Nima Momeni of taking a paring knife from his sister\u2019s kitchen, where investigators later found the same brand of blade used in Lee\u2019s killing.",
      "Authorities had found the 3 \u00bd-inch knife after following a blood trail from the apartment building where Lee collapsed to a fence a half-block away, Dittmer said. The blade was on the other side of the fence.",
      "Momeni\u2019s defense team described Lee\u2019s death as an act of self-defense prompted by Lee\u2019s drug-fueled bender.",
      "Momeni testified that he\u2019d initially been upset about his sister\u2019s allegation of sexual assault, but after speaking with several people who'd been at Boivin's apartment, he said he came to believe her account was likely an exaggeration. After he met with Lee at his sister\u2019s place, Momeni testified, the two planned on hanging out together at a strip club.",
      "They did cocaine together, Momeni testified, and while en route to the club, Momeni said Lee spilled a beer he'd been drinking. After pulling over to clean up the mess, Momeni testified, Lee found \"whippit\" canisters in the back seat and began inhaling nitrous-oxide.",
      "When Lee said he thought he was going to throw up, Momeni ribbed Lee, asking the executive why he was going out to strip clubs instead of being with his family at home, Momeni testified.",
      "\"That\u2019s when the conversation went from normal to adversarial,\" Momeni's lawyer, Saam Zangeneh, told \"Dateline.\"",
      "According to Momeni\u2019s account, the comment enraged Lee, who was divorced and living in Miami but visiting San Francisco. Momeni testified that Lee lunged at him with a knife, prompting Momeni to grab Lee\u2019s arm and accidentally push the blade toward his chest.",
      "Momeni testified that he left the scene believing Lee was fine.",
      "The pain of the courtroom",
      "Scout attended parts of the trial and described it as agonizing. The audio from her father\u2019s 911 call, she said, \u201cjust keeps ringing in my head.\u201d",
      "Her older brother, Sirius Lee, believed he could handle seeing high-resolution security video of his father collapsing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty strong when it comes to just not showing emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more and more I had to sit through that, the more and more I felt like I was going to genuinely pass out.\u201d",
      "Sirius knew about his father\u2019s drug use, he said, but it never made him feel unsafe.",
      "Scout was less aware of Lee\u2019s vices, she said, and it was hard to see him portrayed in a manner at odds with the person she\u2019d always known.",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just some party animal that was going out like every single night,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my dad.\u201d",
      "To her, Lee was a dedicated father who always helped with homework and had an approach to parenting that made her feel safe and calm. His death had been especially hard, she said, because in the days before he was stabbed, he\u2019d traveled to San Francisco to see her perform in a play.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the biggest roles that I ever had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he was just hugging me and congratulating me on doing a good job.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:25:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Nitrous oxide sold in colorful tanks with candy-like flavors that consumers are inhaling to get high is creating a \u201cveritable national health crisis,\u201d a lawsuit says.",
    "story": [
      "Nitrous oxide sold in colorful tanks with candy-like flavors that consumers are inhaling to get high must be removed from shelves because it is creating a \u201cveritable national health crisis,\u201d a new lawsuit alleges.",
      "Filed Thursday in state court in Orange County, Florida, by the family of a woman who died after what relatives said was a yearslong addiction to the gas canisters, the lawsuit accuses manufacturers and smoke shops of exploiting a legal loophole that allows them to sell nitrous oxide canisters if they are marketed as a culinary tool rather than an inhalant. The gas is most commonly used to make whipped cream.",
      "Nonetheless, the products are sold in large packages labeled and decorated \u201cso as to encourage their use through inhalation, and distributed through smoke shops, to further facilitate their use as recreational drugs, rather than cooking utensils,\u201d reads the lawsuit. \u201cThis presents a mortal danger to consumers\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese products have caused widespread addiction, death and severe bodily harm,\u201d the lawsuit adds.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the family of Margaret Caldwell, 29, who went by Meg and lived in Clermont, Florida. Relatives who spoke exclusively to NBC News said Caldwell was inhaling nitrous oxide hundreds of times a day and insisted it must not be dangerous because it was so easy to buy.",
      "\u201cShe would tell us, I\u2019m buying this legally. I\u2019m not doing anything wrong with this,\u201d said Kathleen Dial, Caldwell\u2019s sister and the plaintiff named as the representative of Caldwell\u2019s estate in the suit. \u201cThat was a really hard thing to conquer with her, that thought process, because it was so readily available.\u201d",
      "The defendants listed in the complaint could not immediately be reached for comment. One defendant, Galaxy Gas, paused direct sales in September after videos circulated on social media appearing to show young people inhaling from its cylinders. A spokesperson at the time said the company was \u201cdeeply concerned about the recent news reports and social media posts of individuals illegally misusing our products.\u201d NBC News has reached out to Galaxy Gas for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Galaxy Gas has a pop-up message on its website that says that the product is solely intended for culinary purposes and warns consumers about the dangers of misusing it. Consumers must click to acknowledge the \u201ccondition of sale\u201d before viewing the website, which has hundreds of recipes the flavored gases can be used in to aerate or infuse ingredients, including a citrus nitro margarita, a pesto cream sauce and strawberry mousse.",
      "Often referred to colloquially as \u201cwhippets,\u201d nitrous oxide canisters are sold in many smoke shops across the country as well as online from major retailers, with some states restricting sales to people 21 and over.",
      "Nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, is used as a sedative in medicine. In recent years, there has been an uptick in its use as an illicit recreational drug that gives users an immediate, brief euphoria when they inhale it. From 2023 to 2024, there was a 58% increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide, data from America\u2019s Poison Centers\u2019 National Poison Data System shows.",
      "Repeated nitrous oxide usage is associated with\u00a0symptoms of\u00a0vitamin B12 depletion, according to Dr. Cara Borelli, a physician specializing in addiction medicine at Yale School of Medicine. She said that can\u00a0include\u00a0cognitive and coordination problems and psychiatric issues.",
      "Caldwell had been a top student growing up. Before her addiction took hold starting in her mid-20s, she enjoyed skiing, horseback riding and spending time with her nieces and nephews, her parents and sisters said.",
      "Caldwell tried various rehabilitation facilities, but she always returned to nitrous oxide \u2014 even after she temporarily lost the use of her legs in September 2024 from what a doctor told her was an overdose of the gas, her family said.",
      "\u201cThe doctor said, \u2018You are going to die if you keep using this drug,\u2019\u201d said another sister, Leigh Caldwell. \u201cAs soon as she got back on her feet, she went back to the smoke shop and got the drug again.\u201d",
      "Caldwell died in November 2024 in the Orlando area. Her body was found behind an Orange County smoke shop where she had purchased nitrous oxide products, according to the lawsuit. Her family said an autopsy report is still pending.",
      "The complaint is not a wrongful death lawsuit. Rather, it\u2019s a proposed defendant class action against the seven Florida smoke shops that Caldwell frequented \u2014 a rare type of litigation against a small number of defendants that aims to tackle industrywide practices. The suit does not seek damages but simply to have the product immediately removed from store shelves. It is also a proposed class action lawsuit against major nitrous oxide manufacturers and seeks damages for families impacted by nitrous oxide addiction.",
      "Both the proposed defendant class action suit and the proposed class action suit against the manufacturers will need to be certified by the court to proceed.",
      "Mike Morgan, an attorney at injury law firm Morgan & Morgan who is representing the family, compared what\u2019s happening with nitrous oxide products to Juul, the vaping brand that was accused of using fruity flavors and youth marketing tactics to contribute to a vaping epidemic among adolescents, an allegation that Juul has vehemently denied. The Food and Drug Administration ordered Juul to stop selling e-cigarettes in 2022, though they stayed in stores pending an appeal, and the FDA reversed its ban last year.",
      "\u201cThe type of flavor add-ons are very similar to what we\u2019ve seen recently with the tobacco crackdown on different vaping products,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWhen you are adding raspberry and cotton candy, the only purpose that can be used for is to make it more palatable to the taste, to make young people want to use it.\u201d",
      "While the state of Louisiana and some local jurisdictions have banned retail nitrous oxide sales, there is no federal restriction on it. The FDA said it oversees nitrous oxide only in certain circumstances.",
      "\"The FDA does not have jurisdiction over nitrous oxide that is intended for industrial uses, but it does have jurisdiction over nitrous oxide for certain medical uses and for food use,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"Recreational use of nitrous oxide poses serious safety risks,\" the statement added.",
      "Caldwell\u2019s family members are hopeful that their lawsuit will prevent other families from experiencing the same pain that they have.",
      "\u201cIt has been devastating losing Meg. It\u2019s left a big hole for all of us,\u201d said her mother, Joy Plumley-Caldwell. \u201cThis won\u2019t bring her back, but if it could make something positive come out of it, we would be so grateful.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know is struggling with an alcohol, drug or other substance abuse problem, call the free and confidential helpline of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 1-800-662-HELP (1-800-662-4357), or visit findtreatment.gov."

      "Many of Ye's posts centered on the Jewish community, the most severe of which said, \"I love Hitler\" and \"I'm a Nazi.\"",
      "In an early post, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m never apologizing for my Jewish comments. I can say whatever the f--- I wanna say forever. Where\u2019s my f------ apology for freezing my accounts.\u201d",
      "He followed that with saying Jewish people \u201cdon\u2019t run me no more.\u201d In one post,\u00a0he wrote: \u201cSome of my best friends are Jewish and I don\u2019t trust any of them,\u201d followed by a laughing crying emoji.

      "Another said: \u201cI love when Jewish people come to me and say they can\u2019t work with me anymore its my fav.\u201d",
      "Ye has had his X, previously known as Twitter, account suspended at least twice in the past.",
      "His account was suspended in December 2022 after he made antisemitic comments and praised Hitler. Musk, the owner of X, said at the time Ye's account would be suspended after he posted an image that appeared to show a swastika inside a Star of David. Musk said the suspension was \u201cfor incitement to violence.\u201d The account was unsuspended by July 2023.",
      "In October 2022, Ye's\u00a0account was restricted\u00a0over antisemitic comments but he\u00a0returned to the platform\u00a0the following month. In that case, he also made antisemitic remarks that led to Adidas\u00a0cutting ties with the rapper.",
      "Ye's Friday morning maelstrom of posts also touched on other topics, including his wife, Elon Musk and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "He spoke on the look of his wife, Bianca Censori, at the Grammy's \u2014 a see-through dress \u2014 writing: \u201cI have dominion over my wife. This ain\u2019t no woke as feminist s---.\u201d",

I have no respect or empathy for anyone living cause no one living can f--- with me but I do love some people and I give them favor.\u201d",

      "Combs, who is in federal custody and being held in Brooklyn, was\u00a0indicted in the Southern District of New York in September\u00a0on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs has denied all the allegations against him to date, which include the federal criminal case and\u00a0more than 30 civil lawsuits\u00a0filed against him.",
      "Ye also said that every post he writes \"promotes Elon's platform.\" Another post on Musk said: \u201cElon stole my Nazi Swag at the Inauguration.\u201d",

      "A Louisiana woman with a history of \"drugging men\" and stealing their credit cards was arrested after the death of a TV reporter who was New Orleans for the Super Bowl, police said Friday.",
      "Hotel security video showed Danette Colbert, who lives in nearby Slidell, with Kansas City Telemundo's Adan Manzano, 27, and entering his room at 4:35 a.m. Wednesday, Kenner police chief Keith Conley told reporters.",
      "Detectives discovered that the credit card Manzano used to check into the Comfort Suites wasn't on his body or in the hotel room, according to Conley.",
      "Colbert used Manzano's credit card \"at several stores in the New Orleans area,\" Kenner police said in a statement.",
      "Colbert has been \u201ccharged with property crimes, including fraud and theft-related offenses,\" though \"this investigation remains ongoing,\" according to the police statement.",
      "Kenner police have not said how Manzano died.",
      "\"You asked if this was a homicide, I don't know where it's going to end up. We're going to let the evidence lead us to the end result and not speculate,\" Conley said.",
      "\"As soon as the coroner finishes with his findings and they will classify it as either homicide or whatever death the evidence leads him to and then these charges could be upgraded.\"",
      "The suspect has an arrest record \"that includes allegations of drugging men, theft of currency, fraudulent use of credit and debit cards, and other financial crimes,\" said Kenner police, which asked that \"anyone who may recognize Danette Colbert and has any information regarding her involvement in these crimes to call\" investigators.",
      "In 2022 in Nevada, police said Colbert was \"charged with introducing a substance, a foreign substance\" into a victim, Conley said, \"and the other one was in Jefferson Parish, I believe it was two years ago.\"",
      "Colbert was booked on suspicion of simple robbery, access  device fraud, illegal transmission of monetary funds, bank fraud and computer fraud, the police chief said.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear Friday afternoon if Colbert had hired or been assigned an attorney to speak on her behalf.",
      "Manzano's death came just months after his wife, Ashleigh Boyd, was killed in a car crash in Topeka, officials said.  Boyd, 24, was a second-grade teacher with Topeka Public Schools.",
      "The couple has a young daughter who survived the car crash."

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 23:37:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The Black national anthem \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d has sparked social media-fueled backlash in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
    "story": [
      "More than a century after the NAACP adopted \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d as the \u201cBlack national anthem,\u201d the song has sparked social media-fueled backlash in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Rep. Lauren Boebert said on X that there\u2019s \u201cONE NATIONAL ANTHEM.\u201d Another critic called the song, which speaks to resiliency and the prospect of better days for an oppressed people, a \u201cBlack supremacy\u201d song. Still another called it \u201cracist and divisive.\u201d Some Black conservatives have also said the song should not be performed at the game, calling it \u201ca desperate Hail Mary to exploitation\u201d and that it \u201cfoments racial divides and animosity.\u201d",
      "This will be the fifth consecutive Super Bowl to feature the song in the pre-game ceremony, each time seeming to draw disagreement about whether it is appropriate. This year, its performance by Ledisi comes amid increasing rejections of antiracism messaging and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in many facets of American life, from sports to corporate boardrooms to the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe performance of the song should be framed to the public not as a protest song but as a song of Black affirmation, perseverance and inspiration,\u201d said Gerald Early, the pop culture essayist who teaches in the African and African American studies department of Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the song\u2019s performance has become a culture war issue.\u201d",
      "There was a similar outcry last year when Audra Day performed the legendary song before the NFL\u2019s ultimate game. This year, however, the controversy aligns with the first few weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and him signing \u00a0hundreds of executive orders, some of which aim to dismantle DEI in the federal government and beyond.",
      "Still, having \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d performed is not an indictment or remonstration on the league \u2014 or a political statement, Early said. \u201cFeelings might be running a bit more strongly on this issue since Donald Trump won the election decisively and he has always been opposed to this sort of thing.\u201d",
      "James Weldon Johnson, a civil rights activist and NAACP leader, wrote it initially as a poem in 1900, and later collaborated with his younger brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, a musician, to transform it into a song now celebrated by Black people across the country.",
      "Ken Knuckles, a music teacher for more than 25 years in Lithonia, Georgia, described it as a \u201cpowerful, inspirational song.\u201d He said he has taught the song countless times to students as young as middle schoolers.",
      "\u201cAnd they sing it the way it\u2019s supposed to be sung: with pride,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the words. Words have power and this song is about achievement. The song means the world to people of color. It reflects how long we had to struggle to get where we are now. The song is inspiring and aspiration.\u201d",
      "During a news conference this week, Ledisi said she was honored to sing the song on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in alignment with greatness to stand in this moment and sing that song,\u201d said the Grammy-winning artist. \u201cI\u2019m used to this in my career, standing in moments, representing the past and the future and the current state of the world. I\u2019m used to that pressure. I just remember who I\u2019m doing it for. I remember my ancestors. I remember everyone waiting for this moment to feel hopeful and to feel represented.\u201d",
      "While the NFL has not indicated whether it will stop allowing \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d before the Super Bowl, the league has started expanding its endzone stencils, which began in 2020 with \u201cEnd Racism\u201d after protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "This year\u2019s Super Bowl at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, touchdowns will be scored in front of the message, \u201cChoose Love.\u201d Early said this change may have political implications.",
      "\u201cThe problem the NFL is facing is that once you begin to advertise socially conscious messages, you offend people who don\u2019t want to be preached to while watching sports,\u201d he added. \u201cThey go to sports to escape politics, not to get more of it.\u201d",
      "Trump, who will attend Sunday\u2019s game, is pushing corporations to end DEI programs, with many conservatives backing his play. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said this week that DEI policies have improved the league and that the organization remains committed to it.",
      "Early emphasized that Black players make up about 53% of the athletes in a league that was integrated in 1946.",
      "A recent Associated Press survey of 65 Black NFL players indicated many are disappointed that 11 franchises have never hired a Black coach. And the concerns about the lack of Black coaches overall have existed for more than 40 years.",
      "In 2016, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality of Black men and, with Trump leading the discourse against him, never played in the league again.",
      "Early said people\u2019s response to the Black national anthem is similar to criticism of Kaepernick a decade ago.",
      "\u201cSome who are opposed to \u2018Lift Every Voice and Sing\u2019 think of it as another protest or as a protest song and couple it with Kaepernick\u2019s protest,\u201d he said. They are, more than likely, \u201csick of protests associated with American sports and American entertainment generally.\u201d"

      "In what was arguably the game's biggest play, the Bills called a quarterback sneak \u2014 which quarterback Josh Allen had converted for a first down 20 of 21 times in the 2024 season before the conference championship.",
      "Allen, as he\u2019d done for most of the season, took the snap and tried to find room to his left. Kansas City\u2019s defense was waiting and stuffed him short of a first down \u2014 or at least mucked up the play enough that a replay review couldn\u2019t determine whether Allen had reached the line to gain.",
      "That stop was the fourth time in the game the Chiefs had rebuffed Allen on designed sneaks, holding him to 2-for-6 on such plays.",
      "But trying to stop Allen in short yardage was only a warmup for Kansas City\u2019s defense, which now faces the NFL\u2019s Final Boss of quarterback sneaks: the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 \u201ctush push.\u201d",
      "The Eagles have been running the tush push \u2014 a quarterback sneak in which Jalen Hurts gets help from running backs behind him \u2014 with great success going back to 2022, including at the Chiefs\u2019 expense.

      "Against Buffalo, Kansas City was able to have success in part because of tendency. Allen favored running to his left on sneaks, something multiple Chiefs coaches and players mentioned after the game. Kansas City\u2019s defense cheated in that direction in short yardage, and it paid off. (In fact, Allen\u2019s second and final conversion on a sneak in the AFC championship game occurred when he dove over the top as opposed to running left.)",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret,\u201d Spagnuolo said when he was asked how he can stop the sneak. \u201cThe secret is probably in trying to have 11 rugby players on your team who can push it the other way.\u201d",
      "Spagnuolo isn\u2019t fully joking about the rugby angle, by the way. In true coaching fashion of leaving no stone unturned, Spagnuolo said he has actually had conversations with rugby coaches about how they would try to stop the tush push, which he equates to something more like a scrum than a football play.",
      "How Kansas City defends the tush push will almost certainly be a key factor in Sunday\u2019s game. The Chiefs, after all, learned firsthand how valuable it is to take away that offensive weapon against the Bills.",
      "Whatever Kansas City ends up doing, defensive coordinators leaguewide will be watching as they try to come up with answers against what has been an unstoppable play. While Spagnuolo has looked to rugby coaches for advice, he hasn\u2019t exactly done the same when he speaks with his fellow coordinators.",
      "\u201cWhen we all get together, we all go, \u2018I wish they would get rid of this play,\u2019\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cWe were hoping they were going to outlaw it, so we still got to deal with it.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 23:37:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The Black national anthem \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d has sparked social media-fueled backlash in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
    "story": [
      "More than a century after the NAACP adopted \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d as the \u201cBlack national anthem,\u201d the song has sparked social media-fueled backlash in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl in New Orleans.",
      "Rep. Lauren Boebert said on X that there\u2019s \u201cONE NATIONAL ANTHEM.\u201d Another critic called the song, which speaks to resiliency and the prospect of better days for an oppressed people, a \u201cBlack supremacy\u201d song. Still another called it \u201cracist and divisive.\u201d Some Black conservatives have also said the song should not be performed at the game, calling it \u201ca desperate Hail Mary to exploitation\u201d and that it \u201cfoments racial divides and animosity.\u201d",
      "This will be the fifth consecutive Super Bowl to feature the song in the pre-game ceremony, each time seeming to draw disagreement about whether it is appropriate. This year, its performance by Ledisi comes amid increasing rejections of antiracism messaging and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in many facets of American life, from sports to corporate boardrooms to the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe performance of the song should be framed to the public not as a protest song but as a song of Black affirmation, perseverance and inspiration,\u201d said Gerald Early, the pop culture essayist who teaches in the African and African American studies department of Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the song\u2019s performance has become a culture war issue.\u201d",
      "There was a similar outcry last year when Audra Day performed the legendary song before the NFL\u2019s ultimate game. This year, however, the controversy aligns with the first few weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House and him signing \u00a0hundreds of executive orders, some of which aim to dismantle DEI in the federal government and beyond.",
      "Still, having \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d performed is not an indictment or remonstration on the league \u2014 or a political statement, Early said. \u201cFeelings might be running a bit more strongly on this issue since Donald Trump won the election decisively and he has always been opposed to this sort of thing.\u201d",
      "James Weldon Johnson, a civil rights activist and NAACP leader, wrote it initially as a poem in 1900, and later collaborated with his younger brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, a musician, to transform it into a song now celebrated by Black people across the country.",
      "Ken Knuckles, a music teacher for more than 25 years in Lithonia, Georgia, described it as a \u201cpowerful, inspirational song.\u201d He said he has taught the song countless times to students as young as middle schoolers.",
      "\u201cAnd they sing it the way it\u2019s supposed to be sung: with pride,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the words. Words have power and this song is about achievement. The song means the world to people of color. It reflects how long we had to struggle to get where we are now. The song is inspiring and aspiration.\u201d",
      "During a news conference this week, Ledisi said she was honored to sing the song on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in alignment with greatness to stand in this moment and sing that song,\u201d said the Grammy-winning artist. \u201cI\u2019m used to this in my career, standing in moments, representing the past and the future and the current state of the world. I\u2019m used to that pressure. I just remember who I\u2019m doing it for. I remember my ancestors. I remember everyone waiting for this moment to feel hopeful and to feel represented.\u201d",
      "While the NFL has not indicated whether it will stop allowing \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d before the Super Bowl, the league has started expanding its endzone stencils, which began in 2020 with \u201cEnd Racism\u201d after protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "This year\u2019s Super Bowl at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, touchdowns will be scored in front of the message, \u201cChoose Love.\u201d Early said this change may have political implications.",
      "\u201cThe problem the NFL is facing is that once you begin to advertise socially conscious messages, you offend people who don\u2019t want to be preached to while watching sports,\u201d he added. \u201cThey go to sports to escape politics, not to get more of it.\u201d",
      "Trump, who will attend Sunday\u2019s game, is pushing corporations to end DEI programs, with many conservatives backing his play. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said this week that DEI policies have improved the league and that the organization remains committed to it.",
      "Early emphasized that Black players make up about 53% of the athletes in a league that was integrated in 1946.",
      "A recent Associated Press survey of 65 Black NFL players indicated many are disappointed that 11 franchises have never hired a Black coach. And the concerns about the lack of Black coaches overall have existed for more than 40 years.",
      "In 2016, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality of Black men and, with Trump leading the discourse against him, never played in the league again.",
      "Early said people\u2019s response to the Black national anthem is similar to criticism of Kaepernick a decade ago.",
      "\u201cSome who are opposed to \u2018Lift Every Voice and Sing\u2019 think of it as another protest or as a protest song and couple it with Kaepernick\u2019s protest,\u201d he said. They are, more than likely, \u201csick of protests associated with American sports and American entertainment generally.\u201d"

      "An Ohio city that was racked with chaos and threats last year related to an influx of Haitian immigrants filed a lawsuit on Thursday against a neo-Nazi group that it alleges was at the heart of the onslaught.",
      "The city of Springfield, Mayor Rob Rue and several others sued the Blood Tribe, its leaders Christopher Pohlhaus and Drake Berentz and seven unnamed followers in U.S. District Court in Dayton.",
      "They accuse the group of \u201cengaging in, and inciting, a campaign of harassment and intimidation, motivated by ethnic and racial hatred, against those who supported Springfield\u2019s Haitian community in the face of Defendants\u2019 racist attacks.\u201d",
      "With legal help from the Anti-Defamation League, the plaintiffs are asking the court for a jury trial seeking to block the group from making further threats and to impose damages.",
      "The court file did not list an attorney for the Blood Tribe. Messages were left at phone numbers listed under Pohlhaus\u2019 and Berentz\u2019s names.",
      "Springfield, a city of roughly 60,000 west of Columbus, has seen its Haitian population grow to about 10,000 people in recent years, as Haitians have fled violence in their home country in search of stability and employment. Their growing numbers have caused friction with local residents, as schools, roads, hospitals and social programs have been taxed by the large population \u2014 and, particularly, after a child was killed in 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driver hit a school bus.",
      "As a candidate, Republican President Donald Trump honed worldwide attention on the city, during a September presidential debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris, when he amplified false claims that Springfield\u2019s Haitians were abducting and eating people\u2019s pets.",
      "The complaint alleges that the Blood Tribe first coordinated a \u201chit\u201d against the city in July, calling the influx of Haitians an \u201cinvasion\u201d that was threatening Springfield\u2019s \u201cgood White residents.\u201d",
      "\u201cMembers of the Blood Tribe heeded the call,\u201d the filing said. \u201cOver the next few months, the Blood Tribe and its members and associates unleashed a torrent of hateful conduct, including acts of harassment, bomb threats, and death threats, against Springfield residents who spoke out in support of the Haitian community.\u201d",
      "Members of the group showed up at the city\u2019s jazz and blues festival in August, according to the court document, displaying guns, waving swastika flags and wearing matching red shirts, black pants and ski masks. They made their way to City Hall, where Drake Berentz, identified as a leader of the group, delivered a \u201cracist and antisemitic rant,\u201d to which followers responded with chants of \u201cSeig Heil\u201d and Nazi salutes.",
      "Additional actions the lawsuit alleges against the group included harassing voicemails, hateful emails and social media posts demeaning the plaintiffs and their families. The complaint says that group members also used dating apps to send men looking for drugs and sex to the residents\u2019 homes late at night and publicized their personal information with the intent of getting others to join in the harassment.",
      "The lawsuit describes actions attributed to the Blood Tribe that began before and continued after the Trump-Harris debate. It makes no direct reference to Trump\u2019s remarks, but notes that Pohlhaus \u201cgleefully took credit for the growing notoriety\u201d of the false claims as they spread around the world.",
      "Shortly after the debate, the leader of a national advocacy group for Haitians sought to invoke a private-citizen right to file criminal charges against Trump and his then-running mate JD Vance over the chaos and threats experienced by Springfield. A panel of local judges decided in October to refer the matter to the county prosecutor for further investigation, rejecting the Haitian Bridge Alliance\u2019s call to issue arrest warrants or misdemeanor summonses to both men.",
      "The group awaits a decision on an appeal it has filed in the Ohio Supreme Court. The action alleges that Clark County Municipal Court Judges Valerie Wilt, Daniel Carey and Stephen Schumaker \u201cpatently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction\u201d to meet as a group as they did when making the referral. The lawsuit is pending."

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:55:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The legality of the Trump administration\u2019s buyout offer is shrouded in uncertainty as questions remain over whether it is even valid without Congress\u2019 approval.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of federal workers face a looming deadline to decide whether to accept the Trump administration's unprecedented buyout offer, questions remain over whether the plan is even valid without Congress\u2019 approval, according to interviews with federal law and labor experts.",
      "More than 60,000 employees have already agreed to resign as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to rapidly reduce the government workforce, with more being coaxed to take the deal ahead of a Monday deadline.",
      "That same day, a federal judge in Boston is expected to hear arguments over the merits of the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d program, which is being challenged by several labor unions.",
      "\u201cI think this program is likely to be struck down,\u201d said Justin Schnitzer, a managing partner at Fedelaw, a Maryland law firm that specializes in federal employment cases. \u201cYou see, in some of these emails, the administration says workers who take the buyout can \u2018go on their dream vacation,\u2019 things like that \u2014 but that\u2019s clearly not how Congress appropriated funds.\u201d",
      "Stephanie Rapp-Tully, a partner at the law firm Tully Rinckey who practices federal employment law, said the administration is making claims it can\u2019t guarantee.",
      "\u201cThe government cannot promise future pay if it\u2019s not authorized or appropriated by Congress,\u201d Rapp-Tully said. \u201cThat\u2019s a major concern.\u201d",
      "Congress hasn\u2019t appropriated funding beyond March 14, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms unless a bipartisan deal can be reached amid Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda to unilaterally reshape the government.",
      "The initial Jan. 28 email, with the subject line \u201cFork in the Road,\u201d was directed toward roughly 2 million federal employees deemed eligible for \u201cdeferred resignation.\u201d The pitch: If they reply with the word \u201cresign,\u201d they will be exempted from all in-person work requirements and can continue collecting salaries and earning benefits through Sept. 30.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, an office in the Trump administration focused on slashing government spending, attempted to appeal to workers, writing on X: \u201cCan take the vacation you always wanted, or just watch movies and chill, while receiving your full government pay and benefits.\u201d",
      "But in\u00a0a memo\u00a0Tuesday from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management attempting to assure employees the offer is \u201clegally binding,\u201d officials appeared to tamp down on the idea of a sudden vacation for all participants.",
      "\u201cThose assurances are binding on the government,\u201d the memo adds. \u201cWere the government to backtrack on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation.\u201d",
      "The memo said most employees would be expected to assist with \u201ctransition\u201d duties and would then be \u201cplaced on administrative leave for the bulk of the deferred resignation period.\u201d The memo later clarified, \u201cThe decision to grant administrative leave, and for how long, lies largely within the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d",
      "And in a sample agreement included in the memo, employees must agree to certain terms, including that only an agency head can rescind the agreement, except under limited circumstances, and an employee \u201cforever waives, and will not pursue through any judicial, administrative, or other process, any action against\u201d their agency.",
      "If the government decides not to pay employees who chose to resign under the program through the promised Sept. 30 date, it\u2019s unclear whether they would have any rights to seek what they were promised, Rapp-Tully said.",
      "\u201cThe agreement that was sent out as a draft agreement at most agencies has language in it that requires waiver of any and all claims, so that calls into question whether there can be any sort of challenge to the enforceability,\u201d Rapp-Tully said.",
      "Debra D\u2019Agostino, founding partner of the Federal Practice Group in Washington, D.C., who leads the firm\u2019s federal employment law team, said the details in the agreement must be carefully reviewed by potential takers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s notable that, at first, it was just \u2018respond to this email and you\u2019re all set,\u2019 but then, as the week went on, they sent out that template agreement that looks much more like a typical severance agreement,\u201d D\u2019Agostino said. \u201cI think that agreement demonstrates more understanding from both parties as to what would be involved. It says employees would be waiving any and all claims, even claims they don\u2019t know they have right now but maybe should know.\u201d",
      "Workers in at least one agency, the Education Department, were told that if they accept the resignation package, the education secretary may later cancel it and employees would not have any recourse, potentially leaving them without promised pay. A new education secretary has not yet been confirmed.",
      "Some employees across the federal government who spoke with NBC News expressed anguish over taking the deal by the original Thursday deadline. With just hours to spare, U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. paused the program pending a hearing on Monday to weigh arguments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scam and not a buyout,\u201d Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said following the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., praised the judge\u2019s decision and argued the Trump administration has \u201cno clear authority to offer this deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cRecent reporting has indicated that the Trump Administration added clauses to the deal that allow the Administration to cancel it at any time, leaving federal employees without pay, as well as requiring federal employees who accept the so-called buyout to waive their rights to any legal recourse,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The OPM denied its program was being blocked or canceled, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded in a statement that the administration was still pressing ahead: \u201cWe are grateful to the Judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the Administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer.\u201d",
      "Legal experts contend it will be an uphill battle for employees who may have buyer\u2019s remorse having signed the agreement.",
      "\u201cUsually, when someone resigns from a job, there are no legal avenues, unless there are unique circumstances like they were legally compelled to do it,\u201d Rapp-Tully said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this will be interpreted as anything other than voluntarily. If the government doesn\u2019t follow through or doesn\u2019t make the payment, someone could rescind their resignation \u2014 but would the government be compelled to reinstate the employee? I\u2019m not sure they would be.\u201d",
      "Tom Spiggle, a Washington, D.C., employment lawyer, said he\u2019s been fielding multiple calls from government workers asking him about taking the offer. The agreement, he said, may be enforceable \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ve signed a contract\u201d \u2014 but workers should know that \u201cthe government still holds all the cards.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re relying on the good graces of Elon Musk and the administration that they can really get this done,\u201d Spiggle said."

    "summary": "The Trump administration is moving forward with restarting the detention of migrant families, including those with young children.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is moving forward with restarting the detention of migrant families, including those with young children, which could mean an increase in arrests of children and teens, according to three sources familiar with the planning.",
      "The sources said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is preparing to publish in the coming days a \u201cRequest for Proposal\u201d that will ask private prison companies to bid for contracts to restart detention facilities intended specifically for families.",
      "The Obama and first Trump administrations detained parents with their children, but the Biden administration ended that in early 2021. Under the terms of a 1997 court settlement, ICE is prohibited from holding families with children in regular ICE detention settings and must hold them for less than 21 days.",
      "The Biden administration allowed undocumented immigrant families making their way through the immigration system to live in the United States while the head of the household was enrolled in a geolocating monitoring program, such as through an ankle monitor, even if the family was slated to be deported.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office again last month, most of the arrests by ICE that have been publicized have been of single adult men.",
      "That could soon change once family detention centers are brought back online. The two existing facilities ready to take in migrant families are in Karnes, Texas, which has previously been run by GEO Group and has the capacity to hold over 3,000 people and in Dilley, Texas, which can hold up to 830 people and was previously run by Core Civic, according to the facilities\u2019 web sites.\u00a0Dilley is currently closed but being maintained while Karnes is currently holding adult ICE detainees and would have to change over to a family facility again.",
      "It is not clear if ICE intends to build new capacity or simply reopen previous family detention centers. Either way,\u00a0ICE already faces a budget shortfall, and this will be an additional cost. Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Two former DHS officials under the Biden administration said there are tens of thousands of migrants in the U.S. who are part of families in the and who have final orders of removal, meaning that once arrested they could\u00a0be fast tracked to detention and then deportation after arrest. That could help ICE boost its deportation numbers, something the agency is under pressure to do now given that Trump made \u201cmass deportations\u201d a key campaign promise.",
      "One of the former officials also cautioned that many families in the United States are mixed-status, meaning some members are in the country legally while others are eligible for deportation. Families in that situation could be separated if some members are deported. In an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October, Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan said no exceptions would be made for mixed status families, but that people in the country legally could choose to be deported to keep their family together."

      "Those programs along with others are part of the complex web of U.S. global assistance that addresses humanitarian needs and helps mitigate migration to the United States and other countries, by helping people become self-sustaining.",
      "The Trump administration has excoriated USAID programs as fraught with waste and abuse as they've virtually dismantled the agency, with President Donald Trump on Friday calling for it to be \"shut down.\" But those who have worked with USAID programs say they've had a role in preventing some migration \u2014\u00a0and could help Trump accomplish his goals of slashing illegal entries into the U.S. and controlling the border.",
      "\u201cWhat drives migration is lack of opportunity, lack of health services, a decent quality of life and knowing you can have a better one in a different place,\u201d said an official with knowledge of the USAID partnered program in Colombia that helps employ Venezuelans. He did not want to be identified for fear the program could be targeted.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge ordered a temporary pause of the Trump administration's planned administrative leave for thousands of USAID employees.",
      "Most Venezuelan refugees have migrated to other countries in Latin America: As of November, Colombia had taken in the most at about 2.8 million, according to the Interagency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants. By contrast, about 600,000 Venezuelans are in the U.S. under temporary protected status, which Trump is eliminating.",
      "Migration is usually a product of many factors: economic downturns, political persecution, increased insecurity, violence perpetrated by criminal syndicates or domestic violence, along with a desire for better educational and economic opportunities, family ties and even love and marriage.",
      "But Trump has added a new push factor by cutting off money to programs that may have helped people in other countries survive or overcome those factors, according to people who work with relief groups.",
      "\"We have no problem with people saying I want to review this program. I think it's good and necessary,\" said Gabriel Salguero, pastor of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition who has participated in humanitarian assistance programs in many countries.",

      "Salguero said his group\u2019s phone line has been flooded with calls from people in the U.S. who help support the faith-based nonprofits around the world.",
      "\"Historically poverty has contributed to migration. Poverty and hunger contribute. I go back to the book of Genesis, there was a famine and God had to lead Joseph ... I don\u2019t think Jesus was playing around when he said, 'I was hungry and you gave me to eat,'\" Salguero said.",
      "Sustaining an \u2018economic chain\u2019 \u2014 and helping stem migration",
      "Emily Chambers Sharpe, director of global health and communications for World Relief, a Christian humanitarian group that receives USAID funding, said the group has procured about 4.3 million tons of seeds for beans that were about to be distributed to farmers to be planted.",
      "\u201cIf the farmers can plant those and get their crops, then they have food security; it\u2019s not so tempting to move away,\u201d Chambers Sharpe said.",
      "She's also met with fishermen in Haiti who \u201ctalked about how this assistance helps them prepare for hurricanes and cyclones that move through, and again, it helps keep people in Haiti, which is a hard place to want to stay in,\u201d she said.",
      "Those farmers and fishermen take their products to market and farmers can put aside seeds for next season, so the program provides longer-term support.",
      "Not getting the seeds or the fishing tools \u201ccuts them out of the economic chain when they are not able to get their supplies\u201d in time, Chambers Sharpe said.",
      "In his first term, Trump questioned the migration of people from Haiti, El Salvador and African nations, referring to those as \u201cshithole\u201d countries. In 2021, with President Joe Biden in charge, tens of thousands of Haitians arrived at the U.S. border, fleeing their country's political instability and violence. Controversy ensued when U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback tried to drive out some who had already crossed the border. A Department of Homeland Security investigation found some agents used unnecessary force.",
      "Catholic Relief Services, which receives USAID funding, makes the connection between its work and migration in a document on its website that describes reasons people migrate from Central America to the U.S. It cites family-owned businesses being extorted by gangs and drug lords, young people left jobless because their neighborhoods are controlled by criminals, natural disasters and worsened climate conditions.",
      "\"CRS\u2019 work in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador addresses the root causes of flight to the U.S. We protect kids against trafficking, keep children in school and help youth stay out of gangs in some of the toughest neighborhoods,\" the document states. \"Programs like YouthBuild, for example, provide life, job skills and entrepreneurship training to youth who might otherwise be on the streets.\"",
      "The USAID overhaul is happening while there have been dramatic declines in arrivals at the southern border, a slide that began in the end of Biden\u2019s administration but that is significantly greater than in similar periods last year. As of Jan. 27, according to a U.S. official, the number of Southwest border encounters was 813, down from 833\u00a0the week before and compared with an average of 1,552 during the month of December.",
      "\"President Trump can simultaneously secure the southern border while identifying wasteful spending across the federal bureaucracy,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to NBC News. \"He will cut programs that do not align with the agenda that the American people gave him a mandate in November to implement and keep programs that put America First.\"",
      "Curbing violence, reducing migration",
      "The Pares Foundation, a nonprofit in Colombia focused on national reconciliation, was created following a peace accord in 2016 between the country\u2019s government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group.",
      "Years of clashes between FARC and Colombia\u2019s government contributed to Colombian migration to the United States. While peace between the two factions has made Colombia more stable, the country is still struggling.",
      "Laura Bonilla, the foundation\u2019s deputy director, said the organization, which received USAID funds, is \"very worried about this.\"",
      "Bonilla, who was tasked with monitoring the peace deal and post-conflict, said that during the initial negotiations between 2014 and 2016, as well as during the first part of the implementation of the peace agreement, Colombia had the lowest rate of violence and displacement in decades.",
      "\u201cAt that moment, migration was lower because people had a lot of expectations and hope that the situation was going to be better,\u201d Bonilla said. \u201cIf you have a country with lower rates of violence, then people don\u2019t want to emigrate.\u201d",
      "Latin America and the Caribbean receive\u00a0far less aid than other regions. In 2023, the region received $100 million, compared with  $1.6 billion for sub-Saharan Africa and $1.5 billion for Europe and Eurasia, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who now oversees USAID, has issued a waiver to Trump\u2019s executive order pausing USAID to allow continuations of\u00a0\u201clife-saving humanitarian assistance programs.\u201d",
      "Rubio has said that USAID did not cooperate with the administration in identifying programs that align with U.S. foreign policy, so the State Department is now combing through programs to find the ones that further national interests and end those that don't.",
      "\"This is not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,\" he said at a recent news conference in Guatemala.",
      "\"Not only is this a good idea, we owe it to the American taxpayer because this is taxpayer money. This is not a charity,\" he said.",
      "But Rubio's waiver prohibits migration and refugee assistance programs that provide lifesaving humanitarian aid and support repatriation of people to their country of origin or a third country, such as immigrants deported from the United States. It prohibits any programs it labels \u201cgender or DEI ideology programs, transgender surgeries or other non-life saving assistance.\u201d",
      "While Rubio's waiver may be allowing some of the work to restart, it also has program leaders scrambling to apply for waivers for programs, even as they may be laying off staff because money to pay them has been stopped.",
      "Chambers Sharpe said some groups had completed contracts and the next step was to report the completion of a program to USAID so the contractor could be paid, but with most of the staff at USAID on leave and its headquarters shut, there is no way to get those payments and no one to help them work through a contract or waiver process.",
      "The USAID program official who did not want to be identified said the prohibition on DEI programs also is confusing. Many of the poorest people or those most subjected to violence are from the LGBTQ, Afro Latino or Indigenous communities or are women. The help they give them is not predicated on their identity, but is focused on them because they are the most vulnerable.",
      "\u201cIf we have a women\u2019s job program, is that DEI?\u201d the official asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d",

He\u2019s appointed more federal judges than any president since my grandfather. He ended our longest war. He ended the Covid pandemic, and he ended Donald Trump. These are the issues that matter,\" Jack Schlossberg said, adding, \"And if my cousin, Bobby Kennedy Jr., cared about any of them, he would support Joe Biden too.\"",
      "He continued, \u201cInstead, he\u2019s trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame. I\u2019ve listened to him. I know him. I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president. What I do know is his candidacy is an embarrassment. Let\u2019s not be distracted again by somebody\u2019s vanity project.

      "Some characters on the show, including disgraced wellness influencer Belle Gibson (played by Kaitlyn Dever), are inspired directly by real people, with their names left unchanged. Other key characters are fictional amalgamations of people in Gibson\u2019s orbit, like Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Carey).",
      "For years, the real Gibson said she had cured herself of terminal brain cancer using a natural diet and other alternative healing methods. She built a platform as an Instagram influencer and a wellness entrepreneur with a successful app, Whole Pantry, and accompanying cookbook.",
      "In reality, though, Gibson never had cancer at all.",
      "When she admitted to the truth in a 2015 interview with Australia\u2019s The Weekly, her downfall was swift. In addition to lying about her diagnosis, Gibson had claimed a \u201clarge part\u201d of her company Whole Pantry\u2019s earnings would go to charities or good causes, which was not the case, per\u00a0a\u00a0court action\u00a0from the Federal Court of Australia in 2017.",

      "What has the creator of 'Apple Cider Vinegar' said about the true story?",
      "For Samantha Strauss, the show\u2019s writer and creator, it\u2019s important for viewers to know that \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d is a \u201ctrue-ish\u201d representation of Gibson\u2019s fraud, and that the intent of the show was never to give the real Gibson a platform.",
      "Strauss says she\u2019s never met Gibson, and says she used \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World\u201d as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for her story.",
      "\u201cIt really became a jumping off point for us,\u201d she tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Belle talked about in real life, I can only speculate what motivated her. And so this is our fictional account.\u201d",
      "She also explains why the show ends shortly after Gibson\u2019s scam is revealed, rather than exploring where the real Gibson is now.",
      "\u201cI liked the idea of ending Belle in, I would say, a fragile place of hope,\u201d Strauss\u00a0says.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she\u2019s learned not to do this again, you know, maybe she won\u2019t repeat the cycles of her own past.\u201d",
      "Strauss adds that as far as she knows, Gibson has never paid a fine or gone to jail for her actions.",
      "\u201cIn lots of ways, social media was her punishment,\u201d she says.",
      "In September 2017, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Gibson\u00a0to pay $410,000 in relation to her \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d",
      "As of early 2020, Gibson had still not paid the fine, according to the\u00a0Australian Associated Press, via The Guardian. Gibson\u2019s home\u00a0was raided in 2021.",

      "Belle\u2019s boyfriend in the show, Clive Rothwell, played by Ashley Zuckerman, appears to be based on a real person.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Rothwell is an IT consultant from Adelaide, Australia, which closely mirrors his character on the show.",
      "Gibson described Rothwell as her housemate and friend in a 2019 court hearing, per\u00a0The Guardian.",
      "In the miniseries, Rothwell is seen beginning to question Gibson\u2019s illness. However, he backs off because he wants to stay involved in the life of Gibson\u2019s young son.",
      "This appears to be creative speculation on the show\u2019s part; the real Rothwell has never spoken publicly about whether he was aware of Gibson\u2019s cancer deception, and about the nature of any private conversations they may have had about her health.",

      "Which \u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 characters are fictional?",
      "Some characters in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are fictional, though they appear to be at least partly inspired by people who encountered Belle Gibson.",
      "The character of Milla Blake, a wellness influencer who claims she cured herself of cancer using natural methods, is an \u201camalgamation of wellness influences at the time,\u201d Alycia Debnam-Carey, who played Milla in the series, told TODAY.com.",
      "Debnam-Carey says \u201cparallels can be made\u201d between Milla\u2019s character and Jess Ainscough, an Australian influencer known to her supporters as \u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Similar to what is shown in Milla\u2019s storyline, Ainscough found lumps on her arm in her early 20s and was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Doctors advised her to amputate her left arm at her shoulder, but she declined this surgery and tried chemotherapy instead. This worked temporarily, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "When the cancer recurred a year later, Ainscough decided not to amputate, and instead searched for alternative healing methods. She ended up devoting herself to Gerson therapy, a controversial regimen developed in the 1920s that claims to \u201cdetoxify\u201d the body through methods including a clean diet, juicing and frequent coffee enemas.",
      "According to multiple studies from The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, Gerson therapy has \u201cdemonstrated no benefit\u201d and \u201ccannot be recommended\u201d to people with cancer, and in some cases may have adverse effects.",
      "Ainscough gained a large following as she posted about her wellness journey on social media, and in 2013 she released a bestselling book, \u201cMake Peace With Your Plate.\u201d",
      "Seven years after she was first diagnosed with cancer, Ainscough died at 29 in 2015.",
      "Milla\u2019s story in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d has close parallels with Ainscough\u2019s life, and the controversial Hirsch Institute Milla attends in Mexico seems to be a fictionalized version of the Gerson Institute.",
      "However, their stories diverge in places. In the show, Milla is shown as turning away from conventional medical treatments from the beginning. Ainscough\u2019s family, however, has said she was willing to try chemotherapy at first.",
      "\u201cIt has \u2026 been said that Jess shunned conventional treatment and doctors, this \u2026 is incorrect,\u201d her family said in a tribute to Ainscough shared by Australia\u2019s The Sunshine Coast Daily.",
      "Still, while there are several similarities between Ainscough and Milla, Debnam-Carey says Milla\u2019s character was invented as someone who could go \u201ctoe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat parallel dynamic of the two of them was such an interesting story,\u201d she said. \u201cBelle is someone who\u2019s lying to the world, but Milla is sort of lying to herself, but also convinced that she\u2019s done this to herself, that she\u2019s caused the cancer that\u2019s in her.\u201d",
      "The character of Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), a woman with breast cancer who is inspired by Belle\u2019s social media posts, is also fictional.",
      "The show\u2019s creator, Samantha Strauss, describes Lucy as \u201cthe heart of the show,\u201d and says Lucy represents the many people who were influenced by Gibson\u2019s messaging.",
      "\u201cLucy\u2019s us,\u201d Strauss tells TODAY.com. \u201cLucy is the people who could suffer because of people like Belle.\u201d",
      "While Lucy is fictional, her story shares similarities with Kate Thomas, who is featured extensively in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Like Lucy, Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 30s. As she underwent chemotherapy, she came across Gibson on social media and was drawn to her discussion of alternative treatment methods.",
      "\u201cTo see that she had gone through this, but had done it the natural way, was inspiring,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano for their book. \u201cShe gave hope to people like me that maybe we didn\u2019t have to put ourselves through such intense treatment. Maybe we could survive.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 partner, Nik Donaldson, was skeptical of Gibson\u2019s claims, according to the book, which mirrors the dynamic between Lucy and Justin on the show.",
      "After learning about Gibson\u2019s scam, Thomas said she felt betrayed and furious on behalf of people who had abandoned proven medical treatments based on Gibson\u2019s advice.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how she can live with herself,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano. \u201cPeople would be saying, \u2018You\u2019re such an inspiration, I\u2019ve decided not to do chemo\u2019 \u2026 Belle would have been reading those comments and knowing that people were stopping treatment. That is not OK.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Thomas decided to continue with conventional treatment. In May 2024, an interview with Thomas in Australia\u2019s Geelong Advertiser stated that Thomas was at that time \u201cclear of cancer.\u201d",
      "Actor Aisha Dee describes her character Chanelle as \u201ca voice of reason\u201d who \u201crepresents the audience in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s kind of seeing things in the same way that I think you see it when you\u2019re watching it on your TV at home,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Gibson did have a friend named Chanelle in real life who was interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d but their stories have some differences.",
      "The Chanelle character in the show works with both Milla Blake and Gibson.\u00a0There is no evidence that the real Chanelle did the same.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Chanelle did challenge Gibson about her cancer claims, and recalled a time Gibson faked a seizure at her son\u2019s birthday party, as shown in the series."

    "summary": "Louie Zakarian, head of the \"Saturday Night Live\" makeup department, takes the TODAY show behind the scenes as the show celebrates 50 years.",
    "story": [
      "When Heidi Gardner broke character and busted out laughing in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch that became an instant classic, it was as much a triumph for the show's makeup department as the writers and cast members.",
      "Guest host Ryan Gosling and \"SNL\" cast member Mikey Day had Gardner laughing uncontrollably when they were clad in wigs and prosthetics to look like animated '90s icons Beavis and Butt-Head in an episode on April 13, 2024. Day's exposed gums as Butt-Head particularly had Gardner losing it.",
      "That was the work of the 20 artists on the show's Emmy-winning makeup team led by Louie Zakarian, who has been building elaborate prosthetics on the show for nearly 30 years.",
      "Zakarian gave NBC's Joe Fryer a look behind the curtain on TODAY in a segment that aired Feb. 7, just over a week ahead of the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special.",
      "The ace makeup team that creates the bald caps, facial hair and intricate prosthetics often doesn't even start making them until Thursday and sometimes Friday each week.",
      "They also only have a few minutes to either put them on or take them off the cast members once the live episode starts on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s choreographed mayhem,\" Zakarian told Fryer. \"It\u2019s like a pit crew.\u00a0Everybody knows what they have to do. Everybody knows where they have to be at any given moment, and we can get them in and out of that chair within minutes.\u201d",
      "In one recent episode, cast member Sarah Sherman went from having a prosthetic attached to her nose for a sketch about a dog park to transforming into a 92-year-old woman in a matter of minutes for another sketch.",
      "\"It\u2019s happening to me, and I don\u2019t even know how it\u2019s happening,\" Sherman said on TODAY about the rapid transformations.",
      "A crucial part of the process is making \"lifecasts\" of every host and cast member. It's what allows Zakarian and his staff to pull off transformations like putting dog noses on 10 cast members in 10 minutes for the dog park sketch during a live episode.",
      "The \"lifecasts\" are now done with high-tech scanners that can map a person's face in minutes. A 3D printer is then used to turn the scans into a mold of the person's face.",
      "Fryer demonstrated the process by having a scan and mold of his own face done in just minutes.",
      "They all hang up in what is known as the \"mold room\" for NBC and \"SNL.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s stuff here that\u2019s older than I am,\" Zakarian said.",
      "Illustrating his point, Zakarian showed off the rudimentary mold of the bald heads for the classic \"Coneheads\" sketches that first appeared on the show in 1977, way before the days of high-tech scanners.",
      "\"Now to have them in my hands and be able to reproduce them, it\u2019s one of those dream-come-true moments, you know what I mean?\u201d Zakarian said.",
      "Famous faces of every host from Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson to Eddie Murphy hang on the walls along with classic prosthetics like the one Zakarian made for the late Phil Hartman's \"Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer\" sketches in the 1990s.",
      "Last year, the makeup department returned to the '90s for the \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" sketch that had Gardner hilariously breaking character.",
      "\"It went crazy,\" Zakarian said.",
      "The department is a favorite of Sherman, who believes their creations help her better get into character. Zakarian worked on the prosthetics during this current \"SNL\" season when Sherman played the vampire Nosferatu in reference to the recent movie of that title.",
      "\"Once I have really long vampire fingers, then and only then can I finally actually figure out what the voice is of the character,\" Sherman said on TODAY.",
      "Fryer said on TODAY that Zakarian told him that one crucial directive from legendary showrunner Lorne Michaels is that the cast member is still recognizable underneath the prosthetics.",
      "It's not only the \"SNL\" cast members who benefit from the creations of the makeup department. Zakarian and his team also are the ones who help make the costumes and prosthetics that are on display every year during TODAY's show-stopping Halloween extravaganzas.",
      "Their latest creations are sure to be a big part of \"SNL's\" 50th anniversary celebration, which airs Feb. 16 on NBC and streams on Peacock.",

      "Dorinda Medley",
      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\""

      "Has 'Sweet Magnolias' been renewed for Season 5?",
      "Not yet, but that\u2019s typical for Netflix. The streaming service announced that \u201cSweet Magnolias\u201d was returning for Season 4 a few months after Season 3 debuted, so it\u2019s likely that viewers will get some answers in the near future.",
      "When would Season 5 of 'Sweet Magnolias' premiere?",
      "There was almost a two-year break between the third and fourth seasons of \u201cSweet Magnolias,\u201d but the 2023 Hollywood strikes involving\u00a0SAG-AFTRA and WGA were likely a factor in the delay.",
      "Season 4 was in production between February and May 2024 and premiered eight months later. If the show is renewed for Season 5 in the first few months of 2025, it's likely that viewers won't see another season for at least another year when you factor in writing, filming and post-production.",

Meanwhile, Helen and Erik (Dion Johnstone) were basking in the bliss of their post-engagement glow and Dana Sue and Ronnie (Brandon Quinn) took the first steps toward exploring a new business opportunity.",
      "Romance was in the air for Noreen (Jamie Lynn Spears) after Jeremy (Chase Anderson) invited her and her daughter to move in with him. Isaac (Chris Medlin) also had a new love interest.",
      "Annie (Anneliese Judge) and Ty\u2019s (Carson Rowland) budding relationship hit a snag when Annie got accepted into art school in California and he was set to go on tour in Europe.",
      "What could happen in Season 5 of 'Sweet Magnolias'?",
      "If \u201cSweet Magnolias\u201d fans are lucky enough to see a fifth season of the series, the next installment of episodes would likely explore Maddie\u2019s new life in New York City (if she actually does decide to move forward with the new job). Wedding bells would likely be in the air for Helen and Erik, making that a focal point of a potential next season.",
      "Of course, diehard fans are also eager to see what happens to Annie and Ty\u2019s relationship. A fifth season would likely follow them as they both pursue their passions on separate continents and decide if they can make their relationship work."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for the United States to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cdevelop\u201d the Gaza Strip have handed jihadist terrorist groups a rallying cry to recruit and inspire attacks against Americans at home and abroad, security experts and former intelligence officials say.",

      "\u201cI think every CIA station chief in the Middle East woke up this morning with a migraine headache, because there\u2019s a potential for a generational counterterrorism nightmare here,\u201d Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who worked in the region, said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"",
      "Polymeropoulos highlighted the language Trump has used in recent days \u2014 that the United States would \"take over\" and \"own\" Gaza.",

      "Israel launched an invasion of Gaza after Hamas militants staged a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians. More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting in the enclave, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The Islamic State and other jihadist extremists have seized on the Gaza conflict and the suffering of Palestinian civilians as material for propaganda and to encourage attacks on governments painted as enemies of Muslims, said Lucas Webber, senior threat analyst at Tech Against Terrorists, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\u201cThis most recent development will hypercharge these existing trends and provide fodder for the Islamic State to tap into it and leverage it to build support, empower its rhetoric, recruit and even incite violence,\u201d Webber said.",
      "Pro-ISIS propagandists have already started to highlight Trump\u2019s comments on social media, portraying his language as a vindication of their labeling the United States as an enemy of Muslims, according to Webber.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cliterally bulletin board recruiting material today for our terrorist enemies, whether or not we ever go into Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to clear Gaza out of Palestinians, that drives young men to extremist groups, to violence, to groups that are based around violence,\u201d Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"",
      "The White House has defended Trump\u2019s comments, saying he has shown a willingness to question conventional wisdom about the Middle East and scored a breakthrough in his first term by securing an agreement between Israel and four Arab countries to establish diplomatic ties.",
      "Brian Hughes, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the same lawmakers and former officials now criticizing the president once \u201cclaimed the Middle East would devolve into violence after President Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem or recognized the Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is President Trump is the only president to broker a peace agreement between four Muslim-majority countries and Israel,\" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in an email. \"He\u2019s the only modern-day president to have a record of success in the Middle East.\"",
      "Both\u00a0Murphy\u00a0and\u00a0Polymeropoulos\u00a0previously sharply criticized Trump\u2019s decision in his first term to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, warning of possible violence or potential damage to relations with Arab allies.",
      "Trump has defended his remarks on Gaza and renewed his calls for a U.S. takeover, though he said Thursday it would not involve American boots on the ground.",
      "In past decades, suicide terrorist attacks have spiked in response to the U.S. or other foreign militaries\u2019 occupying, or being perceived to be occupying, territory that terrorists see as their homeland, according to research\u00a0by Robert Pape, a professor of international relations at the University of Chicago.",
      "The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation touched off \u201cthe largest suicide terrorist campaign in modern times,\u201d said Pape, who has compiled a database of thousands of suicide attacks worldwide.",
      "As the United States has scaled back its military footprint in the Middle East, the relative terrorist threat against it has receded since the U.S. war in Iraq, he said.",
      "But Trump\u2019s vow to exert U.S. authority over Gaza gives groups like ISIS a major boost and puts Americans in the crosshairs, Pape said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really been quite some time since they\u2019ve had this shot of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cA group like Al Qaeda has been desperate for something like this.\u201d",
      "Jihadist militants will most likely try to organize terrorist attacks against U.S. targets to signal to Washington that they will not tolerate a possible U.S. occupation, he said.",
      "\u201cThey will start attacking Americans to deter us from starting down this road again,\u201d Pape said.",
      "Christopher O\u2019Leary, a former senior FBI official who worked on counterterrorism cases, said Trump\u2019s language could prompt Palestinian militants to focus on targeting Americans abroad and possibly inside the United States, something not seen since the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "And jihadist extremists will seize on his words to stoke anger and paint a picture of the United States as a foreign occupier, he said.",
      "\u201cGlobal jihadist groups will also use a narrative of the United States occupying Arab lands as a rallying cry for new recruits,\u201d said O\u2019Leary, senior vice president at the Soufan Group, a global security consultancy.",
      "O\u2019Leary and other former government officials said Trump\u2019s statements were especially worrying as they coincide with a time of uncertainty and upheaval at U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.",
      "In recent days the Trump administration has launched a review of the conduct of FBI agents who worked on cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol, and it is seeking to drastically reduce the federal workforce by offering so-called buyouts to employees at the FBI, the CIA and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe addition of the Gaza announcement coupled with the erosion of our security services could really elevate the terrorist threat,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to take control of Gaza \u2014\u00a0and potentially expel the roughly 2.2 million Palestinians living there \u2014\u00a0has sparked fury and confusion in the Middle East and around the world. Many foreign government officials, regional analysts and human rights groups say his plan amounts to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought to play down and walk back his comments Wednesday.",
      "But Trump doubled down Thursday, defending his proposal and saying the United States could take over Gaza without needing to send U.S. troops.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that Palestinians could be \u201cresettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.\u201d His contradictory comments added fresh confusion about the future of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Even if Trump renounces his comments or never follows through on his ideas about U.S. control of Gaza, jihadist militants now believe the United States \u2014 which has already invaded one Muslim country in the Middle East \u2014 has its sights set on the Gaza Strip, Pape and other analysts said.",
      "The damage has been done, Pape said. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting ourselves out of this by somehow spinning the facts.\u201d"

By contrast, about 600,000 Venezuelans are in the U.S. under temporary protected status, which Trump is eliminating.",

In 2021, with President Joe Biden in charge, tens of thousands of Haitians arrived at the U.S. border, fleeing their country's political instability and violence. Controversy ensued when U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback tried to drive out some who had already crossed the border. A Department of Homeland Security investigation found some agents used unnecessary force.",
      "Catholic Relief Services, which receives USAID funding, makes the connection between its work and migration in a document on its website that describes reasons people migrate from Central America to the U.S. It cites family-owned businesses being extorted by gangs and drug lords, young people left jobless because their neighborhoods are controlled by criminals, natural disasters and worsened climate conditions.",

      "\u201cAt that moment, migration was lower because people had a lot of expectations and hope that the situation was going to be better,\u201d Bonilla said. \u201cIf you have a country with lower rates of violence, then people don\u2019t want to emigrate.\u201d",

      "\"Not only is this a good idea, we owe it to the American taxpayer because this is taxpayer money. This is not a charity,\" he said.",
      "But Rubio's waiver prohibits migration and refugee assistance programs that provide lifesaving humanitarian aid and support repatriation of people to their country of origin or a third country, such as immigrants deported from the United States. It prohibits any programs it labels \u201cgender or DEI ideology programs, transgender surgeries or other non-life saving assistance.\u201d",
      "While Rubio's waiver may be allowing some of the work to restart, it also has program leaders scrambling to apply for waivers for programs, even as they may be laying off staff because money to pay them has been stopped.",
      "Chambers Sharpe said some groups had completed contracts and the next step was to report the completion of a program to USAID so the contractor could be paid, but with most of the staff at USAID on leave and its headquarters shut, there is no way to get those payments and no one to help them work through a contract or waiver process.",
      "The USAID program official who did not want to be identified said the prohibition on DEI programs also is confusing. Many of the poorest people or those most subjected to violence are from the LGBTQ, Afro Latino or Indigenous communities or are women. The help they give them is not predicated on their identity, but is focused on them because they are the most vulnerable.",

      "\u201cWe are reaching close to our full strength so the mission can start giving results,\u201d Godfrey Otunge, the mission\u2019s force commander, said as he greeted the new officers at Haiti\u2019s main international airport, which remains closed to commercial flights because of ongoing gang violence.",
      "The latest deployment of Kenyan police comes two days after the U.S. notified the United Nations that it was freezing $13.3 million slated for the mission as part of a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Otunge said in a statement Wednesday that the amount frozen represents less than 3% of ongoing assistance to the mission.",
      "\u201cI want to assure everyone, especially the people of Haiti, that the mission remains on track,\u201d he said.",
      "He noted that the U.S. and other partner countries are still providing logistical, financial and equipment support, with support flights arriving almost daily.",
      "\u201cBoth the Department of Defense and the Department of State remain actively engaged in (the mission\u2019s) operations,\u201d Otunge stated.",
      "The U.S. State Department said it approved waivers for $40.7 million in foreign assistance to help the mission and Haitian police, including contracts to support forward operating bases, medical services and vehicle maintenance.",
      "It noted that as recently as Tuesday, the U.S. delivered \u201cmuch-needed heavy armored equipment\u201d to the mission and Haitian police.",
      "\u201cThe Haitian people need security,\u201d said Haitian Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9 as he pointed to a plane on the tarmac. \u201cThis is all the equipment that we promised is coming in.\u201d",
      "Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader warned Thursday during a news conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Haiti represents a threat to the entire region, including the United States.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose,\u201d he said as he called for more financial support for the mission. \u201cHaiti is drowning.\u201d",
      "Abinader also called for more humanitarian aid to the violence-wracked country that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, saying it would help relieve the ongoing crisis and halt a wave of migration that would affect the U.S. and other countries.",
      "\u201cThere is no Dominican solution to the Haitian crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe leadership of the United States is essential and irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "Rubio said the U.S. is committed to supporting the U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police and called for it to be broadened so it could effectively deal with gangs.",
      "He said the issue of Haiti cannot be ignored.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, it\u2019s horrifying, and it needs to be dealt with. \u2026 We are going to help,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThe Haitian National Police are outnumbered and outgunned by the gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cSteady and predictable funding for the (mission) requires all states to contribute, especially those in the region. More stability in Haiti will reduce the pressure to migrate, which is in everyone\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Rubio spoke with Kenyan President William Ruto to thank him for his country\u2019s leadership of the mission in Haiti, which remains fully operational, and Kenya\u2019s role in promoting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The mission, which began last year, is struggling with a lack of funding and personnel as gangs that control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, keep seizing more territory.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 11:48:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 What a difference a few months makes.",
      "The United States and its longtime allies Japan and South Korea have been strengthening ties in recent years, both individually and as a three-way partnership, in an effort to counter an increasingly assertive China and North Korea. But recent political changes in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have injected new uncertainty into their relations.",
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing an impeachment trial over his botched attempt in December to declare martial law, and it will be months before the country has a clear leader. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is hamstrung by a minority government after his scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party performed poorly in an October parliamentary election.",
      "And in the United States, voters elected a president in November who has disdain for alliances and prefers to deal with countries individually, and who in his first term accused Japan and South Korea of \u201cfreeloading\u201d under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "On Friday, Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, in the first major indication of how the new U.S. administration will interact with the two Asian democracies.",
      "Like the U.S., both countries are wary of China\u2019s rise but also count it among their top trading partners. The challenge for Ishiba will be to sell Trump on the importance of U.S. security commitments in Asia and avoid the kinds of tariffs that Trump has imposed on China and threatened to impose on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico.",
      "Ishiba said he planned \u201cto work hard to establish a relationship of mutual trust\u201d during his visit with Trump.",
      "\u201cI hope that we can confirm that by Japan and the U.S. cooperating on issues such as the economy and security, this will bring peace and allow for development not for the free and open Indo-Pacific region but also for the rest of the world,\u201d the Japanese leader told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.",
      "Japanese visit",
      "Ishiba is looking for a \u201cneutral outcome\u201d from the visit, and is most likely just happy to be the second foreign leader to meet with Trump after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Michael Cucek, an assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try to win any points or get any gifts from the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows that there are none available.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is likely to emphasize Japan\u2019s role as the largest foreign investor in the U.S. \u2014 in December, Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, pledged to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years at a meeting with Trump.",
      "Business ties with Japan have been strained by the $15 billion bid by its largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which then-President Joe Biden blocked last month citing national security concerns. Trump also opposes the deal, which Nippon Steel says it has not given up on.",
      "The blocking of the deal is unlikely to fundamentally alter the U.S.-Japan relationship, said Anthony Rapa, partner and co-chair of the International Trade practice group at Blank Rome in Washington, given both countries are more concerned with Indo-Pacific security and countering China.",
      "\u201cThat said, the rejection of the deal genuinely did sting, considering the historical closeness of the two nations, Japan\u2019s standing as the top U.S. investor, and the fact that no Japanese investment had ever been blocked on national security grounds before, at least not publicly,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, said Thursday that the company would be watching the Ishiba-Trump summit closely and that he hoped it would be \u201ca catalyst that would open the way towards the future.\u201d",
      "Cucek said Ishiba would \u201cutterly avoid\u201d raising the topic with Trump, especially since Nippon Steel is suing over the blocking of the deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to bring it up,\u201d Cucek said. \u201cThere\u2019s no advantage that he gets out of it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is unlikely to get along with Trump as well as Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 and who had a close personal relationship with Trump. Cucek said that the current Japanese leader has a fundamentally different temperament from Abe \u2014 who won over Trump with a charm offensive that involved flattery and golf.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, in dealing with Donald Trump, he has this playbook from Abe of simply flattering the man,\u201d he said.",
      "Anxiety in South Korea",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the country could be falling behind in engaging with the Trump administration because of the political instability after Yoon\u2019s short-lived martial law order.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether Yoon, who is suspended from presidential duties after being impeached by lawmakers, should indeed be removed from office. If he is, South Korea would then have 60 days to hold a presidential by-election.",
      "Though Trump had a phone call with Yoon shortly after his election victory in November, he has not spoken with acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok.",
      "\u201cThere is no way that Trump will actually engage directly\u201d with an acting president, said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group in Washington who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cSo waiting six months to have that kind of highest-level meeting will definitely hurt the country,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially given the uncertainty around the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\u201d",
      "There has been other contact, however, including a phone call last month between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, and a call Wednesday between national security adviser Mike Waltz and his South Korean counterpart, Shin Won-sik.",
      "One area where South Korea is eager to coordinate with the U.S. is North Korea, whose leader Kim Jong Un has been advancing his nuclear and ballistic missile programs and ratcheting up his hostile rhetoric against the U.S., South Korea and others.",
      "Trump has said he plans to reach out to Kim, whom he met with three times during his first term.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anxiety, especially on them not being included in the possible U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d said Lee, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Japan, which is also directly threatened by North Korea, shares a number of potential challenges with South Korea in a new Trump administration.",
      "Both countries host thousands of U.S. troops, and both countries came under pressure during Trump\u2019s first term to shoulder more of the cost for that.",
      "Tariffs are another potential concern, after Trump announced 25% tariffs on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico before putting them on hold at the last minute.\u00a0 South Korea, which has a highly export-dependent economy, is considered especially vulnerable, and South Korean companies such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG are exposed because of their facilities in Mexico and China, on which the U.S. imposed a 10% tariff Tuesday.",
      "Though both South Korea and Japan would be affected if Trump imposes a blanket tariff on all U.S. imports as he has floated, both Lee and Cucek said there is no obvious reason for them to be directly targeted the way Canada, Mexico and China were over their alleged roles in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that provides the excuse for the use right now of tariffs,\u201d Cucek said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo and Stella Kim from Seoul, South Korea."

    "summary": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader rejected holding talks with Donald Trump, saying that experience shows it is \u201cnot rational, intelligent, or honorable\u201d to do so.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday rejected the idea of holding talks with the Trump administration, saying that experience had shown it was \u201cnot rational, intelligent, or honorable\u201d to do so.",
      "\u201cNegotiations with America do not solve any of our problems,\u201d Khamenei said in a speech Friday, according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim.",
      "Khamenei\u2019s comments came after Trump on Wednesday indicated a willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran \u201cimmediately.\u201d Days earlier, the president renewed his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran, signing an executive order aimed at preventing it from obtaining nuclear weapons and eliminating its oil exports.",
      "\u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be tough on Iran. We don\u2019t want to be tough on anybody,\" he added, expressing a preference for \u201ca Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper.\u201d",
      "The comments that Khamenei, 85, made in a speech to air force officers also appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks, in which he left the door open to discussions over whether Iran would be prepared to negotiate with the U.S. over enriching weapons-grade uranium and sanctions on billions of dollars worth of exports.",
      "In recent days, both sides have sent \"mixed messages\" as to whether they would engage in nuclear talks, said Darya Dolzikova\u200b, a research fellow with the proliferation and nuclear policy program at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThe intention of [the U.S.] engaging in nuclear diplomacy with Iran is certainly a good one. I guess where the challenges come in is, when the rubber really hits the road, what does that actually look like?\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what that looks like in practice,\u201d Dolzikova added.",
      "Both the White House and the Islamic Republic had this week signaled a change in tone from the first Trump administration, during which he withdrew from a 2015 pact intended to curb Iran's nuclear program signed by the Obama administration, and reinstated crippling sanctions.",
      "Shortly after, the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iran violated the previously agreed-upon enrichment limitations.",
      "But Khamenei pointed to that history Friday, saying that Iran had made \u201cmany concessions\u201d with the U.S. in the 2010s, but that in the end, \u201cAmericans did not honor the deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur government at the time engaged in negotiations, held meetings, had discussions, smiled, shook hands, and built relationships,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe very person who is now in power tore up the agreement.\u201d",
      "While both European and American officials have since attempted to engage with Iran on the issue of nuclear proliferation, those talks have rarely, if ever, ended with a mutually satisfactory outcome.",
      "Trump's executive order Tuesday also triggered a response from Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who told the Iranian news agency Tasmin on Wednesday that \u201cmaximum pressure is a failed experience, and repeating it will lead to another failure.\"",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also played down the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Wednesday, he urged\u00a0fellow members of the\u00a0Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to unite against possible U.S. sanctions on the major oil producer, later saying that \u201cIran is a powerful and resource-rich country that can navigate challenges by managing its resources.\u201d",
      "Iranian officials in recent days have repeatedly claimed the country isn't actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, reiterating that it is a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.",
      "While Iran has not yet pursued building a nuclear bomb, a 2023 report released by watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0found the country had begun enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Trump indicated that the executive order he signed this week was intended to deter Iran from further developing its nuclear capabilities.",
      "\u201cWe will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions to drive Iranian oil exports to zero and diminish the regime\u2019s capacity to fund terror throughout the region and through the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, despite American efforts to target Iran's economy, RUSI's Dolzikova said that the use of sanctions is \u201cprobably not as strong of a lever as it will have been four or five years ago,\u201d because the Iranian economy has since adapted to the pressure by expanding its relations with Russia and China.",
      "She added that \u201cif the Trump administration does go after those continued exports to China, as they seem set to do, then that might create additional pressure.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world, in all Situations before it,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights.\u201d",

      "\u201cIndians deserve Dignity and Humanity, NOT Handcuffs,\u201d Gandhi wrote on the social media platform X.",
      "Gandhi uploaded a video showing another deportee, Harvinder Singh, as saying they were handcuffed and their feet chained for 40 hours. \u201cWe were not allowed to move an inch from our seats. It was worse than hell,\u201d he said.",
      "Later Thursday, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Parliament\u2019s upper house that U.S. regulations have allowed for the use of restraints since 2012, on both military and civilian flights. He said the U.S. authorities have informed them that women and children are not restrained.",
      "\u201cThere has been no change, I repeat, no change, from past procedure for the flight undertaken by the U.S.\u201d on Wednesday, he said.",
      "Jaishankar said the government was engaging the U.S. authorities to \u201censure that the returning deportees are not mistreated.\u201d",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to visit Washington next week. Trump and Modi discussed immigration in a phone call last week and Trump stressed the importance of fair bilateral trade and India buying more American-made security equipment.",

      "\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens,\u201d Christopher Elms said.",
      "Indians were arrested more than 14,000 times for illegally entering the U.S. on the Canadian border during a 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. That amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago. Indians were arrested more than 25,000 times on the Mexican border during that time.",
      "Jaishankar, India\u2019s external affairs minister, told Parliament that 15,668 Indian nationals had been deported back to India from the U.S. since 2009."

      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThe national security threat that DeepSeek \u2014 a CCP-affiliated company \u2014 poses to the United States is alarming.\u201d",
      "He said DeepSeek\u2019s generative AI program can acquire the data of U.S. users and store the information for unidentified use by Chinese authorities.",
      "The chatbot app, however, has intentionally hidden code that could send user login information to China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company that has been banned from operating in the U.S., according to an analysis by Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot Security, which specializes in data protection and cybersecurity. His analysis was published earlier by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cUnder no circumstances can we allow a CCP company to obtain sensitive government or personal data,\u201d Gottheimer said.",

      "A representative for DeepSeek could not be reached for comment. The bill was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which said DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other governments have already issued warnings about or placed restrictions on the use of DeepSeek, including South Korea and Italy. Australia and Taiwan both banned DeepSeek from all government devices this week over security concerns.",
      "Founded in 2023, DeepSeek entered the mainstream U.S. consciousness late last month amid reports it was able to produce better AI results at a fraction of the cost of what American tech firms have so far been able to achieve. Those fears caused U.S. tech stocks to briefly tumble last week.",
      "There remains debate about the veracity of those reports, with some technologists saying there has not been a full accounting of DeepSeek's development costs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mindboggling that we are unknowingly allowing China to survey Americans and we\u2019re doing nothing about it,\u201d  Tsarynny told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that something like this was accidental. There are so many unusual things to this. You know that saying \u2018Where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire\u2019? In this instance, there\u2019s a lot of smoke,\u201d he said."
