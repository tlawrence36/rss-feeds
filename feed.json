      "Georgia police say Tyrese Gibson failed to turn himself in late last week after an arrest warrant was issued for cruelty to animals",
      "Tyrese Gibson failed to turn himself in to police after an arrest warrant was issued because his four Cane Corso dogs mauled and killed a neighbor\u2019s dog in Georgia in mid-September, police said Tuesday.",
      "The warrant for cruelty to animals issued for the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d actor is part of an \u201congoing issue\u201d following multiple calls about the dogs in the past few months, Fulton County Police Captain Nicole Dwyer said.",
      "\u201cOur priority is the safety of the community and when there\u2019s so many incidents of dogs, especially large dogs like this, getting out and then killing an animal, you know, what\u2019s next? A child?\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cOur main priority is safety and that\u2019s why we want the dogs in custody.\u201d",
      "Gibson had received multiple warnings before the warrant was issued, and police had attempted to cite him before the attack, but the actor wasn\u2019t at his Atlanta home. Dwyer said she spoke with Gibson\u2019s lawyer last week and informed them the actor had to turn himself in by Friday.",
      "Gibson\u2019s attorney, Gabe Banks, wrote to in an email to The Associated Press the actor is \u201ccooperating fully with authorities to address and resolve this matter responsibly.\u201d Gibson wasn\u2019t home when the incident took place, Banks wrote, and \u201cimmediately made the difficult decision to rehome his dogs to a safe and loving environment.\u201d",
      "Just after 10 p.m. on Sept. 18, a neighbor of Gibson\u2019s, whose house is half a mile away, let their dog, a small spaniel, out to their yard and returned five minutes later to find the dog had been attacked. The dog was rushed to a veterinary hospital, but did not survive, Dwyer said.",

      "Banks wrote that Gibson \u201cextends his deepest condolences to the family who lost their beloved dog to this tragic incident.\u201d",
      "Gibson posted a video to Instagram that included various clips of his dogs early Monday. He didn\u2019t speak in the video, but rather included audio from the podcast, \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d where hosts discussed the case.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\u201cHis crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\u201d they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "They called Combs \u201cunrepentant\u201d and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \u201cincredibly, ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\u201d",

      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars that he should be freed soon.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

      "Access to officials in the Pentagon has been invaluable in helping reporters understand what is going on, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at The Washington Post who is now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland. With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",
      "\u2022 In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.",
      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Since Trump took office, Bad Bunny's criticism hasn\u2019t slowed. This year, he shared an Instagram video appearing to show immigration agents making arrests in Puerto Rico, with the voice behind the camera cursing the agents.",

      "Trump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",
      "The moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country\u2019s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",
      "He also revived his long-running feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell, saying earlier this year that he was considering \u201ctaking away\u201d her U.S. citizenship after she criticized his proposed spending cuts.",
      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "NEW DELHI -- The death toll following a stampede at a political rally for a popular Indian actor and politician in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has climbed to 40, the state\u2019s health minister said Sunday, as medics treated at least 124 injured in hospitals.",

      "A new poll finds that younger adults are more likely to use subtitles while watching TV or movies than are older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",

      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

He also notes that speakers are often on the back of a flat-screen TV and project toward the wall. \u201cSo you\u2019re not listening on a stellar sound system to start with,\u201d he says.",
      "Another factor is performance-based.",
      "Actors have \u201ca more internal and close\u201d style of emoting than they did decades ago, says sound designer Karol Urban, and sometimes that makes it difficult to discern dialogue.",
      "And there is now simply a lot more sound competing with dialogue, Urban says. \u201cBack in the day there were a lot less sound effects, less music swells,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhen you add more things under dialogue, you\u2019re adding more frequencies and things that can interfere with dialogue.\u201d",
      "Davis, of Tampa, Florida, points to the show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as one instance where she often turns on subtitles so she is not constantly adjusting the volume.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the speaking in that show is low and fits the dark environment if it\u2019s in a certain scene,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the next scene will be just music and it's blasting through the walls.\u201d",
      "About one-quarter of subtitle users say they turn on captions because they are watching while multitasking. Fewer say the reason is a hearing impairment, trying to learn a new language or watching with the sound off.",
      "Ask a younger or older adult, though, and you could get a very different justification.",
      "Young adults who have used subtitles are more likely than those 45 and older to say they do this because they are watching in a noisy environment or watching while multitasking. Older subtitle users \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are more likely than younger adults to say they use closed captions because they have difficulty understanding accents or because of a hearing impairment.",
      "About 3 in 10 adults 60 and older who use subtitles say they use closed captions because of a hearing impairment, compared with only 7% for younger adults.",
      "Patricia Gill, 67, of Columbus, Tennessee, does not use closed captions. But when her grandson comes over, Gill often notices he has subtitles on his phone when watching movies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a typical almost-teenager, he just likes watching his phone,\u201d she says.",

      "Colin Dickerman, editor-in-chief at Grand Central Publishing and editor of Case's book, has a hunch that it will.

From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",

      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",

      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy. A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.",
      "In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.",
      "Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead \u201cthe worst polluters\u201d to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.",
      "\u201cNobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,\u201d said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.",
      "\u201cThis administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,\u201d Symons said. \u201cWhittling away at EPA\u2019s ability to do its job.\u201d",
      "A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they \u201csignificantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.\u201d Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.",
      "The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an \u201cenvironmental ethic\u201d in his first speech.",
      "\u201cEach of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,\" Ruckelshaus said. \"Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.\u201d",
      "In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.",
      "EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what\u2019s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth\u2019s police officer if it isn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cProtecting human health and the environment is critical to the country\u2019s overall well-being,\" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W.

Known as the \u201cendangerment\u201d finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.",
      "The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.",
      "EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut \u2014 former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% \u2014 but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.",

It won\u2019t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

      "The cabinet denied KPR\u2019s request for case notes on individual fraud accusations starting in early 2024 that would include the evidence used in the accusations. But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",
      "She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,\u201d she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.",
      "She received another hearing, but the outcome didn\u2019t change.",
      "Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren\u2019t forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.",
      "But all of these things are used as evidence \u2014 sometimes the sole evidence \u2014 that a person misused their benefits.",
      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ... But cases with non-transactional data are exceedingly rare.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",

      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development.

      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",

      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",

      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

      "\u201cUnlike the previous administration which chose to sue, obstruct, and delay, President Trump and his team have worked alongside us to improve Georgia Pathways and ultimately deliver a better program to Georgians who need it most,\" Kemp said in a statement.",
      "A federal watchdog reported earlier this month that Georgia spent $54.2 million in administrative spending and $26.2 million on health care from 2021 through the middle of 2025. The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",
      "Nearly 90% of spending has been federal money, and Georgia used $20 million in other federal grants to help implement the program.",
      "Opponents, including Democratic U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, deride Pathways as festooned in red tape while funneling money to the private consulting firm that runs it. In a Thursday statement, Warnock said that \u201cthe only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer.\"",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision will continue to keep health care away from Georgians who need it most. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it only makes our country sicker and poorer,\u201d Warnock continued.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- As a deadly new Ebola outbreak kills dozens in southern Congo, health authorities and organizations are sounding the alarm, warning they lack the funds and resources to mount an effective response to the crisis.",
      "The World Health Organization said Wednesday that 57 cases and 35 deaths have been reported since the outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 4. The fatality rate is over 61%.",
      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,\u201d said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.",
      "Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.",
      "According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.",
      "Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of U.S. funding cuts, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",
      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",
      "Despite the absence of USAID, Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, said that the U.S. government has provided \u201csome small support,\u201d though he could not provide specific details.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that the organization\u2019s only current funding for the outbreak response is a $2 million emergency fund and around $2.3 million from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Gavi vaccine alliance.",
      "That is far below the WHO\u2019s projected cost of around $20 million to respond to the outbreak over the next three months.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities,\u201d Jasarevic said.",

      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",
      "It is also considering taking legal action, the group said.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills. Prescribers in states where they\u2019re allowed have been shipping the pills to places where abortion is banned, a practice that is facing some legal challenges and is expected to attract more.",

The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops given the powerful Democratic senator\u2019s support for abortion rights.",

Responding to a question in English from the U.S. broadcaster EWTN News, he said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",

Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\u201d he said.",

      "A tariff war instigated by Trump's administration and his transactional approach to security threaten to erode many South Koreans' trust in the U.S. There are concerns that he may demand much higher South Korean payments for the U.S. military presence in the country or possibly downsize America\u2019s military footprint to focus more on China.",
      "In an Armed Forces Day ceremony Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung described the South Korea-U.S. military alliance as \u201csolid\u201d and didn't mention any concerns about Trump's policies. But he repeatedly stressed an intention to build a strong military that can independently defend the country from external threats.",
      "\u201cWe should move toward a strong, self-reliant defense, based on our pride and confidence in our military power,\u201d Lee said. \u201cTo ensure peace and prosperity for the Republic of Korea, we must not depend on anyone else but strengthen our own power.\u201d",
      "To boost a self-reliant defense posture, Lee said his government would increase next year's defense spending by 8.2% to introduce advanced weapons systems like AI combat robots, autonomous drones and precision-guided missiles.",
      "The government will also actively foster the defense industry and improve soldiers\u2019 welfare by upgrading their service conditions and compensation systems, he said.",
      "Lee, a liberal who espouses greater peace on the Korean Peninsula, made no direct mention of North Korean military threats and may have been attempting to avoid provoking the country, though he said South Korea's spending on defense is 1.4 times more than North Korea's gross domestic product. Bolstering South Korea's military readiness would clearly be aimed at increasing deterrence against potential aggressions from North Korea, which has nuclear weapons.",
      "The North recently has repeatedly rejected Lee's overtures, though it signaled interests in restoring diplomacy with Trump.",
      "A weakening of the U.S. security commitment could seriously shake South Korea's security as it has no nuclear weapons and is under the so-called U.S. \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d protection, which guarantees a devastating American response in the event of an attack on its ally. The U.S. has about 28,500 troops in South Korea.",
      "A potentially sensitive issue for the alliance is an implementation of a previous agreement to transfer wartime operational control of the allied forces to a binational command led by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy. The commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea currently has wartime operational control of South Korea's military.",
      "Many South Koreans view reclaiming their own military's wartime operational control as a matter of national sovereignty but others worry that would result in loosening of the alliance. Some observers say the Trump administration would use the transfer as a way to reduce spending and concentrate on China but it would still want to maintain influence on the Korean Peninsula.",

      "Arnold Schwarzenegger is throwing his weight behind the Vatican\u2019s environmental initiative",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Arnold Schwarzenegger downplayed the Trump administration\u2019s climate skepticism Tuesday and threw his weight behind the Vatican\u2019s environmental initiative, saying individual choice, local regulations and the Catholic Church's moral leadership were far more important to \u201cterminate\u201d global warming.",
      "Schwarzenegger was at the Vatican to headline a three-day climate conference marking the 10th anniversary of Pope Francis\u2019 landmark 2015 environmental encyclical, Laudato Si (Praised Be). The document, one of Francis' main legacies, cast saving God\u2019s creation as an urgent moral imperative and launched a broad, grassroots movement that Pope Leo XIV has fully embraced and made his own.",
      "Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, has devoted time to environmental causes since leaving political office in 2011. His Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative is one of the backers of the Vatican conference, which is being held at the Holy See\u2019s newly inaugurated environmental educational center in Castel Gandolfo south of Rome.",

His administration has rolled back landmark regulations, withdrawn climate project funding and instead bolstered support for oil and gas production in the name of an \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d agenda.",

    "summary": "Nearly identical under the metal, the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride have been leaders in the three-row SUV class since their introductions in 2020",
    "story": [
      "Nearly identical under the metal, the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride have been leaders in the three-row SUV class since their introductions in 2020",
      "Suppose you\u2019ve considered the Hyundai Palisade or Kia Telluride for your next three-row SUV. In that case, you probably know both models are nearly identical under the metal. Or rather, they were until recently. Redesigned for 2026 with new style, new engines and upgraded technology features, the second-generation Palisade refines an already impressive model that consistently finishes near the top of Edmunds\u2019 annual SUV rankings.",
      "For now, Kia is standing pat with its Telluride. A redesign is coming, but so far Kia has not released any official details or a timetable. If you\u2019re thinking of buying a new three-row SUV, should you get the new Palisade, the current Telluride, or maybe even wait? Edmunds\u2019 auto experts compared these two family-friendly SUVs to find out.",
      "Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The 2026 Palisade starts at $41,035, including the destination fee, while the 2025 Telluride starts at $37,885. Both SUVs come with standard eight-passenger seating, LED headlights, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot warning. The Telluride also offers standard synthetic leather upholstery, which gives it a more premium feel than Palisade\u2019s standard cloth seating.",
      "The Telluride\u2019s lower starting price is compelling, though the Palisade does offer a few extras to justify its higher price. These include wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (so you don\u2019t have to use a USB cord), front and rear parking sensors, and automatic braking while in reverse.",
      "It\u2019s a similar story at the top end of the range. A loaded-up Telluride SX-Prestige costs $52,885, while a Palisade Calligraphy costs $56,160. You\u2019ll pay more for that Palisade but get a few extras in return that aren\u2019t on the Telluride, such as a massaging driver\u2019s seat and front and rear dashcams that you can use to record video and review it at a later time.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "Two new engines are among the 2026 Palisade\u2019s changes. A 287-horsepower V6 is standard, and it gets up to a Hyundai-estimated 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving. A turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid with 258 horsepower also joins the lineup. No fuel economy estimates were available at the time of our article\u2019s publication, but we\u2019d guess the Palisade Hybrid will get in the low to mid-30s for mpg.",
      "The new base V6 is a step backward, however. It makes roughly the same power as the larger V6 it replaces, but it also contends with a heavier Palisade. The Hyundai\u2019s extra 400 pounds showed up in Edmunds\u2019 testing, where it took 8.8 seconds to reach 60 mph. That\u2019s more than 1 second slower than before and makes the Palisade one of today\u2019s slowest three-row SUVs.",
      "The Telluride has a 291-horsepower V6 that gets up to 22 mpg combined. That helps it reach 60 mph in 7.5 seconds in Edmunds\u2019 testing, which is about average compared to its rivals. We expect the next-gen Telluride to adopt the new powertrains in the Palisade. Still, for now, it comes down to whether you want the superior acceleration of the Telluride\u2019s V6 or the more frugal mpg potential of the Palisade Hybrid.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "The Palisade is supremely quiet and comfortable, easily gliding over rough road surfaces without disturbing the cabin. There\u2019s ample visibility for the driver, and both rear rows offer vast expanses of headroom and legroom. The Telluride is equally cushy and forgiving of bad roads, but the new Palisade\u2019s seats and composure are just a bitbetter. This assessment is less an indictment of the Telluride than a testament to the Palisade\u2019s upgrades.",

The Palisade can hold 19.1 cubic feet of cargo behind its third row or 46.3 cubes if you fold down the third row. Fold down both the second and third rows and you\u2019ll have 86.7 cubic feet to work with. The Telluride has slightly more space on the spec sheet but not enough to make a meaningful difference in real-world use.",

      "Japan\u2019s chief trade negotiator has defended a tariffs deal with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s chief trade negotiator has defended a tariffs deal with the U.S., expressing respect for President Donald Trump and calling him a \u201ctough negotiator.\u201d",
      "Trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa noted that the pact setting on most Japanese exports to the U.S. at 15% was comparable to a deal between Washington and the European Union. Unlike the EU, Japan did not have to lower its tariffs on U.S. goods, he noted.",
      "Japan has also committed to investing $550 billion in U.S. projects.",
      "Trump initially set Japan\u2019s tariff rate to increase by 25%.",
      "Critics in Japan had ridiculed Akazawa's repeated trips to the U.S. to work toward a deal as a waste of taxpayer money, saying he should pitch a tent on the White House lawn.",
      "Akazawa said talks with his counterpart, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump and others in his administration were tense at first. By the time of his eighth trip, a rapport was established enabling the two sides to set an agreement by July.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was a tough negotiator, but I kept insisting, and he would listen graciously. I have all the respect for him,\u201d he told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan. \u201cIt was a good round of negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt goes without saying that, with any government negotiations, there will always be someone who says Japan lost out, no matter what,\u201d Akazawa said.",
      "The double-digit tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from various nations were a bitter blow to Japan, a key U.S. ally in Asia. Tokyo especially objected to 25% tariffs Trump ordered for imports of steel and aluminum and automobiles.",

      "The government shutdown has begun",
      "WASHINGTON -- Plunged into a government shutdown, the U.S. is confronting a fresh cycle of uncertainty after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to strike an agreement to keep government programs and services running by Wednesday\u2019s deadline.",
      "Roughly 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, some potentially fired by Trump's Republican administration. Many offices will be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as Trump vows to \u201cdo things that are irreversible, that are bad\u201d as retribution. His deportation agenda is expected to run full speed ahead, while education, environmental and other services sputter. The economic fallout is expected to ripple nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to shut down,\u201d Trump said at the White House before the midnight deadline.",
      "But the president, who met privately with congressional leadership this week, appeared unable to negotiate any deal between Democrats and Republicans to prevent that outcome.",
      "This is the third time Trump has presided over a federal funding lapse, the first since his return to the White House this year, in a remarkable record that underscores the polarizing divide over budget priorities and a political climate that rewards hard-line positions rather than more traditional compromises.",
      "The Democrats picked this fight, which was unusual for the party that prefers to keep government running, but their voters are eager to challenge the president\u2019s second-term agenda. Democrats are demanding funding for health care subsidies that are expiring for millions of people under the Affordable Care Act, spiking the costs of insurance premiums nationwide.",
      "Republicans have refused to negotiate for now and have encouraged Trump to steer clear of any talks. After the White House meeting, the president posted a cartoonish fake video mocking the Democratic leadership that was widely viewed as unserious and racist.",
      "What neither side has devised is an easy offramp to prevent what could become a protracted closure. The ramifications are certain to spread beyond the political arena, upending the lives of Americans who rely on the government for benefit payments, work contracts and the various services being thrown into turmoil.",
      "\u201cWhat the government spends money on is a demonstration of our country\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Rachel Snyderman, a former White House budget official who is the managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.",
      "Shutdowns, she said, \u201conly inflict economic cost, fear and confusion across the country.\u201d",
      "An economic jolt could be felt in a matter of days. The government is expected Friday to produce its monthly jobs report, which may or may not be delivered.",
      "While the financial markets have generally \u201cshrugged\u201d during past shutdowns, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis, this one could be different partly because there are no signs of broader negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere are also few good analogies to this week\u2019s potential shutdown,\u201d the analysis said.",
      "Across the government, preparations have been underway. Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russ Vought, directed agencies to execute plans for not just furloughs, as are typical during a federal funding lapse, but mass firings of federal workers. It\u2019s part of the Trump administration\u2019s mission, including its Department of Government Efficiency, to shrink the federal government.",
      "The Medicare and Medicaid health care programs are expected to continue, though staffing shortages could mean delays for some services. The Pentagon would still function. And most employees will stay on the job at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "But Trump has warned that the administration could focus on programs that are important to Democrats, \u201ccutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\u201d",

      "Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s start of the fiscal year, House Republicans had approved a temporary funding bill, over opposition from Democrats, to keep government running into mid-November while broader negotiations continue.",

Meanwhile, the Middle East also remains on edge after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. The Houthis separately threatened to \u201cemploy all means and instruments available\u201d to target several American oil firms.",
      "The Houthis fired a cruise missile that targeted and struck the Minervagracht, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said.",
      "Saree accused the the ship's owners, Amsterdam-based Spliethoff, of violating \u201cthe entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine.\u201d Initially, the U.S. Navy-overseen Joint Maritime Information Center said the Minervagracht had no ties to Israel, but a note Tuesday said the center was \u201creviewing vessel affiliations for possible links to Israel.\u201d",
      "The attack wounded two mariners on board the Minervagracht, whose 19-member crew hailed from the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine. They were forced to evacuate the ship after the strike inflicted substantial damage.",
      "Spliethoff said Wednesday it was working with \u201cinternational authorities and salvage experts to safeguard and secure the vessel.\u201d A European naval force operating in the region, known as Operation Aspides, said Tuesday the Minervagracht was on fire and adrift after the crew\u2019s rescue.",
      "\u201cWe would again like to express our deepest concern over this week\u2019s incident which was a direct attack on our innocent seafarers and a breach of the right of free navigation,\u201d Spliethoff said in a statement.",

      "Meanwhile, the Houthis said Wednesday they had levied sanctions against multiple American oil companies, including Chevron Corp, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp., as well as individuals and two ships. The rebels in the past have issued such designations before launching attacks.",

The controller acknowledged that mistake in an interview after the incident.",
      "Another factor that contributed to the planes coming so close is that the controller's supervisor in the tower was also distracted.

The supervisor decided to try to fix the printer instead of just switching over to the backup printer, taking their attention away from the landing operation, the report said.",
      "Fortunately the San Diego airport is one of 35 major airports where the FAA has installed advanced surface radar systems installed to help track aircraft and vehicles on the ground. That system provided a crucial backup layer of safety that prevented a crash in this incident.",

    "summary": "Annuities come in many forms",
    "story": [
      "Annuities come in many forms",
      "Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond.",
      "They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what\u2019s called \u201clongevity risk pooling,\u201d which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you\u2019re the one who lives to be 99, you\u2019re the winner in that situation. That\u2019s one reason that payouts are higher than you\u2019d see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can\u2019t get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end.",
      "A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household\u2019s basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses\u2014housing, taxes, healthcare\u2014total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That\u2019s an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it.",
      "A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you\u2019re in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular \u201cfixed index\u201d annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum.",
      "A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into.",
      "At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn\u2019t there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you\u2019re getting with this product that you couldn\u2019t get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don\u2019t sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they\u2019re able to make good on whatever promises they\u2019re making.",

      "A: It depends on the account that you use to fund the annuity, but generally, you will owe taxes. You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you\u2019ll owe taxes on any money that hasn\u2019t been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate.",

      "Chicago Blackhawks' general manager Kyle Davidson focuses on developing the team's top prospects, including 11 first-round picks since 2022",
      "CHICAGO -- When it comes to his plans for the Chicago Blackhawks, general manager Kyle Davidson is focused on the growth and maturation of the organization's top prospects. That group includes a total of 11 first-round picks since the 2022 draft.",
      "Such is life these days for the NHL's rebuilding teams, looking to chart a course back to the playoffs in a league with a rising salary cap. Financial flexibility \u2014 when it comes to free agency, or using cap space to facilitate a trade \u2014 isn't what it used to be, putting an even bigger emphasis on player development.",
      "\u201c(Free agency) is something that\u2019s definitely a tool in our toolbox in roster building,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut I think the main one has to be and will be growing from within and building from within.\u201d",
      "The salary cap for this season is $95.5 million, up from $88 million. It goes up to $104 million for the 2026-27 season and $113.5 million in \u201927-28. Making the most of the NHL's healthy financial outlook, many of the league's top teams retained their best players this summer.",
      "Mitch Marner went from Toronto to Las Vegas in a sign-and-trade deal before free agency started, and Nikolaj Ehlers waited until July 3 before agreeing to a $51 million, six-year contract with Carolina. But depth pieces made up most of the free agent market.",
      "Kirill Kaprizov agreed to a $136 million, eight-year contract with Minnesota that was announced on Tuesday. The 28-year-old Kaprizov could have hit free agency after this season, but the talented forward stayed with the Wild for a record-setting deal.",
      "\u201cYou saw it this summer,\u201d Columbus general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cSummers before you\u2019d always have seven, eight, nine teams that had to move money to get under the cap. You didn\u2019t see that this summer. ... I think going forward you\u2019re going to see less free agency. You\u2019re going to see teams locking up their own players if they can.\u201d",
      "A diminished level of free agency puts the NHL's non-playoff teams in the same boat, facing even more pressure to grow their own stars.",
      "\u201cUltimately, for teams in our situation, I think you need those young players coming in to build that core,\" Detroit general manager Steve Yzerman said.",
      "Developing those young players goes beyond the organization, stretching to its draft picks on college, junior and international club teams. Anton Frondell, an 18-year-old forward who was selected by Chicago with the No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, is staying in Sweden this season, and Vaclav Nestrasil, another first-rounder for the Blackhawks, is playing for the University of Massachusetts.",
      "When it comes to their prospects in other programs, NHL teams stay in close contact with their players and the coaching staffs on their teams. It doesn't sound as if Davidson and the Blackhawks have any plans to alter their approach even with their development focus.",

      "Technology has become a major part of player development across the NHL. The Blackhawks use an internal app to share video, tips and other information with their current players and the prospects in their system. Davidson described the Blackhawks as \u201cactively investigating\u201d how it can use artificial intelligence within the organization.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Drugmaker Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs under a deal struck with the Trump administration, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, as he promised similar deals will be struck with other drugmakers facing a threat of tariffs.",
      "The announcement, which Trump made with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, came as the Republican president has for months sought to lower drug costs. It also came as Washington faced a federal government shutdown at midnight amid a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over health care and its costs.",
      "Under the agreement, New York-based Pfizer will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid and guarantee that pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how big this is,\" the president said.",
      "\u201cI think,\" Bourla said, \u201ctoday we are turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation.\u201d",
      "Trump has been talking for months about the need to lower drug prices. In May, he issued an executive order that gave drugmakers 30 days to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.",
      "To persuade them to strike deals, Trump said he threatened to impose tariffs \u2014 a favorite tool of his to use as leverage across all areas of government \u2014 but that move could raise drug prices.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the new policy will affect patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes. They often pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay.",
      "\u201cThis is something that most people said was not doable,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.",
      "One thing that is not doable, however, was Trump\u2019s repeated claim that it would cut drug prices by more than 100%, \u201c14, 15, 1,600% reductions in some cases,\u201d he said.",
      "A 100% reduction would make the drugs free. Cuts greater than that would essentially mean people are paid to take the drugs.",

      "Attorney Ben Crump has announced that multiple people have contacted the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, a 32-year-old man who died from blunt force injuries on the Stardust Racers roller coaster at Universal's Epic Universe on September 17, to share...",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Multiple people have reached out with related stories to the family of a 32-year-old man who died of blunt force injuries two weeks ago while riding the new Stardust Racers roller coaster at Universal's Epic Universe theme park, the attorney for the man's family said Tuesday.",
      "People who've contacted the family and Ben Crump's law office since Kevin Rodriguez Zavala died Sept. 17 while riding the roller coaster include a woman who says she lost consciousness and suffered neck and spine injuries soon after the ride opened in May, Crump said during a news conference in Orlando.",
      "The woman reached out to Zavala's family on a GoFundMe page and told them about the experience she had on the roller coaster.",
      "\u201cAll we want is answers regarding my son\u2019s death,\" Zavala's mother, Ana Zavala, said through an interpreter at Tuesday's news conference. \u201cWe want these answers so we can be able to honor him. We want these answers so we can have some peace. It is extremely difficult losing a son and we do not wish this pain on anyone.\u201d",
      "The dual-launch coaster reaches speeds up to 62 mph (100 kph) and debuted officially in May when Universal Orlando Resort's newest theme park opened to the public.",
      "A spokeswoman for Universal didn't immediately respond to an inquiry on Tuesday.",
      "Separately, a central Florida woman sued Universal last week saying she had suffered injuries while on the roller coaster. Sandi Streets said her head shook violently and slammed into her seat\u2019s headrest when she was on the ride in April, before the park's official opening, giving her permanent injuries, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Crump questioned what Universal did after receiving reports from the woman and others who said they were injured on the ride.",
      "\u201cShe told them that you all need to do something about this because someone is going to be seriously injured, or worse, they're going to be killed,\u201d Crump said. \u201cShe gave them notice, and she believed that the employees already know that there were problems with this roller coaster. And it begs the question, what did Universal do about it?\u201d",
      "In Zavala\u2019s case, the medical examiner for the Orlando area ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and said the manner of death was an accident.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort\u2019s president, told workers in a note shortly after Zavala's death that internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures. Investigators with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services also said that their initial findings align with that of the theme park.",

      "Crump said his team will be calling for greater government oversight for large corporations such as Universal and Disney. Florida\u2019s largest theme parks are exempt from state safety inspections, unlike smaller venues and fairs. Instead, the largest theme parks like Walt Disney World and Universal conduct their own inspections and have their own protocols, but they must report to the state any injury or death.",
      "Since Epic Universe opened in May, there have been three reports made about rides at the theme park. In May, a 63-year-old man with a preexisting condition experienced dizziness and \u201can altered state of consciousness\u201d and a 47-year-old woman with a preexisting condition had a \u201cvisual disturbance\u201d and numbness after going on the Stardust Racers coaster, on separate days. A 32-year-old man experienced chest pains after going on the Hiccup\u2019s Wing Gliders ride, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services.",
      "\u201cWe believe there were warning signs that there was something wrong with the design of this ride and that they tried to blame the victims,\u201d Crump said.",
      "Zavala\u2019s family has said he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair, but that didn't cause his death.",
      "\u201cIf they believed that disabled people should not be on this roller coaster, then why would you assist him in getting on the roller coaster?\u201d Crump said. \u201cNow you can't justify this by trying to blame the victim.\u201d",
      "Crump is asking anyone who has been injured on the roller coaster to contact his office, as well anyone who witnessed what happened that day.",

      "While unemployment and layoffs remain historically low, there has been noticeable deterioration in the labor market this year and mounting evidence that people are having difficulty finding jobs.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that U.S. nonfarm employers added a paltry 22,000 jobs in August, following July\u2019s disappointing 79,000 job gains. Worse, revisions to the May and June figures shaved 258,000 jobs off previous estimates. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.",

      "Tickets for next year's FIFA World Cup officially go on sale Wednesday",
      "MIAMI -- Not even half of the spots in the 48-team field have been claimed. The schedule of matches won\u2019t be finalized until December. And other than host nations U.S., Canada and Mexico, nobody has any idea where or when they\u2019ll be playing.",
      "Millions of soccer fans worldwide evidently don\u2019t seem to mind any of those points.",
      "Tickets to next year\u2019s FIFA World Cup officially go on sale Wednesday. The buyers will be those who were selected, out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month, to have the first formal chance to purchase tickets over the next few days. FIFA said lottery winners have been, or will soon be, informed by email.",
      "There are unique questions for consumers heading into the tournament, particularly about how they'll get visas, if necessary, to visit the U.S. as the country cracks down on immigration. There are also more traditional concerns such as who, when and where \u2014 and none of those will be answered until the draw on Dec. 5. FIFA knows many fans won\u2019t fret about those answers; they\u2019ll just want tickets now and will figure out the rest later.",
      "\u201cThese are not only outstanding figures, but also a strong statement,\u201d FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on social media, reacting to the 4.5 million applicants for a spot in the purchase window that opened Wednesday. \u201cThe whole world wants to be part of the FIFA World Cup 26, the biggest, most inclusive and most exciting event ever. From Canada, Mexico and the United States, to countries big and small across every continent, fans are proving once again passion for football truly unites.\u201d",
      "In divided times, the notion of soccer being something that \u201ctruly unites\u201d will be put to the test.",
      "Here are some things to know as tickets go on sale.",
      "Fans can purchase seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket prices will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final but could \u2014 and almost certainly will \u2014 change as soccer\u2019s biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time.",
      "There are other ways to get tickets other than shelling out big bucks. American Airlines announced last month that its AAdvantage loyalty program members can redeem miles for World Cup tickets, starting Oct. 13 for executive platinum and concierge key members, then Oct. 14 for platinum pro, platinum and gold members, followed on Oct. 15 by all members.",
      "And starting Thursday, some Verizon customers will have access to free World Cup tickets and other perks. The telecommunications giant is a World Cup sponsor and will simply start dropping free ticket chances to its customers through its app.",
      "\u201cFor me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that\u2019s on or o\ufb00 the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament,\u201d said soccer icon David Beckham, part of Verizon\u2019s promotion for the World Cup.",
      "The U.S., Mexico and Canada all automatically qualified as host nations. Also in so far: defending champion Argentina, Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, South Korea, Brazil, Australia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Tunisia, Colombia, Paraguay and Morocco.",
      "That leaves 30 spots still unclaimed.",
      "FIFA said fans from 216 countries and territories applied to be part of the first ticket lottery. The top three nations of interest, to no surprise, were the hosts: the U.S., Mexico and Canada, in that order. The rest of the top 10, also in order of application totals: Germany, England, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain and Italy.",

      "A'ja Wilson and the Las Vegas Aces are looking to accomplish something only done once before by winning a third WNBA championship in four seasons. Standing in the way are the Phoenix Mercury, who are making their first championship appearance since 2021.",
      "The WNBA Finals will begin Friday in Las Vegas between the second-seed Aces and No. 4 seed Mercury. This year for the first time the two teams will play in a best-of-seven format as the league expanded its championship round from a five-game series.",
      "The Aces were pushed to the brink in both the opening round of the playoffs and in the semifinals where they beat Indiana in overtime in a decisive Game 5 on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cPeople counted us out, but we\u2019re making it to the finals,\" Wilson said. \"We're not done yet.\"",
      "In the beginning of August, the Aces looked down and out as they sat at .500 and were coming off a record home loss to Minnesota. The team responded winning its final 16 regular season games to improbably clinch the No. 2 seed.",
      "They are back in the championship round after losing to New York in the semifinals last season. Las Vegas won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023. Only Houston has won three titles in a four year stretch when the Comets won the first four championships in league history.",
      "Phoenix is trying for its first championship since 2014. The Mercury had a tough road to get back to the Finals for the first time in four years. They topped both the defending champion New York Liberty in the opening round and the No. 1 seed Minnesota Lynx in the semifinals to reach the WNBA Finals.",
      "The Mercury have felt they have been the underdog all season. It\u2019s no surprise with the retirement of Diana Taurasi and the departure of Brittney Griner as a free agent. The Mercury rebuilt a talented roster quickly with the additions of Alyssa Thomas, Satou Sabally and DeWanna Bonner.",
      "Kahleah Copper, one of the franchises two returning players from last season, missed the first 11 games while recovering from arthroscopic left knee surgery.",

      "Bonner was a late addition to the team, joining as a free agent midway through the year. She\u2019s no stranger to Phoenix though, helping the Mercury win titles in 2009 and 2014. After struggling for most of the playoffs, she had a huge fourth quarter in the Game 4 win over Minnesota that advanced the Mercury to the Finals.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that there were people wondering why I was playing DB at times in this series,\u201d Tibbetts said after the game. \u201cWe went and got her for this reason. I told her after the game, the first games weren\u2019t a big enough moment for her. She needed the fourth quarter to step up. And, I mean, she hit some big 3s. And you know, her experience, that\u2019s why you go get a player like that.\u201d",
      "The Aces won three of the four meetings between the teams during the regular season. A trio of the matchups were decided by six points or less.",

      "And then when Kelsey Mitchell left Game 5 on Tuesday night because of severe leg cramping, victory seemed assured for Las Vegas \u2014 only to have Indiana keep fighting back.",
      "But the Aces, pushed to the brink for the second postseason series in a row, survived 107-98 in overtime to advance to the WNBA Finals for the third time in four years. A\u2019ja Wilson, with 35 points, and Jackie Young, with 32, became the first teammates to score more than 30 points in a playoff game.",
      "The second-seeded Aces, who won the league title in 2022 and 2023, will host the fourth-seeded Phoenix Mercury on Friday in the opener of the best-of-seven championship series.",
      "Las Vegas went on a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season, but was pushed to the edge by Seattle in the first round and then Indiana.",
      "\u201cI think that streak we went on prepared us for moments like this, how to fight through the highs and lows of the game,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt allows us to never take our foot off the gas.\u201d",
      "Indiana made Las Vegas work for it even though the sixth-seeded Fever have been decimated by injuries, with Mitchell added to that list that includes Caitlin Clark and Sophie Cunningham. Coach Stephanie White somehow not only kept the team together, the Fever reached the doorstep of their first Finals appearance since 2015.",
      "\u201cThey have been an absolute joy to coach,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible group of women, an incredibly connected group. They\u2019re a great example to everybody to what it means to just put one foot in front of the other to persevere, to welcome people into the fold, to not give in to circumstance.\"",
      "Mitchell had scored a team-high 15 points at the time of her injury. Six Fever players reached double digits, including Odyssey Sims with 27 points and Natasha Howard with 16. Aliyah Boston finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds, but fouled out with 27 seconds left in regulation.",
      "The Aces were closer to a three-woman show, with Wilson coming within three points of her playoff career high. Young, whose putback basket in the opening round against Seattle allowed Las Vegas to advance to this round, had a playoff career-high 10 assists.",
      "Chelsea Gray \u2014 who briefly went into the locker room in early in the third quarter with an apparent right leg injury \u2014 scored 17 points, including eight in overtime.",

      "After Young made two free throws with 27.1 seconds remaining, Sims answered with a drive down the lane for a layup with 22.5 seconds to go to again tie the game. Young missed a layup in the closing seconds and Jewell Loyd the follow to send the game to overtime.",

      "NEW YORK -- Aaron Boone planned to lift starter Max Fried after the sixth inning of Game 1 of the New York Yankees' AL Wild Card Series against the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night. Fried inducing a double play and sitting on 99 pitches prompted Boone to reconsider and let his ace lefty get get one more out in the seventh.",
      "Fried did that, and then Boone went to his bullpen. Luke Weaver walked the first batter he faced, and then allowed a double and Masataka Yoshida\u2019s pinch-hit two-run single. David Bednar gave up back-to-back hits in the ninth to give Boston some breathing room, and the Yankees manager's in-game pitching decisions were under the microscope yet again in the aftermath of a 3-1 loss that put New York on the brink of elimination in the best-of-three opening round.",
      "Boone defended his decision on the basis that Fried faced increased pressure in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings and had to work hard to get through them.",
      "\u201cI felt like his command was not as good those final few,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s just making so many big pitches, and his stuff was good. He gave us what we needed and felt really good about the outing he put forth, but I felt pretty convicted. Especially we got the double play, it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s go get one more hitter and be good.\u2019\u201d",
      "Fried allowed just four hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings and threw 63 of his 102 pitches for strikes, and the Yankees led 1-0 on Anthony Volpe's solo home run. Fried beat Jarren Duran in a race to first base for the final out he recorded and felt he \u201chad enough in the tank for whatever the team needed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI definitely felt good at the end, coming out feeling good,\u201d Fried said. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in until I get the ball taken from me.\u201d",
      "Boone made that call and handed it to Weaver, who has not been the same since returning in June from a stint on the injured list with a strained left hamstring. The righty had a 1.05 ERA in his first 24 appearances before getting hurt and then a 5.31 over his final 40 games.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take Weave there at the bottom of the order, especially with an out in the books,\u201d Boone said.",
      "Weaver started Ceddanne Rafaela off with two strikes before walking him in an 11-pitch plate appearance. It snowballed from there with Nick Sogard doubling, Yoshida driving in two. Weaver didn't record an out and exited with the Yankees trailing.",
      "\u201cThey put a good approach together, put the ball in play and found the holes,\u201d Weaver said, describing his pitching as competitive. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of disappointed people, including myself, but I just got to be better.\u201d",
      "There were plenty of pregame decisions questioned, too, with left-handed hitters Ben Rice, Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Ryan McMahon not in the lineup against Boston starter Garrett Crochet, who got 23 outs before fellow lefty Aroldis Chapman recorded the final four to close it out. Crochet retired 17 consecutive batters after Volpe homered.",

      "San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has clarified his comments about Jacksonville coach Liam Coen's staff being \"elite at sign stealing in a legal fashion.\"",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said Tuesday his choice of words was poor when he said Jacksonville coach Liam Coen's staff was elite at sign stealing in a legal fashion.",
      "Saleh's comments last week led to a postgame dustup on the field between Saleh and Coen on Sunday after Jacksonville beat San Francisco, with players keeping the coaches apart as they yelled back and forth at each other.",
      "\u201cIn my heart, genuinely, I was trying to give a compliment,\u201d Saleh said Tuesday. \u201cI own the fact that I probably used the wrong choice of words, but however you want to word it, I mean, they\u2019re really, really good at putting their players in position to be successful. As coaches, we\u2019re always chasing leverage. They\u2019re trying to have winning leverage. We\u2019re trying to take leverage away. Everyone in the league is trying to find every avenue they can. As a coach watching their tape, I recognize the amount of hours that must be spent to be able to build formations and to find every little indicator they can to give their players a chance to be in a successful position.\u201d",
      "Saleh stressed last week when he made the initial comments that everything Jacksonville was doing was legal, but the Jaguars were apparently still offended by it, as evidenced by Coen yelling at Saleh to \u201ckeep my name out of your mouth\u201d and quarterback Trevor Lawrence saying it added fuel to the team.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that ultimately, you\u2019re always looking for an edge,\u201d Coen said Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for an edge as a player, as a coach, you always go back and look at Michael Jordan making up things of what players, people say about him to get him juiced up for a game and it\u2019s just part of the competitiveness within our profession and the way this thing goes and I thought everybody kind of worked off that a little bit.\u201d",
      "Saleh said he tried to explain his stance to Coen after the game but was unable to do so because of the yelling back and forth. He said the two haven't talked since.",

      "\u201cThe intent was to say exactly what I just said, that I think he\u2019s doing a really nice job, which I do,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cThat football team is playing and taking on his personality. They\u2019re playing violently on the offensive line and their running backs are running really hard. I think they\u2019re doing a really, really nice job and I just wanted to let him know that I appreciate the way he\u2019s going about his business with his football team.\u201d",

      "James was named to the All-NBA second team last year after averaging 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds while staying largely healthy and playing in 70 games.

      "Roger Federer leads the list of nominees announced Wednesday for the International Tennis Hall of Fame\u2019s class of 2026. He was the first man to win 20 Grand Slam singles titles and ushered in an era of unprecedented greatness with younger rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.",
      "With a terrific forehand and serve, an attacking, all-court style and footwork that helped make everything seem so effortless, Federer won 103 trophies and 1,251 matches in singles, totals surpassed among men only by Jimmy Connors in the Open era, which began in 1968.",
      "Federer finished five seasons at No. 1 in the ATP rankings, spent a record 237 consecutive weeks in that spot, led Switzerland to the 2014 Davis Cup title and teamed with Stan Wawrinka to claim a doubles gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.",
      "At the height of his powers, Federer reached a record 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005-07, capturing eight titles in that span; he extended that dominance by making 18 of 19 major finals into 2010. There also were streaks of 36 quarterfinals in a row and 23 straight semifinals.",
      "Federer, an ambassador for the game who often spoke in English, French and Swiss German at news conferences, played his last match at Wimbledon in 2021. He was a month shy of 40 at the time.",
      "His retirement announcement didn't come until the following year, and he bid farewell with an appearance alongside Nadal in doubles at the Laver Cup, an event his management company founded.",
      "Federer is joined in the Hall's player category on the ballot by two-time major singles champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro. There are two nominees in the contributor category: TV announcer Mary Carillo and administrator Marshall Happer.",
      "The inductees will be announced in November.",
      "Federer is among eight men with at least one singles trophy from each of the sport's four most important events, winning eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open. He completed his career Grand Slam at Roland-Garros in 2009.",
      "His first major championship came at the All England Club in 2003, and he broke Pete Sampras' then-record for a man of 14 Slam titles by winning Wimbledon in 2009, defeating Andy Roddick 16-14 in the fifth set of the final.",
      "Eventually, Federer was overtaken in the Grand Slam standings by Nadal, who retired last year at age 38 with 22, and Djokovic, who is still active at 38 with 24.",

Is it better to have super dominant years or come back from injury? I don\u2019t know. It really is impossible to grasp.\u201d",
      "Federer's run of five consecutive U.S. Opens \u2014 no man has won two in a row there since \u2014 ended in the 2009 final with a five-set loss to del Potro. At the time, del Potro was not quite 21 and seemed destined for an elite career thanks in part to his booming forehand, but a series of wrist and knee injuries derailed the 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Argentine.",
      "He ended up with 22 tour-level titles and a career-high ranking of No. 3, while reaching one other Grand Slam final, finishing as the runner-up to Djokovic at the 2018 U.S. Open. Del Potro earned a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics and helped Argentina win the Davis Cup that year. His last appearance at a major tournament was a fourth-round run at the 2019 French Open.",

      "CLEVELAND -- Detroit Tigers catcher Dillon Dingler knew two hours before the first pitch in Game 1 of the AL Wild Card Series against Cleveland on Tuesday that Tarik Skubal was going to be more dominant than usual.",
      "\u201cAs soon as he walked through the door I saw the intensity,\" Dingler said. \u201cIt was fun to be a part of.\u201d",
      "After being a part of two frustrating losses to the Guardians the past two weeks as the Tigers spiraled through a historic collapse that cost them the AL Central title, Skubal was determined that Detroit would seize the early momentum in the best-of-three playoff series.",
      "The left-hander tied Detroit's postseason record with 14 strikeouts in 7 2/3 overpowering innings as the Tigers beat the Guardians 2-1.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to take the ball Game 1. And it doesn\u2019t really matter how we got here. We got in,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same boat. And we\u2019re up 1-0 in a best-of-three. So it doesn\u2019t really matter how you get here, as long as you get in.\u201d",
      "Skubal equaled Joe Coleman\u2019s team mark of 14 strikeouts in Game 3 of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics.",
      "\u201cI understand, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. Winning is what matters to me. It\u2019s mattered to me all year,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cI think winning is the most important thing in sports. It\u2019s why you play, is to win.\u201d",
      "Skubal, favored to win his second straight AL Cy Young Award, went 13-6 during the regular season with an AL-low 2.21 ERA. He ranked second in strikeouts with 241. However, the Tigers lost each of Skubal's final three starts, including two vs. Cleveland, and ended up with a wild card after blowing a big division lead.",
      "It was all part of Detroit going an AL-worst 7-17 in September. Meanwhile, the Guardians won 19 of their final 23 games and rallied from 15 1/2 games back in early July to win their second consecutive AL Central crown.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of pitcher. Most guys that are pitching for that day are intense and more focused,\u201d Dingler said. \u201cHe has the ability to be the same person \u2014 like joke around like he would usually be \u2014 and lock it in. Today he was straight business.\u201d",
      "Skubal also showed he wasn't shaken, pitching on the same mound where one week ago he threw a 99 mph fastball that struck Cleveland designated hitter David Fry in the nose and face during the sixth inning.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an emotional leader. There\u2019s a great presence with him. Everything changes the day that he pitches, which is what should be around an ace,\u201d Tigers manager A.J.

      "Skubal's slider was his second-least used pitch during the regular season, but he went to the slider often on Tuesday. His 28 sliders were the most he's thrown in a game since his third season in the majors in 2022.",
      "Cleveland batters whiffed on 26 pitches, tied for the second-most against Skubal this season.",

      "The hyper-competitiveness of a 17-game season in a league that has passed $23 billion in annual revenue has created an environment of military-like precision around the lead-up to each game and luxury-resort-like support for the players along the way to help them achieve optimal performance each time they take the field. Those standards aren't lowered when teams travel, whether across the river to Wisconsin where the Vikings play rival Green Bay each year or across the ocean to Europe, where they're settled in this week between games.",
      "The pallets in the advance shipment were stacked with far more than just ankle tape and ice packs.",
      "\u201cRanch dressing, barbeque sauces, cereals that they\u2019re used to eating,\u201d said head performance dietitian Ben Hawkins.",

      "Moving two road games out of difficult-to-play-in stadiums \u2014 from Pittsburgh and Cleveland \u2014 to neutral sites where both opponents had to take long flights, adjust body clocks and prepare in unfamiliar surroundings was a plus. The expertise of the team's talented and tireless support staff, from athletic training, equipment and nutrition to operations and security, made the decision even easier.",

      "Chicago also got a perfect performance from its bullpen in the franchise's first playoff win since the 2017 National League Championship Series. The Cubs were swept by Miami in the wild-card round in 2020 during their last postseason appearance.",
      "Game 2 of the best-of-three series is back at Wrigley Field on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll in all, a really good day for us,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHaving a chance to clinch tomorrow and move to the next round is all you can ask for.\u201d",
      "Suzuki opened the fifth inning with a 424-foot drive to left-center off Nick Pivetta, tying it at 1 and sending a charge through a towel-waving crowd of 39,114 on a picturesque day. Pivetta had retired 11 in a row before Suzuki extended his homer streak to five games going back to the regular season.",
      "Kelly followed with a towering shot that drifted just over the wall in left-center. The catcher and Chicago native held his right arm in the air as he rounded first base.",
      "It was the MLB postseason debut for both Suzuki and Kelly, who combined for the franchise's first set of back-to-back homers in the playoffs since Miguel Montero and Dexter Fowler went deep on Oct. 15, 2016, against the Dodgers.",
      "\u201cSimply put, it was fantastic,\u201d Suzuki said through a translator. \u201cYou just felt the passion of the fans, them cheering us on. Rounding the bases, I felt some nerves, obviously, but great feeling overall.\u201d",
      "Pivetta struck out nine in five solid innings, but San Diego's lineup was shut down by Matthew Boyd and four relievers.",
      "Jackson Merrill and Xander Bogaerts produced an early lead for the Padres with back-to-back doubles in the second. Bogaerts advanced to third on center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong's throwing error, but he was stranded there when Boyd retired Ryan O'Hearn (grounder to shortstop), Gavin Sheets (popup to third) and Jake Cronenworth (grounder to shortstop).",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Ron Washington will not return for a third season as the manager of the Los Angeles Angels, the team announced Tuesday.",
      "Washington missed roughly half of the current season after undergoing quadruple bypass heart surgery. The Angels said they will hire a new manager for 2026, which means interim manager Ray Montgomery also won't get the job.",
      "The 73-year-old Washington was the oldest manager in the majors during his two seasons with the Angels, who hired him in November 2023. Los Angeles had the worst season in franchise history in 2024, going 63-99 after the free-agency departure of two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani.",
      "The Angels went 72-90 this season and finished last in the AL West for the second straight season under Washington and Montgomery, the bench coach who stepped up in late June after Washington was sidelined by his health issues. Washington was back around the Angels in uniform at the close of the season, but he didn't resume managerial duties.",
      "Angels general manager Perry Minasian and owner Arte Moreno made no public comment about the decision, but Washington told The Athletic that Minasian claimed they made the move because of the team's performance, not his health.",
      "\u201cI have to accept that,\u201d Washington told The Athletic. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to argue with them to try and tell them different when they\u2019ve made a decision. \u2026 We were starting to perform better.\u201d",
      "Minasian didn't respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. The GM is under contract through next season, which will be his sixth in charge of the losing club.",
      "Washington repeatedly said he hoped to return as manager next season, but Moreno has decided to make yet another change to a struggling franchise that has endured 10 consecutive losing seasons and 11 straight non-playoff seasons \u2014 both the longest active streaks in the majors.",
      "Washington had success during his tenure as the Texas Rangers' manager from 2007-14, reaching two World Series while making three playoff appearances and posting five straight winning seasons. He moved on to coaching roles in Oakland and Atlanta, and he won a World Series ring with the Braves in 2021.",
      "But he couldn't save the long-inept Angels despite remaining popular with his players and Orange County fans.",

      "The Angels also paid $38.5 million this season to third baseman Anthony Rendon, who didn't play in 2025 due to a lingering hip injury. Rendon, who hasn't played more than 58 games in any of his six seasons with Los Angeles after Moreno signed him in late 2019, still has one year left on one of the most disastrous free-agent contracts in major league history.",

      "The Minnesota Lynx star spoke for more than four minutes on topics ranging from Caitlin Clark \u2014 and her value to the league \u2014 to inconsistent officiating, which she feels Engelbert and the WNBA haven't addressed.",
      "\u201cWe have the best league in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But we have the worst leadership in the world,\u201d the runner-up for MVP said. \u201cYear after year, the only thing that remains consistent is the lack of accountability from our leaders.\"",
      "During what typically would be a routine end-of-season media availability, Collier blasted Engelbert as a leader who is insensitive to the current realities of being a WNBA player. Her remarks came as the WNBA players union, for which Collier is a vice president, prepares to engage the league in highly contentious collective bargaining that will set the parameters for a league trying to keep up with its unprecedented growth and global interest.",
      "\"If I didn\u2019t know exactly what the job entailed, maybe I wouldn\u2019t feel this way,\" Collier said. \"But unfortunately for them, I do believe we serve a league that has shown they think championship coaches and Hall of Fame players are dispensable, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s professional sports, but I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level.\u201d",
      "Engelbert responded to Collier in a statement not long after the media session, saying she was disheartened by \u201chow Napheesa characterized our conversations,\u201d but was committed to her job and \"will not waver.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have the utmost respect for Napheesa Collier and for all the players in the WNBA,\" Engelbert wrote. \u201cTogether we have all worked tirelessly to transform this league. My focus remains on ensuring a bright future for the players and the WNBA, including collaborating on how we continue to elevate the game.\u201d",
      "Many fans at Tuesday night's Game 5 semifinal in Las Vegas between the Aces and Indiana Fever booed the regular pregame video in which Engelbert promoted good fan sportsmanship.",
      "Things have been heated in Minnesota as of late. The Lynx were eliminated from the playoffs on Sunday in a Game 4 that Collier missed with an ankle injury and her coach, Cheryl Reeve, missed because she was suspended for her behavior toward officials in Game 3.",
      "Reeve also received what was believed to be the heftiest fine for an individual coach or player in league history, according to a person familiar with the penalty who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because an official announcement hadn't been made yet.",
      "Collier said she hadn\u2019t heard from Engelbert following her injury, which happened on the play that prompted Reeve to take to the court and scream at officials before her staff and players held her back in an attempt to defuse the situation.",
      "\u201cNot one call, not one text. Instead, the only outreach has come from her No. 2 telling my agent that she doesn\u2019t believe physical play contributed to injuries. That is infuriating,\u201d Collier said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect example of the tone deaf, dismissive approach that our leaders always seem to take.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis past February, I sat across from (Engelbert) and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league,\u201d Collier said. \u201cHer response was, \u2018Well, only the losers complain about the refs.\u2019 I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like (Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers), who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league and are making so little for their first four years.",

Earnings for top rookies are capped around $78,000.",

      "Even without Aleksander Barkov, the Panthers have a chance to do something no NHL team has done in more than 40 years. And in between the rest of the league trying to stop their dynasty, the world's best hockey players will return to the Olympics for the first time in over a decade, fresh off the wildly successful 4 Nations Face-Off that reminded fans just how good the game is on the international stage.",

      "The second-biggest spender, the Mets, didn't even make the 12-team postseason despite spending $428.8 million \u2014 which represents a decrease of about $1.5 million from 2024. The Mets payroll after in-season moves is $339.7 million and they project to pay $89.1 million in tax.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",

      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,\" the Free University of Berlin\u2019s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.",
      "The scientists favor new missions to further explore Enceladus. Launched in 1997, Cassini is long gone; the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn in 2017 following its joint mission by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- An offshore earthquake of magnitude 6.9 collapsed walls of houses and buildings late Tuesday in a central Philippine province, killing at least 31 people, injuring many others and sending residents scrambling out of homes into darkness as the intense shaking cut off power, officials said.",
      "The epicenter of the earthquake, which was set off by movement in a local fault at a depth of 5 kilometers (3 miles), was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Bogo, a coastal city of about 90,000 people in Cebu province where at least 14 residents died, disaster-mitigation officer Rex Ygot told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "The death toll in Bogo was expected to rise. Workers were trying to transport a backhoe to hasten search and rescue efforts in a cluster of shanties in a mountain village hit by a landslide and boulders, he said.",

      "Reynes appealed for food and water, saying San Remigio's water system was damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Aside from houses in Bogo, the quake damaged a fire station and concrete and asphalt roads, firefighter Rey Ca\u00f1ete said.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "After buying Twitter for $44.5 billion, Musk later became major contributor to Trump\u2019s successful 2024 campaign that resulted in his re-election and then spent several months leading a cost-cutting effort that purged thousands of workers from the federal government payroll before the two had a bitter falling out. Both Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech leaders who lined up behind Trump during his second inauguration in January in a show of solidarity that was widely interpreted as a sign of the industry\u2019s intention to work more closely with the president than during his first administration.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "The company is taking action after AI chatbot safety for young users has hit the headlines. The technology's dangers have been recently highlighted by a number of cases in which teenagers took their lives after interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",

      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",

Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",

      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",

      "Other responses, even from the president\u2019s base, remain unconvinced (as one X user griped under the White House post of Trump as pope: \u201cI voted for you, but this is weird and creepy. More mass deportations and less of whatever this is.\u201d).",

      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",

      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

      "\u201cNot everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,\u201d he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, \"telling them, \u2018I know that there\u2019s a workforce shortage but here's a bot' \u2014 that is such a privileged position.\u201d",

      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",

      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",

      "The vote was ruffled by a foreign influence scandal in 2018 when self-styled comedians in Australia cast hundreds of fraudulent votes for a bird that shares its name with an Antipodean slang term for sex. Voters must now verify the email addresses used to cast their votes.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",
      "Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of what\u2019s the price and will the regulator approve it,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThe challenge is they\u2019re not going to come up for sale very often.\u201d",
      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",
      "The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don\u2019t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice known for his jurist sensibilities and traditionalist convictions on marriage and religious freedom, is expected to be the next president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its more than 17 million members worldwide.",
      "The leadership transition follows the recent death of President Russell M. Nelson and comes as many of the church\u2019s U.S. members are reeling from a deadly attack on a Michigan congregation and a high-profile assassination in Utah where the denomination known widely as the Mormon church is headquartered.",
      "Oaks is the longest-tenured member of a top body of leaders called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. That makes him next in line to be president under a tradition established more than a century ago to ensure a smooth handover and prevent any lobbying internally or publicly. The formal announcement likely will come at some point after Nelson's funeral on Oct. 7. He was 101 when he died Saturday.",
      "At 93, Oaks will be among the oldest presidents. Seven of the past nine have served into their nineties, including five beyond Oaks' current age.",
      "For a faith that prioritizes being welcoming \u2014 especially at local churches on Sundays \u2014 last weekend's attack on a worship service in Michigan was shocking.",
      "Services in Grand Blanc Township had just started when a former Marine rammed his pickup truck into the church and started shooting. Four people died and eight were wounded in Sunday\u2019s attack about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Detroit. The attacker lit a fire before being chased and killed in an exchange of gunfire with police.",
      "\u201cWe all seek answers and understanding in the wake of trauma, shock, and grief. We are grateful to all who are reaching out with service, prayers, and words of support during this difficult time,\u201d Oaks said in a statement that also paid tribute to Nelson.",
      "Nelson's \u201ctimeless teachings\u201d help people find comfort amid suffering, Oaks said.",
      "Utah is also still reeling from the Sept. 10 shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. His alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, grew up as a church member.",
      "Violence could be a talking point this weekend at the church's twice-annual general conference in Salt Lake City, said Matthew Bowman, a Claremont Graduate University professor specializing in U.S. religious history. Church leaders often address major issues of the moment while leaving some room for the nearly 100,000 in-person attendees and many more watching remotely to interpret religious doctrine for themselves.",
      "Church policy allows only law enforcement officers to bring guns and other lethal weapons on church property. It's unclear whether new measures are coming.",
      "A longtime prominent voice in the church, Oaks joined the Quorum of the Twelve in 1984 around the same time as Nelson.",
      "When Nelson became president, he elevated Oaks to the First Presidency, the top governing body.",
      "\u201cI suspect that Oaks has had a fairly strong hand in leadership through Nelson\u2019s presidency,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re not going to see a very tremendous pivot.\u201d",
      "Early on as an apostle, Oaks was involved in a crackdown on far-right extremism that resulted in some excommunications. In 2020, he gave a speech about having faith in elections without resorting to radicalism or violence.",
      "Whereas Nelson focused on the faith's global footprint, including picking apostles with international and immigrant backgrounds, Oaks may refocus on the U.S. and its politics, Bowman said.",
      "With Nelson\u2019s death, there is a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks would fill as president \u2014 one way church presidents can leave their imprint. Some wonder if he will tap the church's commissioner of education, Clark Gilbert, who has led efforts at the church-owned Brigham Young University campuses to enforce church orthodoxy, Bowman said.",
      "Oaks has been a driving force against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin, creating anxiety and concern among the faithful who are gay, lesbian and transgender.",
      "He often delivered speeches reinforcing the faith's stance, including one in which he said the intended meaning of \u201cgender\u201d in church doctrine is \u201cbiological sex at birth.\u201d Church policies introduced in 2024 significantly restricted involvement of members who have transitioned physically or socially, such as changing their name or pronouns.",

      "Yet in recent years Oaks has been part of a few key church moves that suggest he might not make the topic a centerpiece of his administration, experts say.",
      "Oaks was Nelson\u2019s closest adviser in 2019 when Nelson rescinded a policy that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion. The move reversed a decision that was devastating and confusing to gay and lesbian church members who had been buoyed in previous years by church leaders\u2019 calls for more love and understanding for LGBTQ+ members.",
      "\u201cIt would be really unlikely that he would, you know, go back on that when he was one of the decision-makers in removing that restriction,\u201d said Paul Reeve, Simmons Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Utah.",
      "Oaks also helped the church strike a compromise in 2022 in which the faith backed proposed federal legislation to safeguard same-sex marriages so long as those laws didn\u2019t infringe upon religious liberty or force the faith to perform same-sex marriages or grant them official church sanction.",
      "Noah Hanson, who is gay and grew up in the religion, worries Oaks\u2019 ascension will drive a greater wedge between LGBTQ+ people and their devout family members. Under Nelson, the church largely backed off talking about homosexuality, Hanson said, giving his parents the space to \u201cmake a little progress.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve started telling my husband that they love him,\u201d said the 27-year-old from Logan, Utah.",
      "If Oaks is as outspoken about LGBTQ+ people as he has been in the past, Hanson worries that progress will slip. His parents revere church presidents, who are considered prophets by members, even if their policies are harmful to their own children, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Dallin H. Oaks doesn\u2019t soften his stances on how marriage is only between a man and a woman, or that the act of homosexuality is a sin, like if he lays down that hammer, I feel like that\u2019s gonna ruin my relationship with my parents,\u201d Hanson said.",
      "Well known for dry sermons and speeches that appeal more to reason than emotion, Oaks brings a jurist\u2019s sensibility to his work. Compared to Nelson\u2019s sentimentalism, Oaks is cooler, more precise and lawyerly, Bowman said.",
      "Becoming president, though, could inspire him to adopt a more personal approach, suggested Patrick Mason, a religious studies and history professor at Utah State University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very different thing to be president of the church and to recognize that now you are meant to be all things to all people within the church,\u201d Mason said.",
      "Oaks has been outspoken about maintaining civil public discourse, urging people shortly before the 2024 presidential election to \u201cavoid what is harsh and hateful\u201d and be peacemakers in their communities.",
      "Following anti-vaccine backlash from church members after celebrating the COVID-19 vaccines on social media, Nelson and Oaks began talking more about the need for moderation, political dialogue and avoiding conspiracy theories and hate.",
      "\u201cThat really, I think, alarmed Nelson, and it alarmed Oaks,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think this is back on Oaks\u2019 radar, that political extremism in the church is a problem. And he may be, I think because of his training and because of his background, perhaps more willing than Nelson was to take concrete steps.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Recent U.S. escalations in the Caribbean are a result of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's \u201cpersonal\u201d agenda against the region, Cuba's top diplomat said, adding that his American counterpart is increasingly pushing policies that do not align with President Donald Trump's so-called mandate for peace.",
      "Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla told The Associated Press that Cuba saw a possibility of changing the longstanding antagonistic dynamic between the United States and the communist-run island when Trump returned to office in January. But he added that Rubio, who was born to Cuban immigrants, has made it his mission for Washington to adopt an even stronger \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Havana.",
      "\u201cThe current secretary of state was not born in Cuba, has never been to Cuba, and knows nothing about Cuba,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a sit-down interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cBut there is a very personal and corrupt agenda that he is carrying out, which seems to be sacrificing the national interests of the U.S. in order to advance this very extremist approach.\u201d",
      "The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. Rubio and U.S. officials have defended their aggressive stance against Cuba, accusing its leaders of running a dictatorship.",
      "\"The U.S. will continue to stand for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cuba, and make clear no illegitimate, dictatorial regimes are welcome in our hemisphere,\u201d Rubio said in a July statement.",
      "The foreign minister and other Cuban officials have been toeing the diplomatic lines with the Trump administration as they seek an end to a six-decade-long U.S. economic embargo, which, while failing to overthrow the government, has caused widespread energy blackouts, food shortages and inflation.",
      "In public statements and speeches, officials have strayed away from directly criticizing Trump for the series of aggressive actions his administration has taken against Cuba in the first eight months of his second term.

      "Authorization for the largest residential flood insurance program in the U.S. is set to expire at the end of Tuesday",
      "Authorization for the largest residential flood insurance program in the U.S. is set to expire Tuesday, leaving homeowners unable to access new coverage and potentially wreaking havoc on home sales in flood-prone areas.",
      "Millions of policyholders rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to secure flood coverage that is rarely part of standard homeowners policies and is required for mortgages in areas deemed high-risk. If Congress is unable to pass a spending bill before midnight Tuesday, the NFIP, like much of the federal government, will freeze.",
      "Claims could still be paid, but with two months left in the Atlantic hurricane season and winter weather on its way, homeowners and renters would be unable to buy, renew, or add to policies.",
      "That would also thwart real estate transactions where mortgages require flood insurance. Lenders are prohibited from issuing government-backed mortgages for properties in FEMA-designated \u201c special flood hazard areas \u201d unless the building or mobile home is covered by flood insurance. Since private insurance does not offer flood coverage in many parts of the U.S., buyers often depend on the NFIP.",
      "\u201cEach day a shutdown continues, the effects on the housing sector grow,\u201d said Shannon McGahn, executive vice president and chief advocacy officer at the National Association of Realtors.",
      "NFIP supports nearly half a million home sales annually, according to NAR. Past lapses have shown the potential impact on the market: During a roughly 30-day freeze in June 2010, NAR estimated 1,400 home sales were canceled or delayed each day.",
      "The problem would be most acutely felt in Florida where about 14,800 monthly home sale closings depend on securing flood insurance. Texas, with 3,500 monthly closings, would also be impacted.",
      "Flood insurance access is \"just one of the many ways the extended shutdown could worsen the outlook for the housing market across the country,\u201d said Francis Torres, associate director for housing and infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, citing housing vouchers and FHA-backed loans for first-time home buyers as other areas that could be undermined by limited funds and staff.",
      "\u201cThere is a direct through-line between a protracted shutdown and worsening conditions for the nation's housing crisis,\u201d said Torres.",

The over 22,500 communities participating in the program must adopt minimum standards to access the program.",
      "The FEMA-managed program has over 4.7 million policies representing $1.3 trillion in coverage.",
      "NFIP\u2019s last long-term reauthorization was in 2012. Since the end of 2017, its continuation has depended on 33 short-term reauthorizations. The last time the program lapsed was for 13 hours in March 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Lawmakers, industry groups and policyholders have long called for NFIP reform to give the program stability and to address issues with floodplain mapping, affordability and solvency.",
      "Floods are the \u201cmost common and widespread\u201d type of disaster in the U.S., according the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, occurring in every state and territory and putting pressure on the insurance system. But not everyone who needs flood insurance has it. The Government Accountability Office has found that FEMA maps \u201cmay not reflect current flood risks.\u201d",
      "The NFIP has also struggled to set premium prices that balance affordability with solvency, according to the GAO. The program borrows from the U.S. Treasury when it cannot payout claims and currently owes almost $23 billion.",
      "A group of House lawmakers introduced a bill last week to reauthorize the program until Nov. 21. But Congress must look at a longer term solution, said Amanda Devecka-Rinear, executive director of the disaster-survivor advocacy group New Jersey Organizing Project. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to storm survivors and their communities to have this unpredictability and instability.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- After years of failed attempts, Republicans in Nebraska have enacted a measure that uses taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuition, despite voters repealing a newly-passed state law that would fund private school tuition with state dollars.",
      "Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed an executive order opting the state into a federal school choice tax credit program included in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and budget bill passed in July.",
      "\"I am not opting this in, I am cannonballing it into the state of Nebraska,\u201d Pillen said as he announced the move Monday at Catholic school in Lincoln. He was joined by Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith, both of Nebraska, who supported the federal budget bill and private school scholarship plan.",
      "The measure is remarkably similar to one the state Legislature passed in 2023 to allow corporations and individuals to divert millions of dollars they owe in state income taxes to nonprofit organizations, which would in turn award that money as private school tuition scholarships. Lawmakers axed the measure the following year after opponents gathered far more signatures than was needed to ask voters to repeal it. The Legislature then passed a new law funding private school scholarships directly from state coffers.",
      "The new federal law that Pillen opted into allows individual taxpayers to direct up to $1,700 in federal income taxes owed to scholarship-granting groups to be used for eligible K-12 private school expenses. But unlike Nebraska's 2023 proposal, the federal measure allows even high-income households to receive public money for private school costs. Eligibility extends to families earning up to 300% of the area median gross income, according to the Nebraska State Education Association \u2014 the state\u2019s largest teachers union.",

      "A major US-Africa trade deal, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, has ended, cutting duty-free access to U.S. markets for thousands of African products",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Workers and industry are bracing for the end of a longstanding U.S. trade agreement that gave African exporters preferential treatment and now leaves businesses vulnerable to new competitive pressures and tariffs.",
      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act will terminate as scheduled Tuesday amid uncertainty over renegotiations and the looming impact of new tariffs announced by the White House in April.",
      "AGOA is a multilateral trade agreement that has given thousands of products from qualifying African nations duty-free access to U.S. markets since 2000.",
      "A key example of the deal's impact can be found in Kenya, where it has allowed the country\u2019s textile and apparel sector \u2014 makers of jeans, for instance \u2014 to effectively compete with Asian exporters such as in Bangladesh and Vietnam.",
      "\u201cIf AGOA goes away we have zero chance to compete with the Asian countries,\u201d said Pankaj Bedi, owner of United Aryan, an apparel manufacturer in Nairobi that exports Levi's and Wrangler jeans to the U.S.",
      "Textile and apparel exports from Kenya to the U.S. have grown from around $50 million when AGOA was first introduced to around $500 million today.",
      "\u201cI will be asking (Trump) for the U.S. to consider seriously renewing and extending AGOA for at least a minimum of five years,\u201d Kenyan President William Ruto said last week at the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cIt is a platform that connects Africa and the U.S. in a very fundamental way.\u201d",
      "AGOA had also given African countries hope that major elements of their export economies would be exempt from blanket tariffs of 10% \u2014 and in some cases much higher \u2014 announced by the U.S. earlier this year.",
      "Kenya is already paying 10% on non-AGOA exports, which are not many. Kenyan manufacturers will struggle to compete with rivals in Asia, even though some Asian countries may face a higher U.S. tariff, because of the limited domestic supply chain in Kenya where most of the raw materials are imported, as well as higher energy costs, lending rates, and operating expenses.",
      "Ruto and other African leaders are pushing for a last-minute renegotiation of AGOA while also scrambling to sign new bilateral agreements with the U.S. They are doing so amid a period of seismic change in global trade dynamics and with a White House that shows a mixed commitment to Africa.",
      "\u201cAfrican countries including Kenya must be alive to the possibility that AGOA won\u2019t be extended, AGOA won\u2019t be remodified, and \u2026 America won\u2019t be interested in having a trade pact,\u201d said Raphael Obonyo, a public policy expert at UN Habitat.",
      "Ruto said last week that Kenya and the U.S had made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a bilateral agreement that could be signed by the end of this year.",
      "AGOA has mostly benefitted African economies in both big and small industries. The agreement has helped both the continent\u2019s largest exporters \u2014 Nigerian and Angolan oil, South African autos, and Kenyan clothing\u2014as well as some of its smallest economies where exports are highly concentrated, such as Lesotho and Eswatini.",

      "New York \u2014\u00a0Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \"Diddy\" Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\"His crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\" they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "Prosecutors called Combs \"unrepentant\" and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \"incredibly ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday. The music mogul had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges brought against him.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars and that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly rather than violently to threats, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",
      "They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim.",
      "\"He is not the victim,\" they wrote. \"The Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant's conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.\"",
      "At trial, two of Combs' former girlfriends testified that they felt forced to participate in the drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed.",
      "Ex-girlfriends tell court about treatment by Coombs",
      "R&B singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura described being beaten by Combs when she displeased him during their decadelong relationship. Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face.",
      "In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial \"in front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\"",
      "Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet.",
      "\"These events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces,\" she said.",
      "Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope.",
      "\"My worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,\" Cassie said.",
      "The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",

      "The daughter of Sicilian parents, her career began after winning a beauty pageant in Tunisia at age 17. That led to a trip to the Venice Film Festival, and offers to appear in movies. She turned them down, at first. \"It's like a man,\" she told The Guardian in 2013. \"When he's going after you, if you say yes immediately, after a little time he goes away. If you say no, he desires you for a long time.\"",
      "Often compared to Brigitte Bardot, Cardinale found success working with such directors as Mario Monicelli (\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\"), Luchino Visconti (\"Rocco and His Brothers,\" \"The Leopard,\" \"Conversation Piece\"), Sergio Leone (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\") and Werner Herzog (\"Fitzcarraldo\").",
      "She appeared in some Hollywood productions, including \"The Pink Panther\" with Peter Sellers, \"Circus World\" with John Wayne, \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, and \"The Professionals\" with Burt Lancaster. But she refused to sign exclusivity contracts with American studios, and so the majority of her appearances were in international films.",
      "A staple of Italian and French cinema, she continued working into her 80s. Of her roles, which extended from the sultry to the grand dame, she proudly said in 2013, \"I was never naked and I never did anything to change my face. I don't like that at all. I like to be what I am, because you cannot stop time.\""

    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

      "The NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California \u2014 home of the San Francisco 49ers.",

He has become one of the world's most streamed artists with albums such as \"Un Verano Sin Ti,\" an all-Spanish-language LP.",
      "\"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,\" Bad Bunny said in a statement. \"It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown\u2026 this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.\"",
      "In a short video posted by the NFL on Sunday, the 31-year-old artist is sporting a pava, a Puerto Rican straw hat, which is a nod to Puerto Rican mid-century farmers. It shows Bad Bunny sitting on a goalpost to the tune of \"Debi Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\" The song speaks to the reality that Puerto Ricans must leave the homeland if they are to thrive. It is a song that immigrants of all origins have embraced as an anthem.",
      "The Super Bowl halftime show announcement comes on the heel of the superstar's final residency show at San Juan's El Choli. It was livestreamed on Prime Video and Twitch, breaking viewership records for a single-artist performance, according to Amazon Music.",
      "Bad Bunny's historic shows have vitalized Puerto Rico's economy, while celebrating the island's pride, culture, and resilience on the anniversary of Hurricane Maria.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \"done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage.\"",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \"Bullet Train,\" \"Caught Stealing\" and \"Happy Gilmore 2,\" and collaborated with top fashion houses. He'll enter the Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",

    "summary": "Part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, The Zombies took a lot longer for success to catch up with them. Now their most famous album, 1968's \"Odessey and Oracle,\" has been remastered.",
    "story": [
      "Remember when radio DJs used to say a hit song was \"number one with a bullet\"?\u00a0 Well, this one was the slowest bullet in rock history. \"Time of the Season,\" by The Zombies, released in March 1968, reached #3 on the Billboard charts a full year later.",
      "Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone are in their 80s now. In their teens they were members of The Zombies, part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, except that, for The Zombies, success took a lot longer to catch up with them.",
      "Of the five original Zombies, four survive: Argent, Blunstone, Hugh Grundy and Chris White. The fifth member, Paul Atkinson, died in 2004.",
      "\"We were friends, really, right from the very start,\" said Agent.",
      "\"It just clicked, yeah, it really did,\" said Grundy.",
      "White added, \"And we're still friends!\"",
      "They first got the band together at a youth club in their hometown just north of London, where a local artist has now finally put up a mural of them.",
      "But boy, was it a bumpy road to rock 'n' roll immortality.",
      "The first song Argent wrote was \"She's Not There,\" about unrequited adolescent love (is there another kind?). It was the making of them.",
      "\"She's Not There\" made it onto \"Juke Box Jury,\" a British is-it-a-hit-or-a-miss TV show, where one of the panelists loved it: \"I think it's a hit,\" he said. That panelist was George Harrison of The Beatles. It didn't hurt.",
      "The song went to #1 on the Cash Box chart, and #2 in Billboard.",
      "\"It was on the 9 o'clock news,\" said Argent. \"They said The Zombies had become the first group after The Beatles to have a number one record with a self-written composition\" - the song Argent wrote - \"Yeah, I'm in heaven!.\"",
      "\"She's Not There\" wasn't just a hit; it was their ticket to ride. They went to America, and hit the road with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars. \"This was a dream come true for us,\" said Blunstone.",
      "Grundy said, \"We were terrified because here we were taking a lot of their influence, and there we were on stage with these fabulous artists going, 'Can we do this, can we even play with them?'\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel you were being imposters bringing American-style rhythm and blues music back to America?\"",
      "\"With English accents!\" said White.",
      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",
      "But a story with a happy ending. For The Zombies, their season has finally come.",

    "summary": "The actress talks about playing a screen goddess in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"; her love of movie musicals; and her long road from the Bronx to Hollywood.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. It does. It does,\" she replied. \"And I still feel like I want to fly higher. I want to see more. I want to do more things.\"",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "summary": "A government shutdown began on Wednesday. Here's what to know about student loans, educational funding and the FAFSA.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown on Wednesday could have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises, given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Bourla called it an \"historic day\" because Pfizer would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers. We're not doing this to make more money \u2014 we're doing this to protect our business.\"",

      "A new \"Instant Checkout\" feature lets users buy products noted by the AI-powered bot in a chat without having to navigate outside the app, ChatGPT creator OpenAI\u00a0announced\u00a0Monday.",
      "For example, if you query ChatGPT for the \"best mattress under $1,000\" or \"gift for an avid reader,\" the tool will suggest relevant products. If consumers wants to purchase one of ChatGPT's recommendations, they can now do so within the chat.",
      "Currently, ChatGPT users can buy directly from U.S. Etsy sellers from within a chat. Through a partnership with Shopify, ChatGPT will soon give consumers access to more than 1 million vendors, such as cosmetic company Glossier, shapewear company SKIMS, shoemaker Steve Madden and more, according to OpenAI.",
      "The new feature marks ChatGPT's foray into so-called agentic commerce, with the app acting as a shopper's agent. In other words, ChatGPT interacts with both the buyer and the seller, while the merchant processes payment and fulfills the order. Merchants pay ChatGPT a small fee on completed transactions, OpenAI said.",
      "\"This marks the next step in agentic commerce, where ChatGPT doesn't just help you find what to buy, it also helps you buy it. For shoppers, it's seamless: go from chat to checkout in just a few taps. For sellers, it's a new way to reach hundreds of millions of people while keeping full control of their payments, systems, and customer relationships,\" OpenAI\u00a0said in a statement.",

      "Shopify\u00a0said\u00a0on Monday that it wants to allow merchants to sell to customers \"anywhere AI conversations happen,\" as more Americans rely on generative AI tools like ChatGPT to help them make decisions.",
      "\"Shopping is changing fast. People are discovering products in AI conversations, not just through search or ads,\" Vanessa Lee, VP of product at Shopify, said in an article on the company's website. \"This will let our merchants show up naturally in those moments and give shoppers a way to buy without breaking their flow. It's a really exciting shift for commerce.\"",
      "Shopify said it wants to position its merchants at the forefront of a sea change in how online commerce is conducted.",
      "\"We're making sure our merchants thrive in the era of agentic commerce,\" said Lee. \"We're helping everyone from indie brands to household names reach shoppers in entirely new ways.\"",
      "E-commerce giant Amazon is also wading into the world of agentic AI. Through its \"Buy for Me\" feature in the Amazon Shopping App, shoppers can purchase goods from vendors who don't sell their products on Amazon.com without leaving the Amazon ecosystem.",
      "\"If a customer decides to proceed with a Buy for Me purchase, they tap on the Buy for Me button on the product detail page to request Amazon make the purchase from the brand retailer's website on their behalf,\" Amazon explains on its corporate website. \"Customers are taken to an Amazon checkout page where they confirm order details, including preferred delivery address, applicable taxes and shipping fees, and payment method.\"",
      "OpenAI on Monday also said it has added new parental controls to ChatGPT aimed at protecting young users of the AI platform. The company, which allows users as young as 13 to sign up, faces public pressure to ensure\u00a0the safety of ChatGPT\u00a0for teenagers.",

Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",

      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",

      "\"The timing of the looming potential government shutdown is not ideal for the Fed, which is set to meet again on October 29th,\" said Mike Reid, senior U.S. economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, in a research report.",
      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",

      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:17:33 -0400",
    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions.

      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",
      "It's unclear if consumers who purchased these now-recalled products will be eligible for a refund. The FSIS says consumers with questions about the recall can contact Christina Self, The Hillshire Brands Company Associate Director of Customer Care, at 888-747-7611.",

      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection.

      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",

      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick.

    "story": [
      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is transitioning to electronic payments next week after 85 years of issuing paper checks to U.S. retirees.",
    "story": [
      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits. She had paid into the relatively new program for about three years, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"It wasn't that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it,\" she said.",
      "Fuller's first monthly check, issued on January 31, 1940, was for $22.54.",

      "The leakage of fumes most commonly occurs on the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody jets, a recent\u00a0Wall Street Journal investigation\u00a0found.",
      "Breathing in the toxic engine emissions can lead to general nervous system problems, Dr. Robert Harrison, an occupational medicine specialist at the University of California San Francisco who has treated more than 100 flight crew members for exposure to fumes, told CBS News.",

      "Reached for comment on the issue, United CEO Scott Kirby recently told CBS News that it is a matter he has \"personally been focused on for over a decade.\"",
      "United has a \"proactive maintenance program\" that tracks the plane engine's oil consumption and oil pressure, and proactively replaces APU seals to prevent oil leaks and oil burns that would lead to fumes entering airplane cabins, Kirby said. The issue, he added, isn't a concern on newer airplanes, like Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which have a different design.",
      "Barry Biffle, CEO of Frontier Airlines, which operates an Airbus fleet, said that while the company is following the toxic fume issue, incidents occur very rarely.",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to HUD and the White House for comment on Public Citizen's complaint and Holman's allegations.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took affect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\"",

That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S.\u00a0government shut down\u00a0Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government\u00a0shut down\u00a0Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government\u00a0shutdown\u00a0went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hourse left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The government shut down Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government began shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority expired, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department will begin shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown. On Tuesday, both proposals to extend government funding again fell short in the Senate.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "With the government shutting down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown lasts remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

But in July, shortly before that time limit ran out, the Justice Department shifted Chattah to a different job that would allow her to serve as acting U.S. attorney \u2014 a separate role that would still let Chattah lead the office.",

In a ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Campbell sided with the defendants and barred Chattah from supervising their cases. He declined to dismiss their indictments altogether.",
      "Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, if the position of U.S. attorney \u2014 a Senate-confirmed post that oversees prosecutions in a court district \u2014 becomes vacant, it is supposed to be filled automatically by the first assistant U.S. attorney, who is typically a top career prosecutor. Campbell ruled Tuesday that the Justice Department wasn't legally allowed to shift Chattah to the role of first assistant U.S. attorney in order to have her take on the acting job.",
      "\"The Court cannot accept the government's assertion that the Attorney General has power to designate anyone she chooses as first assistant and have that person become the acting U.S. Attorney,\" the judge wrote in a 32-page ruling. \"The [Federal Vacancies Reform Act] was enacted to put an end to precisely such Executive actions.\"",
      "Campbell also ruled that the Justice Department can't delegate the responsibility of overseeing criminal cases to Chattah even if she doesn't officially hold the job: \"The Court cannot conclude that Ms. Chattah's role is anything less than Acting U.S. Attorney, a position she cannot hold.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The ruling came weeks after another judge ruled on slightly different grounds that President Trump's former personal lawyer Alina Habba was serving illegally as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, removing her from a handful of criminal cases.",
      "In several states, including California and New York, the Trump administration has sought to keep federal prosecutors in temporary roles for months. Critics have accused the administration of trying to sidestep the Senate and the judiciary.",

    "summary": "Two GOP senators are raising questions about the defunding of the Council of Inspectors General.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is pulling a federal watchdog off the beat in Washington, effective Wednesday, stripping funding from the Council of Inspectors General.",
      "Removing the council's funding will mean a further hollowing out of the work of federal inspectors general and internal government investigators who are supposed to root out waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct in the administration.",
      "The council, which is an independent entity within the executive branch, is tasked with addressing \"integrity, economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual Government agencies,\" according to the council's\u00a0website.",
      "The Trump administration argues the inspectors general are \"corrupt.\"",
      "\"Inspectors general are meant to be impartial watchdogs identifying waste and corruption on behalf of the American people,\" a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget told CBS News in a statement. \"Unfortunately, they have become corrupt, partisan, and in some cases, have lied to the public. The American people will no longer be funding this corruption.\"",
      "The council, often referred to as CIGIE, helps train, equip and provide investigative expertise to the dozens of federal inspectors general. Its staff helps operate hotlines for tips, hosts websites for the inspectors and provides data analysis and investigative tools to help with probes. CIGIE helps support nearly 14,000 federal investigative employees, according to a former CIGIE official.",
      "Mark Greenblatt, a former inspector general for the Interior Department and a former CIGIE chair, posted a statement Tuesday warning about the impact of the cuts.",
      "\"Without this infrastructure, I fear the individual inspectors general will be isolated, their effectiveness diminished, and their ability to protect taxpayer interests severely compromised,\" Greenblatt said.",
      "CIGIE also helps review possible misconduct by federal inspectors general themselves, in a \"policing the police\" type of mission. Greenblatt alleges the organization is being defunded because of its prior review of a federal inspector appointed during the first Trump term.",
      "Mike Ware, the former inspector general for the Small Business Administration, says the council's defunding could cripple the ability of federal watchdogs to monitor the administration's actions. Ware said nearly 30 inspectors general offices depend on CIGIE to host their websites, which he says are \"essential for transparency and public accountability.\"",
      "\"It would also dismantle critical cross-agency collaboration by eliminating shared data analytics platforms that help expose waste, fraud and abuse,\" Ware said. \"Just as concerning, it would strip away the training and professional development infrastructure that sustains the 14,000 oversight professionals dedicated to safeguarding taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "The move has raised rare, bipartisan criticism. GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration's decision, writing in a letter this week, \"Absent immediate action, (CIGIE) will need to furlough staff and terminate important functions that help prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the government.\"",
      "In their letter, Grassley and Collins said, \"We urgently request an explanation for these actions and ask that you to promptly reverse course,\" in order to allow CIGIE to continue its \"important oversight work uninterrupted.\"",
      "The two Republican senators, in an unusual rebuke of a decision inside their own party, have asked the Trump administration to hand over records and answers about the cuts by Friday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Tuesday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian students for deportation in order to strike fear into international students and curb lawful speech.",
      "In a 161-page decision, U.S. District Judge William Young delivered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to pursue international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses, which he said was constitutionally protected speech.",
      "The judge, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, was unsparing not only in his views of Noem and Rubio's actions, but also of President Trump, who he said approves of \"truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech\" on the part of two senior administration officials.",
      "\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he wrote.",
      "Of Noem and Rubio, as well as other administration officials, Young wrote that they \"acted in concert to misuse the sweeping powers of their respective offices to target noncitizen pro-Palestinians for deportation primarily on account of their First Amendment protected political speech,\" and did so through targeted deportation proceedings aimed at pro-Palestinian student activists across the country, which \"continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.\"",
      "In response to Young's decision, Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said, \"The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk.\"",
      "The judge issued his decision after holding a nine-day trial that examined whether the administration had violated the free speech rights of academic associations that sued the Trump administration for arrests, detentions and deportations of foreign students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Young praised the witnesses who testified on behalf of the government, saying of them that they were \"decent, credible, dedicated nonpartisan professionals. True patriots who, in order to do their duty, have been weaponized by their highest superiors to reach foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends.\"",
      "But he accused Rubio and Noem of acting with \"invidious\" intent: \"to target a few for speaking out and then use the full rigor of the Immigration and Nationality Act (in ways it had never been used before) to have them publicly deported with the goal of tamping down pro-Palestinian student protests and terrorizing similarly situated non-citizen (and other) pro-Palestinians into silence because their views were unwelcome.\"",
      "Young further chastised the Trump administration for deploying masked agents to detain students like Tufts University doctoral student and Turkish native Rumeysa Ozturk, who was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities in March and spent more than a month and a half in federal immigration custody before lawyers secured her release from detention.",
      "\"This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's captors for masking-up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE. It rejects this testimony as disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable. ICE goes masked for a single reason \u2014 to terrorize Americans into quiescence,\" Young wrote. \"To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.\"",
      "In response to Young's criticism of federal immigration agents wearing masks, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked the judge, calling him \"craven,\" and said officers wear masks to protect themselves.",
      "\"Our ICE law enforcement should be thanked for risking their lives every day to arrest dangerous criminals,\" she said in a statement. \"It's stunning that even after the terrorist attack and recent arrests of rioters with guns outside of ICE facilities, this Judge decides to stoke the embers of hatred.\"",
      "The judge on Tuesday also responded to a threat sent to his chambers, putting the anonymous threat, and his response, at the top of the opinion \u2014 an unusual, rare move.",
      "\"Trump has pardons and tanks \u2026 what do you have?\" says the post card, dated June 19 and written by hand. Young responds that \"Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States \u2014 you and me \u2014 have our magnificent Constitution,\" he writes, before delivering his opinion in the case. At the end of his opinion, Young again wrote to the person who sent the anonymous threat.",
      "\"I hope you found this helpful. Thanks for writing. It shows you care. You should,\" Young wrote.",
      "The judge then invited the anonymous sender to visit the court to watch a proceeding.",
      "While Young concluded that Noem and Rubio unconstitutionally chilled the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian students by targeting them for deportation, he ended his decision with a searing rebuke of Mr. Trump and the changes to the executive branch he has ushered in since returning to the White House in January.",
      "Noem has not yet responded to a request for comment, and Rubio has also not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "Young accused the president of \"hollow bragging\" and said he \"ignores everything\" from the Constitution to civil laws to regulations, only to continue \"bullying on.\"",
      "Given that Mr. Trump is immune from prosecution, the judge said the president is prepared to deploy \"all the resources of the nation against obstruction.\"",
      "\"Behold President Trump's successes in limiting free speech \u2014 law firms cower, institutional leaders in higher education meekly appease the President, media outlets from huge conglomerates to small niche magazines mind the bottom line rather than the ethics of journalism,\" Young wrote.",
      "In July, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, settled a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million.",
      "The judge said Mr. Trump \"meets dissent from his orders in those other two branches by demonizing and disparaging the speakers, sometimes descending to personal vitriol,\" calling those he dislikes \"traitors.\"",
      "But Young praises the judiciary for rebuffing the Trump administration in its efforts to infringe on the First Amendment rights of those he dislikes, from law firms who challenged executive orders targeting them, to universities like Harvard that have been punished by the administration to news outlets like the Associated Press.",
      "\"I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,\" Young writes in closing. \"Is he correct?\"",
      "Young was appointed by Reagan to the federal bench in 1985 and called the case involving the administration's efforts to punish pro-Palestinian activists \"perhaps the most important\" to fall within the jurisdiction of the district court in Massachusetts.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:10:37 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 14:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced most favored nation cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Bourla called it an \"historic day\" because Pfizer would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House have released specific drug prices yet.",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "story": [
      "Federal immigration officials have revealed plans to reopen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to new applicants to comply with a court order, though they cautioned the Trump administration retains the discretion to modify the Obama-era policy.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has made plans to accept and process new DACA applications from immigrants not enrolled in the initiative, which currently allows more than half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation, the Justice Department said in a court filing Monday.",
      "Dreamers are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas. The Obama administration created DACA in 2012 to protect this population from deportation amid congressional gridlock on immigration reform. Due to litigation, DACA has been closed to new applicants since 2021, though existing beneficiaries have been able to renew their two-year work permits.",
      "To qualify for DACA, applicants must show they arrived in the U.S. by age 16 and before June 2007; that they enrolled in an American high school or enlisted in the military; and lack any serious criminal record.",
      "The announcement that DACA could be reopened pending a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen was outlined in a Justice Department court filing in the years-long legal battle over the policy.",
      "The government's plan is designed to comply with an order from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in January that upheld Hanen's finding that the DACA program is unlawful.",
      "While the 5th Circuit found that a Biden administration regulation to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law, the appeals court narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The appellate court also paused its ruling as it relates to existing DACA beneficiaries.",
      "To comply with that order, the Trump administration said it intends to process initial DACA requests once Hanen issues an order dictating the next steps in the case.",
      "The administration said applicants in all states outside of Texas who are approved will be eligible for DACA's deportation protections and work permits. Those residing in Texas will only be eligible for the program's deportation deferrals \u2014 not work authorization. Texas residents approved for DACA will also not be considered to be lawfully present in the U.S., unlike existing recipients. Those who move to Texas could have their work permits revoked.",
      "Texas has been able to convince federal courts that it has been harmed by the federal government's efforts to grant work permits and other benefits to unauthorized immigrants through DACA.",
      "As of the end of June, there were more than 525,000 people enrolled in DACA, with nearly 88,000 of them living in Texas, home to the second-largest Dreamer population in the country, according to federal data.",
      "The Trump administration reiterated in its court filing Monday that these plans do not prevent the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, \"from undertaking any future lawful changes to DACA.\"",
      "While President Trump tried to terminate DACA during his first term \u2014 a move the Supreme Court blocked in 2020 on technical grounds \u2014 he has not articulated a firm plan for the program's future during his second administration.",
      "As the second Trump administration has dramatically expanded efforts across the country to arrest and deport people living in the U.S. unlawfully, some DACA recipients have been caught in the dragnet, including after traffic stops. While a grant of DACA offers a temporary reprieve from deportation, officials have wide-ranging discretion to revoke it.",
      "In their own filing Monday, the Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality asked Hanen to order the Trump administration to start a wind-down of the program, including for existing recipients. They argued Congress should decide the fate of DACA recipients.",
      "\"Sympathy for DACA recipients, understandable though it may be, is no substitute for statutory text or constitutional command,\" the GOP-led states wrote in their filing. \"Like all who reside within our borders, they must abide by the rule of law.\"",

      "A group of Democratic senators is asking the Justice Department to help prevent convicted U.S. Capitol rioters from being reimbursed by taxpayers for court-ordered fines.",
      "Federal judges ordered hundreds of rioters to pay restitution to offset the estimated $3 million in damages and cleanup costs from the 2021 attack. Only 15% of the costs had been reimbursed by Jan. 6 defendants as of summer 2024, according to a review by CBS News. But hours after returning to office, President Trump pardoned everybody convicted as part of the riot.",
      "In a letter dated Monday and obtained by CBS News, the top Democrats on the Senate Rules and Senate Judiciary committees asked the Justice Department to oppose efforts to seek repayments by those convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, riots.",
      "\"These criminals are apparently demanding taxpayer compensation, not only to refund court-ordered restitution to cover damages they caused to the Capitol Building, but also to compensate them for having to face legal consequences for their actions,\" the letter reads.",
      "A CBS News review of court filings by some of the more than 1,500 pardoned Capitol riot defendants shows a growing number of formal requests to have federal courts order reimbursements.",
      "In a request submitted to a D.C. federal judge on Monday, riot defendant Richard Barnett cited Mr. Trump's pardon and Barnett's appeal of his conviction as part of a justification for the reimbursement of $2,455 in restitution and court assessment payments. Barnett's argument, in part, cited prior cases of pardon defendants.",
      "It said the Justice Department's decision in February to vacate his case \"wipes the slate clean, and restores to the defendant both the presumption of innocence and the right to be paid money based on a now vacated conviction.\"",
      "Barnett was found guilty by a Washington, D.C., grand jury in 2023, after prosecutors successfully argued he was on the front lines of the mob and was photographed with his feet on a desk in the office of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge John Bates ordered the reimbursement of restitution payments to Jan. 6 defendant Yvonne St. Cyr, who was found guilty of obstructing law enforcement and other offenses as part of the Capitol riot.",
      "Bates directed the U.S. Treasury to pay the defendant back $2,270. The judge noted that St. Cyr was in the process of appealing her case when Mr. Trump returned to office, and an appellate court moved to vacate her conviction because she received a pardon from the president, so in \"the eyes of the law, no conviction ever existed.\"",
      "Bates' 15-page order opened, \"Sometimes a judge is called upon to do what the law requires, even if it may seem at odds with what justice or one's initial instincts might warrant. This is one such occasion.\"",
      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, the Justice Department supported St. Cyr's request for repayment. A filing submitted by U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro in August said the conviction \"was 'invalidated' when the D.C. Circuit vacated it.\"",
      "But in a separate case, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss denied a refund request by convicted Capitol riot participant Hector Vargas Santos. The Justice Department had supported his request.",
      "The Democratic senators' letter to the Justice Department, led by Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who is the vice chair of the Senate Rules Committee, said the efforts for repayments are part of a broader effort to rewrite the history of the Capitol insurrection. The letter called it \"an attempt to rewrite history and paint themselves as sympathetic victims.\"",
      "\"Misusing taxpayer funds to financially reward those insurrectionists because they were prosecuted and convicted for their violent and destructive acts is unthinkable,\" the letter reads.",

      "A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed enforcement.",
      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S. and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state's attorney general are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \"the trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\" and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: that allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced into taking them.",
      "\"Rosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office didn't immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",
      "Email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "The combination of a Louisiana criminal case and a Texas civil case over abortion pills is also playing out surrounding a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter. New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her.",
      "In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor's mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",
      "New York officials cite a law there that seeks to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion medications to patients in states with abortion bans \u2014 or where such prescriptions by telehealth violate the law.",
      "New York and California are among the eight states that have shield laws with such provisions, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "The Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine said they \"fully expect\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, to uphold his state's shield law in the new case.",
      "Murrill told The Associated Press she will sue governors whose shield laws \"purport to protect these individuals from criminal conduct\" in Louisiana.",
      "The legal filings that revealed the Louisiana charge against Coeytaux are part of an effort for Louisiana, along with Florida and Texas, to join a lawsuit filed last year by the Republican attorneys general for Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "This year, both Louisiana and Texas have adopted laws to target out-of-state providers of abortion pills.",
      "The Louisiana law lets patients who receive abortions sue providers and others. The Texas law goes further and allows anyone to sue those who prescribe such pills in the state.",
      "Both Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary have said they are conducting a full review of mifepristone's safety and effectiveness.",
      "Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges. But she said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult by limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail or by restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently permitted to prescribe it.",
      "Medication abortion has been available in the U.S. since 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of mifepristone.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a memo on Monday directing agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other Justice Department agencies to assist in guarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.",
      "The move by Bondi \u2014 which she hinted at on Friday \u2014 came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an ICE facility or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of \"extreme political violence.\"",
      "In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should \"immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack.\" She also announced the formation of a temporary \"ICE Protection Task Force\" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.",
      "She singled out Portland and Chicago for operations to protect ICE facilities, and said she's directing federal prosecutors in both cities to seek charges against anybody accused of threatening or assaulting law enforcement. President Trump is also looking to deploy\u00a0hundreds of troops\u00a0to the two cities, drawing vehement opposition from local officials.",
      "ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.",
      "On Friday, Bondi also floated a broader crackdown on \"repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.\" She directed the Joint Terrorism Task Forces \u2014 which are regional entities scattered throughout the country that\u00a0work with\u00a0the FBI and with state and local police \u2014 to look into what she described as \"domestic terrorism.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice will seek the most serious available charges against all participants in these criminal mobs, including conspiracy offenses, assault offenses, civil disorder offenses, and terrorism offenses,\" the attorney general wrote Friday.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump signed a memo calling for investigations into \"political violence and intimidation,\" led by the Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The White House pointed to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, last year's assassination attempts against Mr. Trump, and an increase in attacks on ICE officers.",
      "The president also penned an executive order labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The move's legal implications aren't clear. Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist,\" generally refers to a loose collection of largely left-wing activists, not a cohesive organization with a leadership structure. Also, domestic terrorism isn't a chargeable offense under federal law, and the government doesn't have a formal list of domestic terrorist groups, unlike with foreign groups.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate returns to Washington on Monday with less than two days to fund the government amid a stalemate between Democrats and Republicans on the path forward that has increased the likelihood of a government shutdown this week.",
      "Lawmakers were away on recess last week after the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But the measure fell short in the Senate, as Democrats pushed a counter-proposal that would keep the government funded through October, while attaching a handful of their priorities. That measure also failed to secure the necessary support for passage.",
      "Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, a majority. But with 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber, Republicans can't approve a bill to fund the government without the help of Democrats.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats have been pushing to extract a more favorable outcome in the spending fight, facing pressure from their base to push back on the Trump administration's policies. But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "Democratic leaders have been pushing for a meeting with Mr. Trump on government funding. And the leaders are set to meet Monday with the president, alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Then, the Trump administration upped the ante last week, when the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he called Thune Friday and urged him to get the leaders together for a meeting. The next day, he said the White House told them the meeting was on for Monday afternoon.",

      "The shutdown blame game",
      "Democrats and Republicans have preempted the possible shutdown in recent days, seeking to put the blame on the other party should Congress fail to fund the government \u2014 forcing federal agencies to halt non-essential functions.",
      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",

    "summary": "The findings have the potential to resolve the longstanding \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",

    "story": [
      "Marine life is thriving on unexploded Nazi bombs sitting at the bottom of a German bay, a submersible has discovered, even capturing footage of starfishes creeping across a huge chunk of TNT.",
      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material \u2014 except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",
      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",
      "Hard surfaces on the seafloor are important for marine life that want more than mud and sand.",
      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",
      "The scientists also plan to return to the spot next month to set up a time-lapse camera to watch what the starfishes do next.",
      "Marine life also thriving in shipwrecks",
      "It's the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.",
      "Studies like these are a testament to how nature takes advantage of human leftovers, flipping the script to survive, said marine conservation biologist David Johnston with Duke University. He recently mapped sunken World War I ships that have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.",
      "\"I think it's a really cool testimony to the strength of life,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.",
      "A 2023 paper\u00a0published in BioScience\u00a0found that shipwrecks provide important ecological resources for a wide variety of organisms, from tiny microbes to large marine creatures.",

The region is just a few hundred light-years from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and is densely packed with stars, star-forming clouds and complex magnetic fields. Sagittarius B holds only 10% of the galactic center's gas, but produces 50% of its stars.",

The astronomers will continue to study these stars to learn more about their size and age, which will inform research into the process of star formation in Sagittarius B2.",

    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "Working with IBM, the bank used a combination of classical computing and the tech giant's Heron quantum processor to deliver a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions, HSBC said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0shared Tuesday.",
      "Philip Intallura, HSBC's group head of quantum technologies, called the trial a \"ground-breaking world-first.\" He expanded on the technology in a company video included in the announcement, saying the improvement in trade predictions ultimately means \"increased margins and greater liquidity.\"",
      "The trial was intended to test how quantum computers could optimize requests in over-the-counter markets, where financial assets are traded without a centralized exchange or broker serving as the intermediary. Using IBM's latest generation of quantum computers, the companies were able to estimate how likely a trade was to be a filled at a quoted price with far more accuracy than standard methods of using classical computers alone, according to the announcement.",
      "\"This is something that we do thousands of times a day already and that's estimating the likelihood of winning a trade,\" Josh Freeland, global head of algo credit trading at HSBC, said in the same video.",
      "Marco Pistoia, senior vice president of industry relations at IonQ, an American quantum computing hardware and software company, said the speed and accuracy of quantum computing allows traders to react to the fast-changing market more quickly.",
      "\"This is essential for financial institutions, for which time is of the essence,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technology has long been intertwined in Wall Street trading. Automation systems used to assist traders were installed at the New York Stock Exchange in the\u00a01950s. Two decades later came the first rumblings of algorithmic trading \u2014 using computers programs to automatically execute trades. About two thirds of all trades were conducted using computers by 2009, Deutsche Bank research\u00a0shows.",

      "\"IBM Heron was able to augment classical computing workflows to better unravel hidden pricing signals in noisy market data than standard, classical-only approaches in use by HSBC, resulting in strong improvements in the bond trading process,\" HSBC said in its announcement.",
      "According to HSBC, the trial represents the first empirical evidence that quantum computers can be used to solve practical problems in the field of algorithmic bond trading.",
      "\"We have great confidence we are on the cusp of a new frontier of computing in financial services, rather than something that is far away in the future,\" Intallura said HSBC's statement.",

      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",

      "Aurora, a young woman who was committed to Peninsula as a teenager, said the hospital sits so close to the river that it felt like a moat keeping her and dozens of other patients inside. KFF Health News agreed not to publish her full name because she shared private medical history.",

      "Covenant Health, which runs Peninsula Hospital, said in a statement it has a \"proactive and thorough approach to emergency planning\" but declined to provide details or answer questions.",
      "Peninsula is one of about 170 American hospitals, totaling nearly 30,000 patient beds from coast to coast, that face the greatest risk of significant or dangerous flooding, according to a months-long KFF Health News investigation based on data provided by Fathom, a company considered a leader in flood simulation. At many of these hospitals, flooding from heavy storms has the potential to jeopardize patient care, block access to emergency rooms, and force evacuations. Sometimes there is no other hospital nearby.",
      "Much of this risk to hospitals is not captured by flood maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have served as the nation's de facto tool for flood estimation for half a century, despite being incomplete and sometimes decades out of date. As FEMA's maps have become divorced from the reality of a changing climate, private companies like Fathom have filled the gap with simulations of future floods. But many of their predictions are behind a paywall, leaving the public mostly reliant on free, significantly limited government maps.",
      "\"This is highly concerning,\" said Caleb Dresser, who studies climate change and is both an emergency room doctor and a Harvard University assistant professor. \"If you don't have the information to know you're at risk, then how can you triage that problem?\"",
      "The deadliest hospital flooding in modern American history occurred 20 years ago during Hurricane Katrina, when the bodies of 45 people were recovered from New Orleans' Memorial Medical Center, including some patients whom investigators suspected were euthanized. More flooding deaths were narrowly avoided one year ago when helicopters rescued\u00a0dozens of people as Hurricane Helene engulfed Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee.",

      "\"I was scared to death, thinking, 'This is it,'\" Harrison told CBS News, which interviewed Unicoi survivors as part of KFF Health News' investigation. \"Alarms were going off. People were screaming. It was chaos.\"",
      "The investigation \u2014 among the first to analyze nationwide hospital flood risk in an era of warming climate and worsening storms \u2014 comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has slashed federal agencies that\u00a0forecast and\u00a0respond\u00a0to extreme weather and also dismantled FEMA programs designed to protect hospitals and other important buildings from floods.",
      "When asked to comment, FEMA said flooding is a common, costly, and \"under appreciated\" disaster but made no statement specific to hospitals. Spokesperson Daniel Llargu\u00e9s defended the administration's changes to FEMA by reissuing an August statement that dismissed criticism as coming from \"bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency.\"",
      "Alice Hill, an Obama administration climate risk expert, said the Trump administration's dismissal of climate change and worsening floods would waste billions of dollars and endanger lives.",
      "In 2015, Hill led the creation of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, which required that hospitals and other essential structures be elevated or incorporate extra flood protections to qualify for federal funding.",
      "FEMA\u00a0stopped enforcing the standard in March.",
      "\"People will die as a result of some of the choices being made today,\" Hill said. \"We will be less prepared than we are now. And we already were, in my estimation, poorly prepared.\"",
      "\"Flood risk is everywhere\"",
      "The KFF Health News investigation identified more than 170 hospitals facing a flood risk by comparing the locations of more than 7,000 facilities to peer-reviewed flood hazard mapping provided by Fathom, a United Kingdom company that simulates flooding in spaces as small as 10 meters using laser-precision elevation measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Hospitals were determined to have a significant risk if Fathom's 100-year flood data predicted that a foot or more of water could reach a considerable portion of their buildings, excluding parking garages, or cut off road access to the hospital. A 100-year flood is an intense weather event that has roughly a 1% chance of occurring in any given year but can happen more often.",
      "The investigation found heightened flood risks at large trauma centers, small rural hospitals, children's hospitals, and long-term care facilities that serve older and disabled patients. At least 21 are critical access hospitals, with the next-closest hospital 25 miles away, on average.",
      "Flooding threatens dozens of hospitals in coastal areas, including in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and New York. Farther inland, flooding of rivers or creeks could envelop other hospitals, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. Even in the sun-soaked cities and arid expanses of the American West, storms have the potential to surround some hospitals with several feet of pooling water, according to Fathom's data.",
      "These findings are likely an undercount of hospitals at risk because the investigation overlooked pockets of potential flooding at some hospitals. It excluded facilities like stand-alone ERs, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes.",
      "\"The reality is that flood risk is everywhere. It is the most pervasive of perils,\" said Oliver Wing, the chief scientific officer at Fathom, who reviewed the findings. \"Just because you haven't experienced an extreme doesn't mean you never will.\"",
      "Dresser, the ER doctor, said even a small amount of flooding can shut down an unprepared hospital, often by interrupting its power supply, which is needed for life-sustaining equipment like ventilators and heart monitors. He said the most vulnerable hospitals would likely be in rural areas.",
      "\"A lot of rural hospitals are now closing their pediatric units, closing their psychiatry units,\" Dresser said. \"In a financially stressed situation, it can be hard to prioritize long-term threats, even if they are, for some institutions, potentially existential.\"",
      "Urban hospitals can face dangerous flooding, too. Fathom's data predicts 5 to 15 feet of water around neighboring hospitals \u2014 Kadlec Regional Medical Center and Lourdes Behavioral Health \u2014 that straddle a tiny creek in Richland, Washington.",
      "By Fathom's estimate, a 100-year flood could cause the nearby Columbia River to spill over a levee that protects Richland, then loosely follow the creek to the hospitals. Some of the deepest flooding is estimated around Lourdes, which was built on land the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set aside in 1961 as a \"ponding and drainage easement.\"",
      "At the time, this land was supposed to be capable of storing enough water to fill at least 40 Olympic-size swimming pools, according to military documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. A mental health facility has occupied this spot since the 1970s.",
      "Both Kadlec and Lourdes said in statements that they have disaster plans but did not answer questions about flooding. Tina Baumgardner, a Lourdes spokesperson, said government flood maps show the hospital is not in a 100-year flood plain.",
      "This is not uncommon. Of the more than 170 hospitals with significant flood risk identified by KFF Health News, one-third are located in areas that FEMA has not designated as flood hazard zones.",
      "Sometimes the difference is stark. For example, at Ochsner Choctaw General in Alabama \u2014 the only hospital for 30 miles in any direction \u2014 FEMA maps suggest a 100-year flood would overflow a nearby creek but spare the hospital. Fathom's data predicts the same event would flood most of the hospital with 1 to 2 feet of water, including the ER and the helicopter pad.",
      "Loading...",
      "Ochsner Health did not answer questions about flooding preparations at Choctaw General.",
      "FEMA flood maps were launched in the '60s as part of the National Flood Insurance Program to determine where insurance is required and building codes should include flood-proofing. According to a FEMA statement, the maps show only a \"snapshot in time\" and are not intended to predict where flooding will or won't happen.",
      "FEMA spokesperson Geoff Harbaugh said the agency intends to modernize its maps through the Future of Flood Risk Data initiative, which will enable the agency to \"better project flood risk\" and give Americans \"the information they need to protect their lives and property.\"",

      "Fathom, however, said its flood simulation accounts for the dams and stressed that a large enough storm could drop more rain than even the TVA could control. These predictions are echoed by another flood modeling firm, First Street, which also says an intense storm could cause more than 10 feet of flooding in the area around Peninsula.",
      "\"It's a hospital right on the banks of a major American river,\" said Wing, the Fathom scientist. \"It just isn't conceivable that such a location is risk-free.\"",

      "Swollen by Helene, the nearby Nolichucky River spilled over its banks and around\u00a0 the hospital, which was built in a flood plain. Staff tried to bar the doors, Mitchell said, but the water got\u00a0 in, trapping her and others inside. The lights went out. People fled to the roof, where the roar of rushing water nearly drowned out the approach of rescue helicopters, Mitchell said.",
      "Ultimately, 70 people, including Mitchell and her mother, were airlifted to safety on Sept. 27, 2024, narrowly escaping the hospital without a single death. The hospital remains closed, and the company that owns it, Ballad Health, has said its reopening is uncertain.",
      "\"Why allow something \u2014 especially a hospital \u2014 to be built in an area like that?\" Mitchell told CBS News. \"People have to rely on these areas to get medical help, and they're dangerous.\"",
      "Beyond Unicoi, KFF Health News identified 39 inland hospitals \u2014 including 16 in Appalachia \u2014 that Fathom predicts could flood when nearby rivers, creeks, or drainage canals overspill their banks, even in storms far less intense than Helene.",

      "After Hurricane Helene made landfall a year ago, a raging river flooded a rural hospital in eastern Tennessee. Patients and employees were rescued from the rooftop. Floods have hit hospitals from New York to Nebraska to Texas in recent years. We wanted to determine how many other U.S. hospitals face similar peril. Ultimately, we found more than 170 hospitals at risk.",
      "For this analysis, we used data from Fathom, a United Kingdom-based company that specializes in flood-risk modeling across the globe. To assess the United States' vulnerability, Fathom uses sophisticated computer simulations and detailed terrain data covering the country. It accounts for environmental factors such as climate change, soil conditions, and many rivers and creeks not mapped by other sources. Fathom's modeling has been peer-reviewed and used by insurance companies, the World Bank, the Nature Conservancy, and government agencies in Florida, Texas, and elsewhere. The Iowa Flood Center has validated Fathom's U.S. data.",
      "Through a data use agreement, Fathom shared its U.S. mapping data that predicts areas with at least a 1% chance of flooding in any given year. Fathom's data estimates the effects of three main types of flooding: coastal, fluvial (from overflowing rivers, lakes, or streams), and pluvial (rainfall that the ground can't absorb). The data also accounts for dams, reservoirs, and other structures that defend against floods.",
      "To identify at-risk hospitals, we used a publicly available Department of Homeland Security database containing the GPS coordinates of more than 7,000 short-term acute, critical access, rehab, and psychiatric hospitals \u2014 basically any hospital with inpatient services. (DHS under the Trump administration has discontinued public access to the database, so data for hospitals and other infrastructure is no longer widely available.)",
      "Using GPS coordinates as the centerpoint, we created a circle with a 150-yard radius around each hospital, which in most cases captured the building plus nearby grounds and access roads. We then mapped Fathom's flood-risk data to see where it overlapped with these circles. We started by looking for hospitals where at least 20% of the circle's area had a predicted flood depth of at least 1 foot. That gave us an initial list of more than 320 hospitals across the U.S.",
      "From there, we visually inspected those hospitals using mapping software and Google Maps, both satellite and street view. We trimmed our list to only the hospitals where a considerable portion of the building or all access roads were predicted to have at least a foot of flooding.",
      "If two hospitals were mapped to the same building \u2014 for instance, a small rehab facility within a large hospital \u2014 we counted only one hospital. We also excluded hospitals recently converted to nursing homes or for other uses.",
      "We ended up with a list of 171 hospitals across the U.S. That is most likely an undercount. Some hospitals could still face significant impact from flooding that is not deep enough or widespread enough to fit our methodology. Our analysis also does not account for how flooding farther from a hospital could affect employees or patients. And it does not assess what steps hospitals may have already taken to prepare for severe weather events.",
      "We also ran a spatial analysis comparing Fathom's data with flood hazard maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which in many cases are incomplete or haven't been updated in years. We found that about a third of hospitals identified as flood risks by Fathom's data did not overlap at all with FEMA's 100- or 500-year hazard areas.",
      "Fathom provided guidance and feedback as we developed our analysis.",

      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",

      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took affect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown.

Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",

      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",

      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government\u00a0shutdown\u00a0went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hourse left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "Washington \u2014 The federal government began shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority expired, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department will begin shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown. On Tuesday, both proposals to extend government funding again fell short in the Senate.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "With the government shutting down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown lasts remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

      "CNN was first to report the nomination had been withdrawn.",
      "Antoni was nominated for the role by Mr. Trump in August, after the president fired former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer earlier in the month following a weaker-than-expected jobs report, which he blamed her for.",
      "Mr. Trump at the time described the report, which showed employers added 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 which fell below predictions, as \"a shock,\" and said a sizeable revision showing 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously reported was a \"major mistake.\"",

    "summary": "The homes, once propped on high stilts, collapsed in the afternoon in Buxton, a community on one of a string of islands that make up the Outer Banks.",
    "story": [
      "Five unoccupied houses along North Carolina's Outer Banks collapsed into the ocean on Tuesday as Hurricanes Humberto and Imelda rumbled in the Atlantic, the National Park Service said, marking the latest private beachfront structures to fall into the surf there in recent years.",
      "The homes, once propped on high stilts, collapsed in the afternoon in Buxton, a community on one of a string of islands that make up the Outer Banks, said Mike Barber, a spokesperson for the park service.",
      "No injuries were reported, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore said in a post on social media.",
      "In a video taken by Brayan Garcia, homes teetered on stilts battered by the waves before plunging into the surf. The shoreline was clogged with debris, two-by-fours, cushions and an entire home as wave after wave rolled in from the Atlantic.",
      "\"Seashore visitors are urged to stay away from the collapsed house sites and to use caution for miles to the south of the sites, due to the presence of potentially hazardous debris,\" Cape Hatteras National Seashore's post said.",
      "The post also said more collapses were possible given the ocean conditions.",
      "It's the second time in six weeks that the Outer Banks faced strong waves churned by a hurricane. In late August,\u00a0Hurricane Erin\u00a0brought rough surfs and high tides to Rodanthe, North Carolina, where beachfront homes appeared to be on the verge of collapse.",
      "North Carolina's coast is almost entirely made up of narrow, low-lying barrier islands that have been eroding amid sea level rise for years. Seventeen privately owned houses have collapsed on Seashore beaches since 2020, the park service said.",
      "The first 15 were located north of Buxton in Rodanthe, but a Buxton home fell into the surf two weeks ago.",
      "The threat to these structures often builds when storms affect the region, as is the case with the two latest storms, even as they headed further out in the Atlantic. Barrier islands like the Outer Banks were never an ideal place for development, according to experts. The islands\u00a0typically form\u00a0as waves deposit sediment off the mainland, and they move based on weather patterns and other ocean forces, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service.\u00a0Some even disappear.",
      "Portions of eastern North Carolina were subject to coastal flood advisories and warnings, the National Weather Service said, while dangerous surf conditions were expected in the area through the rest of the week.",
      "Ocean overwash on Tuesday also prompted the state Transportation Department to close a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 on Ocracoke Island. The ferry connecting Ocracoke and Hatteras islands was also suspended on Tuesday, the department said.",
      "Swells generated by Hurricanes Imelda and Humberto are expected to affect parts of the U.S. East Coast for the next few days.",
      "Imelda is the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on the heels of Hurricane Humberto, which rapidly intensified to a major hurricane over the Atlantic on Saturday, but it is not expected to reach land. Imelda is forecast to drift farther east through the week.",

    "summary": "Two GOP senators are raising questions about the defunding of the Council of Inspectors General.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is pulling a federal watchdog off the beat in Washington, effective Wednesday, stripping funding from the Council of Inspectors General.",
      "Removing the council's funding will mean a further hollowing out of the work of federal inspectors general and internal government investigators who are supposed to root out waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct in the administration.",
      "The council, which is an independent entity within the executive branch, is tasked with addressing \"integrity, economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual Government agencies,\" according to the council's\u00a0website.",
      "The Trump administration argues the inspectors general are \"corrupt.\"",
      "\"Inspectors general are meant to be impartial watchdogs identifying waste and corruption on behalf of the American people,\" a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget told CBS News in a statement. \"Unfortunately, they have become corrupt, partisan, and in some cases, have lied to the public. The American people will no longer be funding this corruption.\"",
      "The council, often referred to as CIGIE, helps train, equip and provide investigative expertise to the dozens of federal inspectors general. Its staff helps operate hotlines for tips, hosts websites for the inspectors and provides data analysis and investigative tools to help with probes. CIGIE helps support nearly 14,000 federal investigative employees, according to a former CIGIE official.",
      "Mark Greenblatt, a former inspector general for the Interior Department and a former CIGIE chair, posted a statement Tuesday warning about the impact of the cuts.",
      "\"Without this infrastructure, I fear the individual inspectors general will be isolated, their effectiveness diminished, and their ability to protect taxpayer interests severely compromised,\" Greenblatt said.",
      "CIGIE also helps review possible misconduct by federal inspectors general themselves, in a \"policing the police\" type of mission. Greenblatt alleges the organization is being defunded because of its prior review of a federal inspector appointed during the first Trump term.",
      "Mike Ware, the former inspector general for the Small Business Administration, says the council's defunding could cripple the ability of federal watchdogs to monitor the administration's actions. Ware said nearly 30 inspectors general offices depend on CIGIE to host their websites, which he says are \"essential for transparency and public accountability.\"",
      "\"It would also dismantle critical cross-agency collaboration by eliminating shared data analytics platforms that help expose waste, fraud and abuse,\" Ware said. \"Just as concerning, it would strip away the training and professional development infrastructure that sustains the 14,000 oversight professionals dedicated to safeguarding taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "The move has raised rare, bipartisan criticism. GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration's decision, writing in a letter this week, \"Absent immediate action, (CIGIE) will need to furlough staff and terminate important functions that help prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the government.\"",
      "In their letter, Grassley and Collins said, \"We urgently request an explanation for these actions and ask that you to promptly reverse course,\" in order to allow CIGIE to continue its \"important oversight work uninterrupted.\"",
      "The two Republican senators, in an unusual rebuke of a decision inside their own party, have asked the Trump administration to hand over records and answers about the cuts by Friday.",

    "summary": "A judge gave a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to go after international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Tuesday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian students for deportation in order to strike fear into international students and curb lawful speech.",
      "In a 161-page decision, U.S. District Judge William Young delivered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's efforts to pursue international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views on college campuses, which he said was constitutionally protected speech.",
      "The judge, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, was unsparing not only in his views of Noem and Rubio's actions, but also of President Trump, who he said approves of \"truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech\" on the part of two senior administration officials.",
      "\"The president's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech,\" he wrote.",
      "Of Noem and Rubio, as well as other administration officials, Young wrote that they \"acted in concert to misuse the sweeping powers of their respective offices to target noncitizen pro-Palestinians for deportation primarily on account of their First Amendment protected political speech,\" and did so through targeted deportation proceedings aimed at pro-Palestinian student activists across the country, which \"continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.\"",
      "In response to Young's decision, Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said, \"The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk.\"",
      "The judge issued his decision after holding a nine-day trial that examined whether the administration had violated the free speech rights of academic associations that sued the Trump administration for arrests, detentions and deportations of foreign students and faculty who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Young praised the witnesses who testified on behalf of the government, saying of them that they were \"decent, credible, dedicated nonpartisan professionals. True patriots who, in order to do their duty, have been weaponized by their highest superiors to reach foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends.\"",
      "But he accused Rubio and Noem of acting with \"invidious\" intent: \"to target a few for speaking out and then use the full rigor of the Immigration and Nationality Act (in ways it had never been used before) to have them publicly deported with the goal of tamping down pro-Palestinian student protests and terrorizing similarly situated non-citizen (and other) pro-Palestinians into silence because their views were unwelcome.\"",
      "Young further chastised the Trump administration for deploying masked agents to detain students like Tufts University doctoral student and Turkish native Rumeysa Ozturk, who was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities in March and spent more than a month and a half in federal immigration custody before lawyers secured her release from detention.",
      "\"This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's captors for masking-up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE. It rejects this testimony as disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable. ICE goes masked for a single reason \u2014 to terrorize Americans into quiescence,\" Young wrote. \"To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.\"",
      "In response to Young's criticism of federal immigration agents wearing masks, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked the judge, calling him \"craven,\" and said officers wear masks to protect themselves.",
      "\"Our ICE law enforcement should be thanked for risking their lives every day to arrest dangerous criminals,\" she said in a statement. \"It's stunning that even after the terrorist attack and recent arrests of rioters with guns outside of ICE facilities, this Judge decides to stoke the embers of hatred.\"",
      "The judge on Tuesday also responded to a threat sent to his chambers, putting the anonymous threat, and his response, at the top of the opinion \u2014 an unusual, rare move.",
      "\"Trump has pardons and tanks \u2026 what do you have?\" says the post card, dated June 19 and written by hand. Young responds that \"Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States \u2014 you and me \u2014 have our magnificent Constitution,\" he writes, before delivering his opinion in the case. At the end of his opinion, Young again wrote to the person who sent the anonymous threat.",
      "\"I hope you found this helpful. Thanks for writing. It shows you care. You should,\" Young wrote.",
      "The judge then invited the anonymous sender to visit the court to watch a proceeding.",
      "While Young concluded that Noem and Rubio unconstitutionally chilled the free speech rights of pro-Palestinian students by targeting them for deportation, he ended his decision with a searing rebuke of Mr. Trump and the changes to the executive branch he has ushered in since returning to the White House in January.",
      "Noem has not yet responded to a request for comment, and Rubio has also not yet responded to a request for comment.",
      "Young accused the president of \"hollow bragging\" and said he \"ignores everything\" from the Constitution to civil laws to regulations, only to continue \"bullying on.\"",
      "Given that Mr. Trump is immune from prosecution, the judge said the president is prepared to deploy \"all the resources of the nation against obstruction.\"",
      "\"Behold President Trump's successes in limiting free speech \u2014 law firms cower, institutional leaders in higher education meekly appease the President, media outlets from huge conglomerates to small niche magazines mind the bottom line rather than the ethics of journalism,\" Young wrote.",
      "In July, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, settled a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million.",
      "The judge said Mr. Trump \"meets dissent from his orders in those other two branches by demonizing and disparaging the speakers, sometimes descending to personal vitriol,\" calling those he dislikes \"traitors.\"",
      "But Young praises the judiciary for rebuffing the Trump administration in its efforts to infringe on the First Amendment rights of those he dislikes, from law firms who challenged executive orders targeting them, to universities like Harvard that have been punished by the administration to news outlets like the Associated Press.",
      "\"I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,\" Young writes in closing. \"Is he correct?\"",
      "Young was appointed by Reagan to the federal bench in 1985 and called the case involving the administration's efforts to punish pro-Palestinian activists \"perhaps the most important\" to fall within the jurisdiction of the district court in Massachusetts.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/catastrophe-bonds-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

The program, known as VICP, provides a system for families to file claims against vaccine providers in cases where they experience severe side effects. Kennedy has also suggested broadening the definitions of two serious brain conditions \u2014 encephalopathy and encephalitis \u2014 so that autism cases could qualify.",
      "Either move, experts warn, would unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program's financial stability and handing vaccine opponents a powerful new talking point.",
      "Legally, HHS \"is required to undergo notice and comment rulemaking to revise the table,\" said Richard Hughes, a law firm partner who teaches at George Washington University. The \"table\" is a list of specific injuries that the U.S. government accepts as presumed to be caused by a vaccine if those injuries occur within a certain time window. If someone can show they meet these criteria, they have a simpler path to securing compensation without having to prove fault. Autism is not in the table because a link between vaccines and autism has been thoroughly debunked.",
      "If autism is added, Hughes explained, the VICP could face \"an exorbitant number of claims that would threaten the viability of the program.\"",
      "Asked about its possible plans, an HHS spokesperson told CBS News the agency does not comment on future or potential policy decisions.",
      "Carole Johnson, former administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees VICP, cautioned that the system is already overburdened: \"The backlog is not just a function of management, it's built into the statute itself. That's important context for any conversation about adding new categories of claims.\"",
      "Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco, said that any such change would be exploited: \"This can, and likely will, be used to cast doubt on vaccines.\"",
      "Compensation without causation",
      "The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was born of crisis. In 1982, \"Vaccine Roulette,\" a television documentary, aired nationwide, alleging routine childhood shots were causing seizures, brain damage and even sudden infant death. The program alarmed parents and triggered a surge of lawsuits against vaccine makers.",
      "\"That led to a flood of litigation against vaccine makers,\" recalled Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine inventor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"I mean, to the point that it drove them out of the business. \u2026 By the mid-1980s, there were $3.2 billion worth of lawsuits against these companies.\"",
      "Were it not for the VICP, said Offit, \"We wouldn't have vaccines for American children. The companies \u2014 it wasn't worth it for them.\"",
      "The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 created a no-fault system. Families who believed a vaccine caused harm could file a claim; if the injury appeared on the table within a set time frame, compensation was automatic. If not, claimants could present medical evidence. The system had two purposes: provide compensation and protect the vaccine supply.",
      "From the beginning, the table was understood not as a scientific document, but a legal tool.",
      "\"It's a legal document and things can be included for policy reasons even if the causation evidence is weak.\" said Reiss. She explained, \"The program is designed to be generous, to compensate in cases of doubt.\"",
      "But, she said, \"autism is not in that category. The science is clear. Adding it would be pure politics.\"",
      "This tension \u2014 between law, science and public perception \u2014 has defined the program for nearly four decades.",
      "What expansion would mean in practice",
      "Since 1988, federal data shows more than 25,000 petitions to the VICP have been adjudicated; of those, 12,019 were granted compensation and 13,007 were dismissed. About 60% of compensated cases involved negotiated settlements in which HHS drew no conclusion about the cause. Over that same period, billions of doses of vaccines were safely administered to millions of Americans.",
      "Adding autism to the VICP table would change that picture overnight.",
      "Federal estimates suggest up to 48,000 children could qualify immediately under a \"profound autism\" standard, with potential payouts averaging $2 million per case, at an initial cost of nearly $100 billion, followed by annual totals of about $30 billion a year \u2014 dwarfing the current $4 billion trust, a new analysis finds.",
      "\"Any case where the symptoms appeared in the past eight years and the parents blame vaccines,\" said Reiss. \"I don't know how many that would be. The fund has a surplus of over $4 billion. One seriously disabled child's care can cost millions, so a significant number, say 100,000 compensations, might exhaust it.\"",
      "Furthermore, with only eight special masters handling cases, the system would also be paralyzed by backlogs.",
      "The stakes are not just fiscal. If the fund collapses under the weight of autism claims, vaccine makers may question whether producing vaccines for the U.S. market is worth the risk. That would mirror the crisis of the 1980s, which led to the establishment of the VICP.",
      "Autism and the courts",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Dr. Andrew Wakefield's now-retracted paper alleging a link between the MMR vaccine and autism fueled a surge of VICP claims. By 2002, the VICP was swamped with petitions alleging vaccines had caused autism. The court consolidated thousands of cases into the Omnibus Autism Proceedings, selecting a handful of test cases to decide them all.",
      "After years of hearings and expert testimony, the conclusion was unequivocal: vaccines do not cause autism. In 2010, the court ruled against petitioners on every theory of causation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims affirmed, and the Court of Appeals upheld the decision.",
      "\"That precedent is binding,\" said Richard Hughes, a vaccine law expert at George Washington University and former VICP legal counsel. \"Autism was litigated thoroughly and rejected. That still carries weight in the court today.\"",
      "The ghost of Hannah Poling",
      "Yet, the vaccine-autism debate has never quite faded. In 2008, the government conceded a case involving Hannah Poling, a girl with a rare mitochondrial disorder who developed autism-like symptoms after vaccination. Officials stressed the concession was specific to her condition, not evidence of a general link. But headlines told another story: \"Family to Receive $1.5 Million in First-Ever Vaccine Autism Court Award.\"",
      "The Poling case fueled years of confusion.",
      "Autism science today",
      "The science is clearer than ever. Autism begins early in pregnancy, not in toddlerhood when most vaccines are given.",
      "\"Vaccinations \u2026 happened around the time families were recognizing symptoms of autism in their children,\" said Dr. Catherine Lord, a UCLA clinical psychologist and specialist in autism diagnosis. \"However, we now know that autism begins much earlier, likely as the fetus develops during pregnancy, so it cannot be an explanation.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine scientist at the Baylor College of Medicine who is also the father of a young adult with autism, underscores that point: \"The drivers of autism are genetics and, in rare cases, environmental exposures during pregnancy, not vaccines. We've been over this ground for decades, and the evidence is overwhelming.\"",
      "Sarah Despres, former legal counsel to the secretary of Health and Human Services in the Biden Administration and now a consultant to nonprofit organizations on immunization policy, adds that the compensation program itself is often misunderstood.",
      "\"The table was originally written as a political document,\" she said. \"The purpose of the program was to be swift, generous, and fair. \u2026 There would be cases that may not be caused by the vaccine, but would be compensated if you went through this table injury scheme where you don't have to prove causation.\"",
      "What's at risk: Harm from the diseases themselves",
      "The stakes are not abstract. Measles, one of the most contagious pathogens on earth, spreads so efficiently that one infected child can transmit it to 90% of susceptible contacts. Before vaccination in the 1960s, measles sickened millions annually in the U.S., killing hundreds and causing thousands of cases of encephalitis and lifelong disability. Complications included pneumonia, brain swelling, and in rare cases, a fatal degenerative brain disorder called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) that can strike years later. Earlier this year, a school-age child in Los Angeles County died of SSPE after contracting measles in infancy, before being eligible for vaccination.",
      "Mumps was once a near-universal childhood illness. Though often dismissed as mild, it can cause sterility in men, meningitis, and permanent hearing loss. Outbreaks on college campuses, as recently as the 2000s, showed how quickly it can return when vaccination rates slip.",
      "Rubella, also known as German measles, is mild in most children, but devastating in pregnancy. Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) caused waves of tragedy before the vaccine: thousands of babies each year born blind, deaf, with heart defects or with intellectual disabilities. In medical texts, autism itself is listed as one of CRS's sequelae, or possible consequences \u2014 proof that rubella infection, not vaccination, can contribute to developmental disorders.",
      "Measles, mumps and rubella \"are not trivial,\" said Dr. Walt Orenstein, former head of CDC's immunization program. \"Fever, high fever, is common \u2026 and they have frequent complications.\"",
      "And yet, as these diseases fade from living memory, a counter-narrative has gained traction. On Sept. 29, the nonprofit Physicians for Informed Consent, a group that disputes the scientific consensus on vaccines,\u00a0 announced it had mailed its \"Silver Booklet\" on vaccine safety to every member of Congress, as well as to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The book claims that \"vaccines are not proven to be safer than the diseases they intend to prevent,\" and calls on federal leaders to punish states that restrict vaccine exemptions. (The booklet isn't free. The group sells copies for $25 on Amazon.)",
      "Scientists say this framing misrepresents the basic math of risk. \"Measles is one of the most important infectious diseases in human history,\" notes \"Plotkin's Vaccines,\" the field's authoritative textbook. \"The widespread use of measles vaccines in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to a further marked reduction in measles deaths. Measles vaccination averted an estimated 31.7 million deaths from 2000 to 2020.\"",
      "Kennedy's possible move to expand the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program hinges on casting doubt \u2014 on suggesting that science is unsettled, that vaccines may be riskier than diseases.",
      "\"One tactic used to argue that vaccines cause autism is the use of compensation decisions from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to claim such a link,\" said Reiss of UC Law San Francisco. \"Even the cases that most closely address the question of vaccines and autism do not show the link that opponents claim exists, and many of the cases used are misrepresented and misused.\"",
      "Offit underscores the danger on the perception side. \"When people see the Vaccine Injury Compensation program, they assume that any money that is given is because there was a vaccine injury,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases and vaccine safety at Vanderbilt University, said, \"Expanding compensation for issues that are not clearly related to vaccines \u2026 suggests that these conditions are related to vaccines when they are not.\" She compared it to the removal of thimerosal, a preservative dropped from most childhood vaccines to ease public fears, despite no evidence of harm. \"Now, we are still suffering from that action.\"",
      "Public health experts stress that such narratives invert reality. The very diseases being downplayed once killed or disabled tens of thousands of American children each year. As pediatrician, psychiatrist, and medical historian Dr. Howard Markel put it: \"Back a hundred years ago, everybody lost a kid or knew a kid who died of one of these diseases. \u2026 We never conquer germs, we wrestle them to a draw. That's the best we do. And so this is a real \u2026 handicap to the other side, the microbes who live to infect.\"",
      "Families and the future",
      "The hardest voices to reckon with are those of families. Parents of autistic children often feel abandoned \u2014 unsupported by disability programs, exhausted by care needs, searching for answers. Kennedy's appeal to them is emotional, not scientific.",
      "Reiss noted that families deserve far more support, but argues that it shouldn't come through VICP.",
      "\"The program is to award compensation to those injured by vaccines,\" she said. \"We should have more direct support \u2014 disability funding, disability aid. Kennedy has been taking HHS in the opposite direction, cutting services where we need more.\"",
      "Despres made the same point: \"The goal of the program really was if there's a close call, we're going to err on the side of compensation. \u2026 And it's really important that everyone understands that compensation does not mean that the vaccine actually caused the injury. \u2026 And I think we have seen statistics around the compensation program misused by those who would want to sow distrust in vaccines, to say vaccines are unsafe, when in fact \u2026 that's not what this is.\"",
      "UCLA's Lord urged a shift in focus. \"For the last 50 years science has focused on the biological causes of autism, which has led to great progress, especially in genetics,\" she said. Of Secretary Kennedy, she said, \"he could help more by acknowledging the value of science, but also the need to better attend to the actual lives of autistic people and their families.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "If Kennedy decides to move forward with such a plan, HHS would need to draft a rule, open it to public comment and then defend the change in court. The pushback will be fierce: from scientists, from public health leaders and from families who fear being misled yet again.",
      "The debate over adding autism to the Vaccine Injury Table is not just a policy debate. The program was built on the principle of compensation without causation, a fragile balance designed to sustain both trust and supply. Adding autism could collapse that distinction entirely.",

    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

      "The plan, which Mr. Trump presented alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, is a 20-point proposal which, if agreed to, would see a swift ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all the remaining hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, an increased flow of humanitarian aid and the eventual transfer of control over the territory to an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats overseen by an international \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",

      "Mr. Trump's proposal does not include any immediate role for the PA in administering post-war Gaza, but it says the organization could eventually \"securely and effectively take back control of Gaza\" once it has implemented a series of reforms.",
      "The leaders of a number of Muslim majority nations, including key states in the Middle East, quickly signalled support for the plan. Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar issued a joint statement welcoming Mr. Trump's \"sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza\" and asserting their \"confidence in his ability to find a path to peace.\"",

Along these lines, the ministers welcome the announcement by President Trump regarding his proposal to end the war, rebuild Gaza, prevent the displacement of the Palestinian people and advance a comprehensive peace, as well as his announcement that he will not allow the annexation of the West Bank,\" the joint statement said.",

    "summary": "Police have identified a woman whose remains were found in a Canadian well nearly two decades ago. She was born in the 19th century, police said.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian authorities have identified a person known as \"The Woman in the Well\" nearly two decades after her remains were found.",
      "The woman, Alice Spence, was born in September 1881 and had moved to Canada from Minnesota in 1913, police said.",
      "In June 2006, crews excavating a site in Sutherland, Saskatoon, found an old well and a barrel containing preserved human remains, according to a news release from the Saskatoon Police Service. The area was previously the site of the Shore Hotel, a boarding house that was demolished in 1927, according to a news release from the private genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "The woman had been partially dismembered, police believed, and was wrapped in a burlap sack and stuffed in the barrel, Othram said. Police found clothes, including a fitted jacket and long skirt, that dated to between 1910 and 1920, Othram said. A broken necklace and men's clothing were also found.",
      "An autopsy determined the woman had died under suspicious circumstances, but authorities were unable to identify her despite years of investigation. Police developed a DNA profile, but found no matches, and facial reconstruction images released to the public turned up no answers, Othram said.",
      "In 2023, the Saskatoon Police Services submitted forensic evidence from the case to Othram. Othram's scientists were able to develop a DNA extract from the skeletal evidence. They built a comprehensive DNA profile, Othram said, which was used to generate \"new investigative leads\" that were returned to the police service.",
      "A breakthrough came in June this year, Saskatoon Police Service Sergeant Darren Funk said in a news conference. At an event in Ottawa, Funk heard the Toronto Police Service describe how they had used investigative genetic genealogy to solve a homicide. Investigative genetic genealogy uses the DNA of people who were related to the subject to help make an identification.",
      "Funk connected with the Toronto Police Service and asked them to review the case of \"The Woman in the Well.\" The Toronto Police Service's follow-up investigation led investigators to people who may have been the woman's relatives. Police collected reference DNA samples from those subjects, and those samples were compared to the woman's DNA profile. Authorities also used historical information and city archives to help make the identification.",
      "Alice Spence was married to a man named Charles Spence and had a daughter, Idella, police said. Spence's listing in a 1916 census was the last proof of life historians could find for her.",
      "The family's home in Sutherland was destroyed by a fire in 1918, police said. Other records show Charles and Idella Spence living with a housekeeper in 1921. Investigators believe that Alice's death occurred sometime between 1916 and the fire in 1918.",
      "Spence's descendants, located through forensic genetic genealogy, were largely unaware of their relative and her death, police said.",
      "The police service said it believes this is the oldest investigation in Canada to be solved with the assistance of investigative genetic genealogy. Saskatoon Police Service Chief Cameron McBride called it a \"testament to the determination and innovation of investigators throughout all these years.\"",

      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 11:46:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Eli Sharabi, who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023, before being released last February, explains why he remains optimistic for the future.",
    "story": [
      "\"You know, 50 meters underground, you actually understand the meaning in life,\" said Eli Sharabi. For 491 days, Sharabi was a Hamas hostage. \"That it's not your academic degrees and not your profession,\" he said. \"You miss your family and friends, and just wish for another minute with them.\"",
      "Held captive deep in tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi always imagined returning to his home in the Israeli Kibbutz Be'eri. \"Sunday Morning\" was with him earlier this month when he returned for the first time since his release. Time has seemingly stopped in this community just three miles from Gaza. Two years on, the shrubbery has grown up around his house. But there's no concealing the pain here.",
      "\"Wow,\" Sharabi said, getting emotional. \"I remember they grabbed me from here.\"",
      "His wife, Lianne, and their daughters, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were still inside, as Hamas terrorists overran their kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents.",
      "He said, \"This place used to help so much to Palestinian civilians \u2013 send them money and take some of them from the border to hospitals in Israel.\" Those memories are hard to reconcile with his last moments here.",
      "He says he knew he was being kidnapped: \"I understood Arabic. My last second in the house, I just turned my head and like that to my daughters and said, 'I'll come back.'\"",
      "It's a nightmare he details in his book \"Hostage,\" a gripping account of his ordeal, in which he wrote on page one, \"Five terrorists enter with weapons drawn. We are in our pajamas; they come with uniforms, balaclavas, and Kalashnikovs. They found us.\"",
      "\"I will never forget the fears in my daughter's eyes,\" he said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "In that horrible chaos of the day when 250 others were taken hostage, Sharabi was ultimately brought into a home and tied up.",
      "\"After 52 days, they moved us to the tunnels,\" he said. \"The first mosque we've seen, we got in, they opened the door on the floor, and we've seen the ladder and they asked us to climb down, something like 30 meters. It looked like the perfect grave.\"",
      "In the tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi was held with various hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later murdered by Hamas at age 24. Golberg-Polin often repeated a quote which stuck with Sharabi: \"He who has a why to live, can bear any how.\"",
      "\"You're looking for any source that give you hope, that give you strength,\" Sharabi said.",
      "His captors told him his wife and daughters were alive, seen at protests campaigning for his release. It was the \"why\" he needed to cope with that torture in the tunnels.",
      "\"They beat us,\" Sharabi said. \"One time they broke my ribs and I couldn't breathe properly for two or three months, and my friend needed to help me to stand to go to the bathroom. They undressed us every two weeks and look for things that maybe we are going to attack them with them.\"",
      "What did that experience do to him? \"It's very humiliating moments for you,\" he said, \"and especially when you are chained to your friends, leg by leg, and you need to go to the bathroom with him \u2026 you have to go together. It's very, very humiliating moment. There's no running water, so you use bottles. You can see the worms everywhere. Worms, rats, cockroaches.\"",
      "When we were in Kibbutz Be'eri in mid-September, explosions could be heard as Israel stepped up its ground offensive in Gaza. \"It's not nice, these explosions,\" Sharabi said. \"Especially when you think it's another 48 hostages remain there. Two years. It's awful for both sides.\"",
      "I asked, \"There are going to be people who watch this and say, 'You're giving this space to this man to share his story. What about the 60,000-plus people in Gaza who've been killed?'\"",
      "\"First of all, they need to remember who started October 7,\" Sharabi replied. \"If someone can explain to me how you fighting against a terror organization that hiding behind his own population without people to get hurt, innocent people, I don't know how to do it.\"",
      "He worries especially about another captive he left behind: 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Sharabi became a father figure to him in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "He says his mission now is to bring all of the hostages home. Sharabi has been fighting to get the remaining living hostages out, along with the bodies of those, like his brother, Yossi, who were killed in captivity.",
      "Sharabi's emotions are often close to the surface, but kept in check, even describing the unimaginable: being shackled. \"We were chained with iron chains on our legs, 24/7,\" he said. \"Every step you make, it's not more than three inches. It was a week before the release when they took it off, and our legs start to fly all over the place. We couldn't control them because we didn't know how to walk.\"",
      "When he was released, he'd lost 66 pounds. The handover was terrifying, he says, but he could endure anything just to hug his wife and daughters again. Then, he heard this from the social worker greeting him in Israel: Your mother and your sister waiting for you.",
      "Sharabi said when he heard that he said, \"'Well, just bring me Lianne and my daughters.' And she said, 'Well, your mother and your sister will tell you.'\"",
      "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel were among the 1,200 people killed on October 7, 2023.",
      "Next to their graves is a place for his brother, Yossi.",
      "Today, Sharabi said, \"I choose life. I need to be strong for them. I don't have the privilege to break. I'm really grateful for my second chance.\"",
      "He says he thinks of his wife and daughters and the life they missed. \"But I'm very positive the life I'm going to rebuild,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"How can you be so positive after losing so much?\"",
      "\"I love life. I love life,\" he replied. \"I'm very proud that I'm that meaningful for other people. It's the most moving feeling that you can feel, that people care about you. People say for me, 'We lose simple things, and we think our world is finished. And you lost your brother, your wife, and your daughters, and you're smiling today. How's that possible?'\"",
      "And his response? \"I can't do anything, anything that bring back Lianne, Noyia, Yahel, Yossi. And so, the best thing I can do for their memories is to be optimistic and to be strong and to rebuild my life.\"",

It's something the president's going to make the final determination on,\" Vance said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",
      "Axios reported Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had asked President Trump for the long-range missiles at a meeting between the two\u00a0at last week's U.N. General Assembly.

I think that gets them really invested in both what's happening in their own backyard, but also in the peace process that the president has been pushing for, for the last eight months,\" Vance said.",
      "The U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of about 1,500 miles, which would place Moscow well within the range of Kyiv should the Ukrainian government obtain them.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov implied that the U.S. was directly interfering in the war between Russian and Ukraine. \"Moscow has heard Washington's statements about possible Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine and is carefully analyzing them,\" Peskov said at a news conference. \"It is important to understand who will be directing and launching the Tomahawk missiles from Ukrainian territory \u2014 the Americans or the Ukrainians themselves.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News later on Sunday, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" in war and that Ukraine should have the ability to conduct long-range strikes on Russia.",

The attacks killed four people and wounded dozens more, Ukrainian officials said, and was one of the largest aerial barrages Ukraine has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russia's failure to come to the table to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, and he has offered Ukraine encouragement over the past week in its fight to repel Russian troops.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday.",
      "\"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,\" Mr. Trump said.",

      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",

Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "Four months after initially threatening a 100% tariff on U.S. films that are produced in other countries other than the United States, President Donald Trump further advanced the plan by announcing his solution to the \"never-ending problem\" that is allegedly killing Hollywood.",
      "\"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing \u2018candy from a baby.\u2019 California, with its weak and incompetent Governor, has been particularly hard hit!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. \"Therefore, in order to solve this long time, never-ending problem, I will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States.\"",
      "\"Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" he concluded.",

      "When it comes to the future of Hollywood, Steve Honig, founder of the Honig Company, told Fox News Digital that the once glamorous home of filmmaking has truly \"lost itself.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, Hollywood, and the entire metropolitan Los Angeles area, has been dying a slow death for several years now as far as runaway production goes,\" said Honig. \"The cost of living and doing business in the area has become beyond cost-prohibitive, with other parts of the country and the world offering a lot more for a lot less.\"",
      "\"The problem is not limited to just Southern California but rather the entire state,\" he continued. \"While the current administration has tried to increase tax incentives for productions, it hasn\u2019t been enough to really move the needle very much. In addition to losing business, Hollywood has found itself with a reputation problem.\"",
      "Trump first announced his plan to implement a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films back in May.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",
      "\"The Los Angeles area has become synonymous with high-costs and low-value among people in the industry, in particular the decision-makers,\" he added. \"This is going to be a tough issue to remedy because the problem goes a lot deeper than just tax incentives; it plays into the very soul of the city. Hollywood has lost itself in bad politics and economics.\"",
      "Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, says that Hollywood is not dead yet, but if the industry continues on this trajectory, a \"call to hospice is not far away.\"",
      "\"Why? Because of the decentralization of the creative process over the last 40 years. If you rewind the tape, the reason they called so many of those Clint Eastwood movies \u2018Spaghetti Westerns\u2019 is because it was cheaper to film in Italy--as well as southeastern Spain--than it was in Hollywood, or the Midwest, like most of the iconic John Wayne films, just 10-20 years earlier.\"",
      "\"Over the last couple of decades, Tinsel Town has lost its centralized strangle hold on movie-making, much in the same way that Detroit was unceremoniously dethroned as the auto-production capital of the world: tax breaks, cheaper labor, lack of union over-regulation, and advantageous incentives, all of which rendered Detroit a non-viable, cost-prohibitive option,\" Eldridge said.",
      "He explained that in recent years, other states have made moves to pull the movie industry out of California.",
      "Trump said in May that the movie industry is \"dying a very fast death.\" (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",
      "\"Let me qualify that. In recent years, states like Texas and Georgia have taken aggressive measures to lure studio production away from the Golden State, in favor of more dollar-stretching climates. Georgia created a 20% tax credit, with an additional 10% credit on top of that, if producers used the Georgia peach logo in the end credits. Similarly, Texas has committed $1.5 billion in tax credits over the next decade, to producers who choose to film in remote, rural, locations across the state and are willing to utilize Texas residents in the production,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge continued, \"By contrast, California has become increasingly stringent: economically (escalating tax brackets), lack of incentives, and a post-Covid environment and economy that has never rebounded to a sense of normalcy, post-pandemic. At the end of the day, Hollywood producers face the same reality as the rest of America: where can you stretch your dollar the farthest\u2014Bergdorf's or Walmart? At a certain point, the discussion and decision becomes purely economical. California better have 'movie-making hospice' on speed-dial, because the outlook isn't good.\"",
      "In May, Trump wrote that the \"Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "\"Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,\" Trump said. \"Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.\"",
      "The president said that the situation was a \"concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat.\"",
      "\"It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\" Trump wrote.",

      "Earlier this year, Rob Lowe took aim at the management within California when it comes to in-state filming and production.",
      "\"There are no tax credits, so like, all those other places are offering 40% \u2014 40%. And then on top of that, there\u2019s other stuff that they do,\" Lowe said in conversation with his former \"Parks and Recreation\" co-star Adam Scott in March, per The Wrap. \"And then, that\u2019s not even talking about union stuff. It\u2019s just tax, economics of it all, so it\u2019s criminal what California and L.A. have let happen \u2014 it\u2019s criminal. Everybody should be fired.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s cheaper to bring 100 American people to Ireland than to walk across the lot, Fox, past the sound stages and do it there,\" Lowe said of filming his TV show, \"The Floor.\"",

      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",

      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",

      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District has become the first in the country to combine AI gun detection with a mass communication system that speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted.

These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",

Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",

      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",

      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",

Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "The network was discovered as the Secret Service was investigating several telecommunications threats targeting senior government officials, according to authorities.",

      "As officials comb through forensic evidence from the trove of devices discovered across multiple states, authorities said they found evidence that the network was constructed by groups outside the country to communicate with cartels, terrorist organizations and other organized crime groups.",
      "\"What happens if they didn\u2019t find it?\" former NYPD Lt. Joe Cardinale told Fox News Digital. \"It could have been a different scenario.

They like to hear what\u2019s going on.\"",
      "Experts also indicated the massive scheme could have leveled the city\u2019s communications system during a time of crisis, potentially exposing a vulnerability for bad actors to exploit \u2013 similar to the technology blackouts that occurred during the Sept. 11 attacks.",

      "Upon discovering the telecom threat, investigators found over 100,000 SIM cards that had already been activated. However, many devices had yet to be booted up, suggesting the perpetrators were planning to double \u2013 or triple \u2013 the network\u2019s capacity.",
      "\"If it was for real \u2018bad guy purposes,\u2019 as in preparation for an attack, you could have made sure that nobody\u2019s getting the information they need to respond,\" Mauro said. \"It could have shut down the 911 systems. They probably had the ability to shut down specific areas, so it\u2019s not even like all of New York had to be taken down.\"",

No one can call each other, and you can only imagine the rest.\"",

      "Elon Musk has once again entered the British political fray, this time promoting a new right-wing party, Advance UK, while criticizing the leader of the rapidly growing and influential Reform UK party, Nigel Farage.",
      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, he addressed tens of thousands in London at the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally organized by the controversial right-winger Tommy Robinson. The billionaire joined the march by video link and condemned the left as \"the party of murder.\"",

      "The billionaire also took aim at the man who could be Britain's next prime minister and claimed Nigel Farage \"doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\" That was before the birth of Advance UK. More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",

      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",
      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also agrees that borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum seekers are living in hotels at the taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million per day ($7.4 million).",
      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Earlier this year, Irish comedian Graham Linehan was met by armed police at Heathrow Airport after making online comments about transgender people. Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "What is the impact on the CDC?",
      "The CDC will continue to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, but it will be hampered in providing the public with health-related information, its contingency plan said.",

      "Under the Pentagon contingency plan, employees working on intelligence activities deemed essential for national security will continue to report to work.",

      "Roughly 150,000 employees from CBP, ICE and the U.S. Secret Service will be affected by the shutdown, as well as about 47,000 U.S. Coast Guard employees."

      "That report found that the United States added only 73,000 jobs in July and reflected deep revisions to previous months\u2019 numbers. At the time of the report, it found job growth for May was revised down from 144,000 to just 19,000. It also marked down June\u2019s job creation from 147,000 to only 14,000.",

      "He said Antoni would \u201censure that the numbers released are honest and accurate.\u201d",
      "Multiple former commissioners of the Bureau of Labor Statistics said shortly after McEntarfer was fired that the head of labor statistics does not have a role in compiling the monthly jobs reports and is briefed on its contents only shortly before it is released to the public.",
      "Antoni, a contributor to Project 2025, was backed by Steve Bannon for the post. Antoni has been a skeptic of the data the BLS produces.",

      "Antoni\u2019s nomination came under scrutiny after the White House said he was a \u201cbystander\u201d at the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "An interview he gave to Fox Business Network on Aug. 4, before his nomination, also drew the attention of businesses and the markets. Antoni said the agency should suspend issuing the monthly job report and instead publish quarterly data until the reports are more \u201caccurate.\u201d",
      "The White House later said it remained \u201cthe plan\u201d to keep publishing the monthly jobs numbers on time.",
      "The data the bureau produces is considered the gold standard around the world and is massively important to businesses, policymakers and government agencies. Without it, the true condition of the U.S. economy might be harder to determine.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "If an asteroid is on a collision course with the moon, should it be deflected or blown up? A paper from NASA scientists and other researchers explores the options.",
    "story": [
      "If an asteroid is on a collision course with the moon, what should humanity do? Try to nudge the space rock out of the way before it strikes? Obliterate it with a nuclear explosion?",
      "Those are the questions explored in a recent paper from more than a dozen researchers, including several NASA scientists. And they're not purely hypothetical: An asteroid known as 2024 YR4 is estimated to have a 4% chance of hitting the moon in 2032.",
      "Such a cosmic collision could produce debris \u201cup to 1,000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft\u201d in low-Earth orbit, the researchers wrote in the paper, which was uploaded to the preprint website arXiv on Sept. 15 but has yet to be peer-reviewed.",
      "To avoid creating that potentially dangerous debris field, one option is to nuke the asteroid, according to the paper \u2014 or trigger what the scientists call a \u201crobust disruption\u201d \u2014 before it reaches the moon.",
      "Cue the \"Armageddon\" movie references.",
      "But using a nuclear explosion to destroy an asteroid has never been tested, so the plan would come with a slew of major risks.",
      "Various key characteristics about asteroid 2024 YR4 aren\u2019t known, including its mass, which would be critical in figuring out how to properly \u201cdisrupt\u201d it without creating more problems.",
      "\u201cIf the explosion is not enough, you\u2019re just going to create a debris field anyway,\u201d said Julie Brisset, interim director of the Florida Space Institute, who wasn\u2019t involved with the paper.",
      "Asteroid 2024 YR4 was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System station in Chile in December. NASA estimates that it measures up to 220 feet across, large enough to be considered a \u201ccity killer\u201d because it could be capable of causing severe damage to a city or region on Earth.",
      "Experts initially thought there was a small chance the asteroid could hit our planet, and the probability of such an impact was estimated to be as high as 3% earlier this year. But a collision with Earth was later ruled out.",
      "With Earth now thought to be in the clear, asteroid 2024 YR4 has an estimated 4.3% chance of smacking into the moon.",
      "The authors of the recent paper suggested launching a mission to conduct reconnaissance of the asteroid, including estimating its mass from up close. After that, they proposed, an explosive device could be built, then deployed to the space rock.",
      "Alternatively, if destroying the asteroid with a nuclear explosion is too extreme, the researchers detailed how it could be nudged out of the way.",
      "NASA has some experience with that: In a first-of-its-kind test in 2022, its DART probe intentionally crashed into a small space rock known as Dimorphos to alter its trajectory. The maneuver was carried out 6.8 million miles from Earth and changed Dimorphos\u2019 path in space, shortening its orbit by 33 minutes, according to NASA.",
      "But a successful deflection would also require knowing the mass of asteroid 2024 YR4, Brisset said.",
      "In response to an NBC News inquiry to NASA about the recent paper, Kelly Fast, the agency\u2019s acting planetary defense officer, said in a statement that there are no plans to deflect or otherwise interfere with the asteroid.",
      "However, she said there are plans to study it early next year using the James Webb Space Telescope. Any findings could provide better insight into its orbital path.",
      "\u201cIf observed, the additional data could improve our knowledge of where the asteroid will be in December 2032,\u201d Fast said, \u201cand could drop the impact probability to 0%.\u201d",
      "Even if space missions like those described in the paper could be carried out, there would be political considerations to navigate.",
      "Although no astronauts or long-term habitats are on the moon, that might not always be the case. China, for instance, has said it aims to land its astronauts on the moon by 2030. Chinese officials have also said the country may build a nuclear plant on the lunar surface to power a moon base that it plans to jointly operate with Russia.",
      "The United States plans to launch regular missions to the lunar surface before NASA eventually ventures to Mars. But NASA\u2019s future missions and priorities remain in flux amid significant personnel cuts and President Donald Trump\u2019s budget blueprint for NASA, which proposes slashing more than $6 billion from its budget.",
      "Detonating a nuclear device in space could also add tension to the burgeoning space race among the United States, China and other spacefaring countries, with potential conflicts over which countries and space agencies would lead or participate in the project, Brisset said.",
      "\u201cIt would probably be countries that have the technical capability to do it,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich maybe narrows it down to three or four, but would they want to work together?\u201d"

      "Ramyar serves as an advisor to Afghans for Progressive Thinking (APT), a youth-led non-profit that focuses on advancing women\u2019s rights and educational opportunities for girls. She added that the blackout has impacted her ability to serve those women, adding that her work \u201crelies heavily\u201d on online access and that the situation in Afghanistan continues to be \u201cunpredictable.\u201d",

    "summary": "Who gets engaged on 'Love Is Blind' Season 9? See a full list of the 2025 season set in Colorado.",
    "story": [
      "The first six episodes of \"Love Is Blind\" Season 9 ends, of course, in a few engagements. But there are unexpected twists, too, including multiple early departures.",
      "The Netflix dating series returned on Oct. 1 with a new set of singles based in Denver, Colorado. During the first batch of episodes, viewers watch participants make and break romantic connections in the dating pods.",
      "Who ends up getting engaged? Read on for a recap of the Season 9 dating pods.",
      "Ali and Anton",
      "Ali, a 29-year-old nurse, and Anton, a 29-year-old who works in the transportation and logistics field, hit it off from day one.",
      "In a confessional interview, Ali said she was looking for someone who matches her drive, especially since she's had to motivate her exes in the past. She described herself as \"soft\" and \"nurturing\" but admitted that she presents herself in a guarded way, perhaps to keep people away.",
      "Once she started talking with Anton, Ali was surprised by how quickly they connected. They found common ground when they learned that they both speak multiple languages and first started learning English when they were 8 years old. Their connection deepened when they talked about their cultural backgrounds and upbringings.",
      "Ali was first to declare her love, which inspired Anton to propose to her. When they met for the first time, sparks flew.",
      "Madison and Joe",
      "For Madison, a 28-year-old UX/UI designer, the \"Love Is Blind\" experiment was a case of art imitating reality. In the first episode, she explained that she has an eye condition that could make her go blind.",
      "When Madison started talking with Joe, a 29-year-old who works in sales, she opened up about her condition. He took a moment to process the news, but reassured her that he would be willing to support her through thick and thin.",
      "Joe got vulnerable while talking about his experience being engaged previously and explained that their love fell apart because they were too fundamentally different. Madison later told him he made her feel \"so accepted and so loved.\"",
      "Madison said \"I love you\" first, followed by Joe, and he soon proposed. After meeting, it took Joe a few minutes to connect the voice he heard in the pods to the person before him.",
      "Annie and Nick",
      "Nick, a 28-year-old luxury watch dealer, had a strong emotional connection with Kait, a 32-year-old registered dietitian, and quickly told her he thought she could be the one for him.",
      "He was also talking to Annie, a 31-year-old hair salon owner. In a confessional interview, Nick referred to Annie as his \"wildcard\" and said he was curious to see where things go.",
      "Annie was also talking to Brenden, a 32-year-old finance manager whom she called her \"number one\" because he was \"dependable.\"",
      "Over time, Annie told Nick he makes her feel \"comfortable\" and he said he will always fight for her. At the same time, he told Kait he was confident in their connection and that he loved her.",
      "Things took a turn for Nick and Kait when they discussed the topic of religion. Nick is more connected to his faith than Kait, who said she struggled with believing in a higher power after watching her mother suffer from cancer for 10 years and die.",
      "Annie told Nick she needed more validation from him since her connection with Brenden was so strong. The couple then had a deep conversation about parenting and sexuality. In her next date with Brenden, Annie was feeling the vibes and it looked as though the couple would progress to the next step in their relationship.",
      "Nick told Kait he felt like he was being pulled in two different directions, and she didn't take it well, especially since he had told her he loves her. The conversation spiraled and Nick ended things with Kait.",
      "Nick went all-in with Annie and told her he knew she was \"the one.\" He said he loved her and she reciprocated. Annie had a long conversation with Brenden, who really wanted their relationship to work. However, she and Nick ended up getting engaged.",
      "Megan and Jordan",
      "When Jordan, a 30-year-old service manager, spoke with Megan, a 35-year-old entrepreneur, he initially wrote her off at her nickname: \"Sparkle Megan.\" However, he changed his tune when he learned that she is smart and ambitious.",
      "Jordan, a single father of a 5-year-old son, connected with Megan on a deeper level when he told her his son has Type 2 diabetes and learned that her late father also had the condition. Jordan revealed that he got a vasectomy after welcoming his son, but said he would reverse it if he and Megan decided they wanted to have additional children.",
      "Despite her affection for Jordan, Megan wasn't sure that their lifestyles will fully mesh, especially since she had a connection with Mike, a 38-year-old real estate investor who seemed to match her drive for success.",
      "Meanwhile, Megan was also falling for Blake, a 34-year-old accountant who also lost his father. However, Blake's number one connection was Anna, a 28-year-old hairstylist.",
      "When Blake suddenly left the dating experiment, Megan was left to decide between Mike and Jordan. Mike seemed to match her more on a professional level, but her emotional connection with Jordan grew.",
      "Despite Mike's attempts to convince Megan to fight for their relationship, he reminded her of her exes too much. She ultimately decided to go with Jordan and they get engaged.",
      "Kalybriah and Edmond",
      "Edmond, a 29-year-old realtor, instantly felt comfortable being vulnerable with Kalybriah, a 29-year-old social worker. He opened up about his experience growing up in the foster care system and was touched to learn that Kalybriah runs a nonprofit group home.",
      "Edmond's larger-than-life personality and quirkiness were endearing to Kalybriah, and he was refreshed to hear that she has modern views on marriage and is ambitious about pursuing her career.",
      "During one date, Kalybriah read Edmond a love letter she wrote for him. Afterwards, he proposed to her and she accepted.",
      "Patrick and Kacie",
      "Kacie, a 34-year-old hair and makeup artist, developed a connection with Patrick, a 31-year-old construction manager.",
      "The duo spoke about ethnicity extensively in the dating pods. Kacie said her father once served a Mormon mission in Korea and her sister currently works as a singer in Korea. Patrick didn't reveal his ethnicity right away but alluded to it, saying that he's always struggled with being the only person of his ethnicity in his friend groups.",
      "When Kacie pressed Patrick to share what his ethnicity, he hesitated, saying he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cjudged\u201d for it, but then revealed that his parents are from South Asia. She reassured him that this changed nothing for her and explained that her siblings also date people from other ethnicities.",
      "Patrick also had a connection with Anna, a Chinese woman who said she has mostly dated white men. They connected over the fact that their parents are from different countries and they both speak more than one language.",
      "When Anna suddenly left the dating experiment, Patrick was left to explore his connection with Kacie. Their relationship sped up with sexual banter. However, Patrick questioned how much she really wanted him.",
      "Patrick later proposed and they met in person.",
      "Flash forward to the next episode and Kacie told producers she didn't believe that her attraction for Patrick would grow during the experiment. She then met with him and sent some confusing messages, making it seem as though she wanted to still date him, even though she told producers otherwise."

      "\u201cWe were in a lot of boardrooms around February time, and everyone was like, \u2018No, this is nothing. It\u2019s not going to happen\u2019. Then, by May, people were like, \u2018We need to do something with you guys.\u2019 When we first launched Tilly, people were like, \u2018What\u2019s that?' and now we\u2019re going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months,\u201d Van der Velden said in her presentation, according to Deadline.",

      "\"This is literally the mark of the end of the industry as we know it\u2026 say goodbye to actors,\" Oscar-nominated director Luca Guadagnino wrote on X. \"No one should be supporting this.\"",

      "Johansson's famously smoky voice was used in the 2013 science-fiction movie \"Her\" to power a fictionalized AI chatbot. OpenAI denied modeling the assistant after Johansson, but ultimately suspended using the voice.",
      "The use of artificial intelligence by film studios was also a crucial bargaining point in the actors' strike in 2023. Actors, directors and other creators were concerned their likenesses or voices could be used in films, movies and other creations without their compensation or consent.",
      "The SAG-AFTRA union weighed in with a statement after learning about Tilly Norwood.",
      "\"SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered,\" the union said. \"The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.",

      "\u201cIt has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we\u2019ve seen, audiences aren\u2019t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn\u2019t solve any \u2018problem\u2019 \u2014 it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.\u201d",

Their experience with race and belonging was incredibly textured,\u201d Radford says. \u201cExamining their history more closely gave me a nuanced appreciation for the context and environment in which they found themselves.\u201d",

      "I still couldn\u2019t believe I was here.",
      "I\u2019d spent the last few days rushing between classes, lost inside the labyrinth of buildings older than the country, hiding in corners of dusty libraries with books older than me. These initial two weeks following orientation were called \u201cShopping Period.\u201d We got to sample classes without commitment \u2014 no strings, no grades \u2014 just the freedom to learn.",
      "It was one of the many perks I\u2019d discovered in the crash course on privilege since I\u2019d arrived: rarely did the bounds of commitment or the burden of duty apply to this world of the elite. They always kept their freedom to choose. In fact, there seemed to be an entire series of \u201coff menu\u201d items in their universe, items that the rest of us plebeians never even knew existed.",

      "These kids had such agency. Or entitlement? Perhaps both. And I wasn\u2019t sure that was such a bad thing. If the kids in my high school had any fraction of the same, we would have known we deserved new books and fresh desks without drawings of male anatomy carved into them.",
      "We would have demanded better.",
      "Hell, maybe we would have even succeeded.",

      "A few students were already seated as I walked inside, pulling erasers and pencil sharpeners from the deep pockets of their backpacks. I made my way toward the edge of the classroom, choosing a seat just beneath the window, the sun shining brightly through panes of scratched glass. Taking a quick look around, I felt the buzz of chatter; faces, diverse and different, filled every chair.",
      "Suddenly, the double doors swung open with a bang and the professor came stumbling in.",
      "The famed Madame Carole.",
      "I\u2019d heard other students describe her as gloriously eccentric and lovably loopy, a Parisian woman in her seventies who constantly lamented the \u201crapidit\u00e9\u201d and \u201cvulgarit\u00e9\u201d of all things American.",
      "\u201cBonjour, tout le monde!\u201d she shouted to no one in particular, spreading her arms widely as a silk shawl dangled from her shoulders.Just as the professor began her introduction, a tall, bespectacled boy busted through the doors in a frenzy, the last student to arrive.",

      "I immediately felt nauseous: the dreaded \u201cfun fact.\u201d Why did every teacher think this exercise did anything besides make students sweat with embarrassment?",
      "I rummaged through my brain for something even slightly interesting as I listened to my classmates, eager to impress.

      "\u201cUmm, well, je suis Lily. Short for Liliana. I\u2019m from a town you\u2019ve never heard of in North Carolina. I\u2019m concentrating in Social Studies, which is just a fancy way of saying I\u2019m paying too much for a degree that my parents still refuse to tell their friends about. They think I\u2019m studying fourth grade geography.\u201d",
      "A ripple of laughter.",
      "My seatmate turned, smiling. What was that look in his eye? He leaned over.",
      "\u201cImmigrant parents?\u201d he whispered.",

      "\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d he said, sliding the last of his books into his brown messenger bag.",

McMahan was there to warm up the crowd before the competition began at 7:10 a.m. local time at the Bethpage Black course.",
      "She commented on the incident in response to a video shared on TikTok by content creator Pamela Wurst Vetrini in which Vetrini argues that McMahan was unfairly singled out despite the boorish behavior of the men in the crowd.",
      "\"Let me get this straight: thousands of men behaved poorly. They were screaming expletives, they were throwing things at women,\" Vetrini says. \"The U.S. played poorly, the whole U.S. team performed poorly, and all of it is because of one female comedian? You have got to be kidding me.\"",

      "Tina Turner's fans seem to agree that a new statue of the late music legend is simply not the best.",
      "The 10-foot-tall bronze statue was unveiled Sept. 27 during the annual Tina Turner Heritage Days celebration in Turner's hometown of rural Brownsville, Tennessee. It depicts the \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" singer, who died in May 2023 at age 83, performing in a mini-skirt and heels while holding a microphone.",
      "Fred Ajanogha, the Atlanta-based sculptor who created the statue, reportedly paid extra attention to capturing the essence of Turner's hair, which he compared to the \u201cmane of a lion,\" according to the AP.",
      "But after the Brownsville Haywood County Chamber of Commerce shared a video on Facebook showing the moment the statue was uncovered near a museum honoring Turner at the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center, fans began expressing disappointment.",
      "\"That statue should have been kicked down after the unveiling. That is a very poor replica of what is supposed to be The Iconic Tina Turner. So Disrespectful!\" one wrote beneath the video while another fan said whoever paid for the statue should \"get their money back.\"",
      "The statue also met with criticism on X, with one disappointed Turner fan calling it a \"tragedy,\" and writing, \"She deserves better.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the Tina Turner statue is hilarious. I can\u2019t look at it without laughing. And that\u2019s my girl, but why they do that to her hair?\" wrote someone else.",
      "Another music lover questioned how anyone could take the statue of Turner seriously. \"At this point Im convinced that these so-called sculptors are trolling us,\" the person wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, others who seemed to know something about art blamed the medium rather than the sculptor, like the person who posted side-by-side pics of the Turner statue next to a notorious 2009 statue of comedy legend Lucille Ball that was so hated, the sculptor ended up apologizing for it.",
      "\"Some bronze statues,\" the person reasoned, \"just don\u2019t turn out that well.\""

      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",

At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.",
      "Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.",
      "Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.

This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.",
      "A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.",
      "A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.",
      "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.",
      "Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.",
      "A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.",

The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.",

As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.",

      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",

      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",
      "Despite Pezeshkian\u2019s moderate position on the issue of hijab, observers say he has little power to stop security forces who have used the war with Israel last June as a pretext to carry out mass arrests of ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interview was conducted with a government interpreter present and translating in real time, and NBC News reviewed the translation independently.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war. We  will never be starting any wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut whomever attacks us, we will do our utmost to give them the strongest answer. We will certainly augment our capabilities on a daily basis so as to prevent anyone from attacking us,\u201d Pezeshkian added.",
      "Injury during an airstrike",
      "Pezeshkian, who practiced as a doctor before entering politics, addressed an injury he sustained during the 12-day war with Israel in June, during which senior military leaders, scientists and hundreds of Iranian civilians were killed. Twenty-eight Israelis died during the conflict.",
      "\u201cThey hit us because they were seeking to martyr us like everyone else. We are not afraid of death and martyrdom. We have lived our lives. I have lived my life,\u201d he said.",
      "As for his wounded leg, Pezeshkian said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can just say that it was a hematoma formed in the region of the knee. We dropped the needed liquid and blood, and after that, we got over it,\u201d he added."

      "President Donald Trump's peace plan was met with cautious optimism Tuesday by leaders across the Middle East and the world, but others were more skeptical about the proposal \u2014 and whether it would be welcomed by Hamas.",
      "The plan was unveiled by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after talks that appeared to exclude Hamas, with the militant group saying \u201cnot a single Palestinian\u201d had seen the plan before it was announced.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that Hamas had \"three or four days\" to respond to the plan, adding that there would be \"not much\" room for negotiation. If Hamas were to reject the deal, he told reporters as he departed the White House, he would let Israel \"go and do what they have to do.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Affairs Ministry said that mediators Qatar and Egypt delivered Trump\u2019s plan to Hamas on Monday in Doha and that a discussion would take place later Tuesday.",
      "As the world awaited Hamas' response, global powers lined up behind the U.S.-backed plan to end the Israeli assault and free hostages still held in the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "In a joint statement, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan welcomed the 20-point plan, calling Trump's efforts \"sincere.\"",
      "It also received support from Europe, where a number of countries had recently defied Washington to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron urged Hamas to agree to the plan, while Germany and the European Union itself offered public backing.",
      "Trump branded the moment a \u201chistoric day for peace\u201d \u2014 but he warned that if the militant group did not agree to the proposal, Israel would have U.S. backing to \u201cfinish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.\u201d",
      "Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of Gaza's Hamas-run government media office, called the plan an \"attempt to impose a new form of guardianship\" on the besieged enclave. But Hamas said Tuesday that it would study the plan before providing its official response, The Associated Press news agency reported.",
      "The plan would require Hamas members to lay down their arms, a demand the group has previously rejected.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially runs the occupied West Bank, welcomed the plan, praising Trump for his \"sincere and tireless efforts\" to \"end the war on Gaza\" and reiterating its commitment to making reforms that could pave the way for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza would end immediately once it\u2019s agreed by both sides, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within a 72-hour period. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possibility \u2014 but not a guarantee.",
      "And hours after announcing the plan alongside Trump, Netanyahu vowed again to oppose a Palestinian state. \"Instead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer and former adviser to Yasser Arafat\u2019s Palestinian Liberation Organization, said Palestinians and leaders across the Middle East had little choice but to accept the plan.",
      "She nonetheless criticized it as having \u201cnot a single guarantee\u201d for the people of Gaza, who would be overseen by an international security force and a transitional authority chaired by Trump.",
      "\"Because everybody wants to see an end to the genocide, you're going to see that so many people are going to welcome this plan,\"  Buttu told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "But, she said, \"there\u2019s not a single guarantee that\u2019s being given to Palestinians, not one.\" Buttu added that she had little faith in the possibility that the plan if executed would lead to internationally recognized Palestinian statehood.",
      "In Gaza, weary Palestinians have long been desperate to see an end to Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the enclave.",
      "\u201cLife is unbearable, there\u2019s nothing \u2014 no food, no drinks no clothes,\u201d Abdallah Qamar told the AP last week from famine-stricken Gaza City, where Israel has been carrying out a sweeping ground offensive.",
      "In Israel, the plan to end the assault is likely to be welcomed by many within a populace increasingly critical of the war. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages, welcomed the plan.",
      "For Ilay David, whose brother Evyatar remains in captivity in Gaza and is believed to be alive, the plan offers a glimmer of hope.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying not to get my expectations too high. I try to protect my soul because in this very long journey it happened many, many times that we saw this maybe a resolution to this issue. And then boom, something collapses, something is messed up and everything goes much much back. I pray. I pray,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview.",
      "He added, \u201cTo see the support worldwide from side to side in Israel and abroad, maybe it is different.\u201d",
      "The proposal is unlikely to win favor, however, among the far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition upon whom his leadership relies.",
      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he believed Trump's plan would only \"end in tears,\" calling early celebrations \"absurd.\"",
      "On that, Buttu agreed, condemning the apparent lack of involvement of Palestinians in the bid to determine their future.",
      "\"They're deciding and talking about Palestinians, but never to Palestinians \u2014 and that's the part that is truly terrifying.\""

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 He is the U.K.'s most unpopular leader on record \u2014 more disliked, polls say, than even Liz Truss, the woman famously outlasted by a lettuce.",
      "Little over a year after he won a historic landslide victory, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces what could be a make-or-break moment as he fights for his political future.",
      "The embattled leader is set to tell his restive Labour Party that it is in a \u201cfight for the soul of our country\" in an address Tuesday at its annual conference in Liverpool.",
      "Starmer, 63, faces threats from all sides.",
      "The Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a staunch ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading the polls. He has capitalized on discontent over the cost of living, which has risen amid concern over immigration.",
      "It is a familiar story across Europe, where mainstream centrists such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz are being outpolled by nationalists and populists on the hard right.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempted fightback has been to reject Farage \u2014 whom he called \u201cracist\u201d this week \u2014 but also to deploy tougher talk on immigration himself.",
      "He is set to tell the party in Liverpool that it must make \u201cdecisions that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect,\u201d according to a partial transcript the party released ahead of time.",
      "Starmer \"needs to stamp his authority on the party and show he has a political story to tell that they can rally round,\" said Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank and a professor at King's College London.",
      "Not only has that strategy so far failed to shift Starmer\u2019s dismal polling, but it has also triggered dismay from Labour\u2019s traditional left-of-center support base. It accuses him of abandoning Labour\u2019s foundational liberal values.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he turns it around by leaning into Reform party rhetoric, which presents migrants and asylum-seekers as the fundamental problem in Britain \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cBritain\u2019s fundamental problem is economic,\u201d Lucas told NBC News. And so the question for Starmer is: \u201cCan you return to Labor\u2019s focus on public services, on competence and on finding a way forward which relies more on consensus rather than division?\u201d he added.",
      "The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Starmer's negative polling and the criticism of his leadership.",
      "The world\u2019s sixth-largest economy is suffering from years of sluggish growth and stubborn inflation that is forecast to be the highest this year among the G-7, a club of Western nations that includes the United States and Canada.",
      "As in the United States, that has driven up prices for everyday goods, but real wages in Britain have stagnated since the global financial crisis of 2008. Subsequent budget cuts have left public services such as the National Heath Service crumbling in the face of rising demand.",
      "During last year's election, Starmer promised the British public that he would not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 including income tax. But economic headwinds have fueled speculation that he may be forced into a U-turn in November's annual budget. Starmer has already been forced into humiliating climbdowns on pensioners' winter fuel payments and welfare reform.",
      "He has also announced the introduction of digital ID cards \u2014 an attempt to clamp down on people working illegally that has been criticized by civil liberties groups \u2014 as well as formal recognition of Palestinian statehood, which has caused friction with Trump and whose critics say is too little, too late.",
      "Though Starmer is technically safe until 2029, the scheduled date of the next election, he could come under threat before then if his party decides his leadership has become too toxic. The Labour Party conference this week has been awash with rumors that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester often described in British media as \u201cthe King of the North,\u201d could mount a leadership challenge.",
      "Burnham has cooled that talk, but even so, it has been a tumultuous year for Starmer\u2019s internal operation.",
      "During the election, he ran on a platform of decency and abiding by the rules, an antithesis to the scandal-plagued ruling Conservative Party.",
      "That narrative has been weakened by a series of ministerial resignations, culminating in that of Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, after it was revealed she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer has also carried out a radical overhaul of his internal communications team in a bid to reverse his downward fortunes. On Tuesday, his press office said his speech would mark a \u201cfork in the road\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cThe question is, fork-in-the-road moment for what?\u201d said Lucas, of University College Dublin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fork-in-the-road moment for Labour, at least in terms of where are we going to go with the question of immigration and a proper asylum system. Can Starmer show that he still has authority within the party when you\u2019ve got a rising hard right?\u201d"

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was appropriated by Congress.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the administration would have to spend the funds by the end of the month, but the Supreme Court's decision puts that on hold.",
      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "Yet again, the majority nevertheless granted the emergency request made by the government without hearing oral arguments or issuing a fully reasoned decision, she added.",
      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""
