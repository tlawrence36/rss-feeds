      "Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88.",
      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",
      "She was first spotted by \u201cLaugh-In\u201d creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on \u201cThe Steve Allen Comedy Hour.\u201d",
      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \u201cLaugh-In\u201d when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\u201cI think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\u201d he wrote in his 2023 memoir \u201cStill Laughing A Life in Comedy.\u201d \u201cI must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\u201d",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that\u2019s almost everyone at some time or other.\u201d",
      "Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others.",
      "Her other recurring characters on \u201cLaugh-In\u201d included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant.",
      "\u201cI never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. \u201cI was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.\u201d",
      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \u201cLaugh-In\u201d co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor.",

      "LONDON -- Actor-comedian Russell Brand was granted conditional bail by a London court on Friday after appearing to face charges of rape and sexual assault involving four women.",
      "Brand, 49, did not enter a plea. He previously denied the allegations made against him.",
      "He was swarmed by photographers as he arrived at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court for his first hearing since he was charged last month with one count each of rape, indecent assault and oral rape, as well as two counts of sexual assault.",
      "Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told Brand to present himself at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey, in central London on May 30 and granted him bail on condition he keeps the court informed of where he is staying, either in the U.K. or in the U.S. He currently lives in Florida but is obliged to attend all future court appearances. If he doesn't abide by the conditions, he faces being remanded in custody.",
      "The comedian, author and \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor, who wore an open shirt and jeans, listened intently to the details of the charges as he sat in the dock. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and that he understood his bail conditions.",
      "The alleged offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in the Westminster area of central London. The accusers have not been identified.",
      "Brand has been interviewed by police about the allegations, which he denies. Brand has denied engaging in \u201cnon-consensual activity.\u201d In a video posted on X after he was charged, Brand said he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "Brand is alleged to have raped a woman in 1999 at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a Labour Party conference in the town. It is alleged that while the woman went to the bathroom, Brand removed some of his clothing and later pushed her on the bed, removed her underwear and raped her.",
      "A second woman accuses Brand of grabbing her by the forearm and attempting to drag her into a male toilet at a television station in London in 2001.",
      "A third accuser was a television worker Brand met in Soho, central London, in 2004. He is accused of grabbing her breasts before allegedly pulling her into a toilet and orally raping her.",
      "The final complainant is a radio station worker who met Brand while he was working for Channel 4 on a spin-off of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program between 2004 and 2005. Brand is alleged to have grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before grabbing her breasts and buttocks.",
      "The charges follow a September 2023 joint investigation by British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times.",
      "Known for his unbridled and risqu\u00e9 standup routines, Brand hosted shows on radio and television and wrote memoirs charting his battles with drugs and alcohol. He has appeared in several Hollywood movies and was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012.",
      "In recent years, Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories. He recently said he had moved to the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",

      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",

      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",

      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

      "He\u2019s a dream in the kitchen \u2014 and elsewhere in the house. He makes a mean cream-puff tower. And he\u2019s got moves like Jagger.",
      "Alas, Antonin Car\u00eame has been dead since the 1830s, but nobody\u2019s perfect, right?",
      "Most people have heard of Napoleon, but not many are familiar \u2014 even in France \u2014 with the story of this chef who cooked for him and his contemporaries, rising from a poor kitchen boy to become a standard-bearer of French cuisine. Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",
      "But for the vibe, think \u201cThe Bear,\u201d set in post-revolutionary Paris. Car\u00eame even directs his staff at one point to say \u201cOui, chef.\u201d (And we could totally imagine him, like Jeremy Allen White, in a Calvin Klein underwear ad, if those had existed back then.)",
      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",
      "Still, his goal was to be the best chef in the world. The show\u2019s first season ends with an extraordinary outdoor coronation banquet that Car\u00eame creates for thousands of people. When he places, in triumph, a tall white chef\u2019s hat on his head for the first time, it's as if he's crowning himself \u2014 and marking his ascent to celebrity.",
      "Benjamin Voisin, who's in virtually every scene, plays Car\u00eame with a scruffy head of hair, a gold earring and a bad-boy swagger that's consciously based on Mick Jagger, circa \u201970s.",
      "Director Martin Bourboulon says the choice for the role was obvious once Voisin walked into the audition room.",
      "\u201cWhen you find the right actor for the right part, 80% of the job is done,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were very impressed with his youthful attitude but also his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll attitude. He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",

It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",

      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "This story has been corrected to show that Haley is 48, not 47.",

      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

      "More U.S. children have died this flu season than at any time since the swine flu pandemic 15 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. children have died this flu season than at any time since the swine flu pandemic 15 years ago, according to a federal report released Friday.",
      "The 216 pediatric deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eclipse the 207 reported last year. It's the most since the 2009-2010 H1N1 global flu pandemic.",
      "It's startling that the number already is this high, given that the flu season is still going on. The final pediatric death tally for the 2023-2024 flu season wasn't counted until autumn.",
      "\u201cThis number that we have now is almost certainly an undercount, and one that \u2014 when the season is declared over, and they compile all the data \u2014 it's almost certain to go up,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "There are likely several contributors to this season's severity, but a big one is that fewer children get flu shots, added O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.",
      "Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O'Leary said, adding that the decline in vaccinations \u201cis certainly playing a role\" in this season's loss of life.",
      "The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as \u201c highly severe,\u201d and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.",

      "Kanyeyachukwu Tagbo-Okeke, who is autistic, executed a painting featuring a multi-colored ribbon \u2014 the symbol for autism \u2014 surrounded by emojis, covering 12,304 square meters. That's a lot bigger than a typical soccer field, which is 7,140 square meters.",
      "The massive painting is aimed at highlighting the spectrum disorder and challenges that people like him face amid stigma and limited resources in Nigeria.",
      "\u201cI felt fine. Happy. Just fine,\u201d said Tagbo-Okeke, whose disorder limits his speech.",
      "His artwork eclipsed that of Emad Salehi, the previous world record holder, who was nearly three times older at 42 when he set the record with a 9,652-square meter canvas.",
      "The artwork, created in November 2024, was unveiled and officially recognized by the Guinness World Record organizers in Nigeria\u2019s capital of Abuja during the World Autism Acceptance Day in April.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s art and culture minister Hannatu Musawa said Tagbo-Okeke's artwork is \u201ca beacon of hope and inspiration\u201d for people with autism.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the unique abilities and potential of individuals with autism and are dedicated to providing opportunities for them to thrive in the creative industries,\u201d Musawa added.",
      "Born in Canada before moving to Nigeria, Tagbo-Okeke's upbringing has been challenging, his family said. His father told The Associated Press during a recent interview that there was often fear, confusion and sadness along the way.",
      "\u201cNot being able to communicate with your son or have regular activities you could have with any other child is quite depressing,\u201d Tagbo Okeke said.",
      "Many people on the spectrum face stigma and limited resources in Nigeria, but Tagbo-Okeke's family was determined to give him the best support.",
      "The young artist's record-breaking attempt, accompanied by a campaign tagged \u201cImpossibility is a Myth,\" was widely celebrated among Nigerians, partly because of his young age.",
      "\u201cWe felt an overwhelming sense of relief and pride, knowing the countless hours and months of effort he poured into breaking the record,\u201d his mother Silvia said.",
      "Many young people in Nigeria have attempted to break the Guinness World Record in recent years. At least seven Nigerians have broken world records in the past three years, including Hilda Baci, who won the longest cooking marathon and Tunde Onakoya, who played the longest chess marathon.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu\u2019s world record attempt also sought to raise funds for the Zeebah Foundation, a nonprofit focusing on providing support to those on the spectrum and their families.",
      "While there are no official records from within Nigeria, about 1 in 100 children worldwide is autistic, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Like in many other countries, autism is often not diagnosed in Nigeria until in older years.",
      "The lack of reliable data on autism, adequate awareness and government support for the spectrum disorder are some of the biggest challenges autistic people face in Nigeria, said Stanley Effah, founder of the Ferdinand Effah Music Heritage Foundation.",
      "Effah, whose child is autistic, said his foundation is planning to launch an annual musical concert featuring major artists as part of efforts to raise awareness about autism in Nigeria.",
      "Access to stem cell therapy for autistic children should also be included under the Nigerian National Health Insurance plan as a way to improve their care, Effah said.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu's mother said more government support was key to provide those on the spectrum the care they need early on in life.",
      "Kanyeyachukwu was only diagnosed in Canada after years of failed attempts in Nigeria, the father said. The diagnosis paved the way to properly support him, including his love for drawing, discovered at the age of 4.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work with him,\u201d he said. \"Kanye can tidy his room, he can wash his clothes \u2014 all of this is because of early intervention. If left alone, he definitely would not be able to do these things.\u201d",

      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is again trying to rehire some staffers who were recently fired amid mass layoffs at the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.",
      "More than 20 of the agency\u2019s roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.",
      "The same uncertainty hangs over employees who process agency records for release to lawyers, companies and journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. About 100 of those staffers were recently eliminated, according to an agency official with direct knowledge of the situation.",
      "But in recent days the FDA has missed multiple court-ordered deadlines to produce documents, which could result in hefty fines. That's prompted plans to bring back a significant number of those staffers.",
      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services hasn't detailed exactly which positions or programs were cut in the mass layoffs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",
      "On Monday, staffers were informed that about a third of the fired staff who performed the work would be returning.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",

      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",

      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A South African woman was convicted Friday of kidnapping and selling her 6-year-old daughter in a case that horrified the country. The girl went missing more than a year ago and hasn't been found.",
      "Kelly Smith and two men \u2014 her boyfriend and their friend \u2014 were convicted of kidnapping and human trafficking over the disappearance of Smith's daughter, Joshlin, who was 6 when she went missing in February 2024.",
      "Smith \u2014 whose full name is Racquel Chantel Smith \u2014 was initially a figure of sympathy when her daughter went missing. Community members rallied around her and volunteered to help police search for Joshlin in the sand dunes near their poor neighborhood of shacks close to the west coast town of Saldanha Bay, around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Cape Town.",
      "A photograph of Joshlin smiling and with her hair tied in pigtails was broadcast by news stations across South Africa as police then launched a nationwide hunt.",
      "Smith said she had left Joshlin with her boyfriend on the day she disappeared, but the case took a shocking twist when Smith was arrested.",
      "A woman testified during the trial that Smith had told her she and the two men had sold Joshlin for around $1,000 to a traditional healer who wanted the child for her body parts. The judge's verdict did not make any conclusions on who the child was sold to or exactly what happened to her.",
      "Smith, her boyfriend Jacquin Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn face life in prison and the judge said sentencing hearings will begin next week.",
      "People attending the trial cheered and applauded when Judge Nathan Erasmus read out the guilty verdicts. The trial was held in a Saldanha Bay sports center that had more space than a courtroom so that members of the community could attend.",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday he will visit U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The high-stakes meeting comes as Trump continues his trade war and annexation threats.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party scored a stunning comeback victory in a vote widely seen as a rebuke of Trump, whose trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty outraged voters.",
      "\u201cCanadians elected a new government to stand up to President Trump and build a strong economy,\u201d Carney said in his first remarks since since election night.",
      "Carney also said King Charles III will deliver a speech outlining the Canadian government's priorities on May 27, when Parliament resumes. Charles is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "Carney has emphasized Canada's oldest allies, the United Kingdom and France, since becoming prime minister after the resignation of Justin Trudeau. Carney repeated that the the old relationship with the U.S. based on steadily increasing integration is over.",
      "\"On Tuesday, I had a very constructive call with President Trump, and we agreed to meet next Tuesday in Washington,\" Carney said. \u201cMy government will fight to get the best deal for Canada.\u201d",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s government on Friday rejected a ruling from the United Nations\u2019 top court ordering the South American country to refrain from holding elections for officials who supposedly would oversee a resource-rich region in neighboring Guyana that both nations claim as their own.",
      "The government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a statement underscored its historical position to not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and asserted that international law does not allow the body to \u201cinterfere\u201d or \u201cattempt to prohibit\u201d an election.",
      "The government\u2019s statement came a day after the court, based in The Hague, issued the ruling at the request of Guyana, which accused Venezuela of violating an earlier order by planning to hold elections May 25 for a governor and other officials to administer the Essequibo region.",
      "The Essequibo \u201cis an inalienable part of the Venezuelan territory and a legacy of our liberators,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cIts defense is a historical, constitutional, and a moral mandate that unites the entire Bolivarian Homeland. No international pressure, judicial blackmail, or foreign tribunal will make us back down from this conviction.\u201d",
      "The area under dispute represents two-thirds of Guyana and is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources. It also is located close to massive offshore oil deposits, with current production averaging some 650,000 barrels per day.",
      "Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period. It has long dismissed the border drawn by international arbitrators in 1899, when Guyana was still a British colony.",
      "After years of fruitless mediation, Guyana asked the world court in 2018 to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding. Venezuela argues that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising.",
      "In late 2023, Maduro threatened to annex the region by force after holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. Days later, Caribbean leaders, joined by Brazil and the U.N., held an emergency summit where Guyana and Venezuela agreed to refrain from using force. But the dispute continues.",
      "In March, Guyana\u2019s president denounced an incursion by an armed Venezuelan naval vessel in disputed waters that are home to a major offshore oil deposit being developed by ExxonMobil. Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez disputed Ali\u2019s claims and called ExxonMobil\u2019s oil installations \u201cillegal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In a protected part of the Amazon, Bacuri, a young manatee that was found stranded and alone, is being raised in captivity",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- Deep in silence, as if under a spell, children watch intently as Bacuri, a young Amazonian manatee, glides around a small plastic pool. When he surfaces for air, some of them exchange wide smiles. The soft rustle of rainforest leaves punctuated by bird song adds to the magic of the moment.",
      "The children from riverside communities traveled for hours by boat just to meet Bacuri at the field station of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, Brazil\u2019s oldest research institute in the Amazon. Despite their endangered status, manatees are still hunted and their meat illegally sold, and they are increasingly threatened by climate change. Environmentalists hope that by engaging local communities, Bacuri and others like him will be spared.",
      "The Amazonian manatee is the region\u2019s largest mammal but is rarely seen, much less up close. The reasons for this are twofold: The manatee has acute hearing and will vanish into the murky water at the slightest sound; and its population has dwindled after being overhunted for hundreds of years, mostly for its tough hides that were exported to Europe and Central America.",
      "To help the manatee population recover, several institutions are rescuing orphaned manatee calves, rehabilitating them and reintroducing them to the wild.",
      "Bacuri weighed just 22 pounds (10 kilograms) \u2014 a fraction of the more than 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of an adult manatee \u2014 when he was rescued and taken to the museum's research center in the federally protected Caxiuana National Forest. He was named after the local community that found him. Two years and several thousand milk bottles later, Bacuri has grown to about 130 pounds (60 kilos).",
      "Three institutions are responsible for his care. The Goeldi Museum provides facilities and educates nearby communities. The federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation assigns two staffers for 15-day shifts to feed Bacuri three bottles of milk a day as well as chopped beets and carrots, and clean the pool every 48 hours. The nonprofit Instituto Bicho d'Agua\u2014 meaning institute of water animals in Portuguese \u2014 oversees veterinary care, dietary planning and caregiver training.",
      "During their visit, the children learn that female manatees are pregnant for about a year then nurse their young for two more, feeding them from nipples behind their front flippers \u2014 the manatee equivalent of armpits. This long reproductive cycle is one reason the manatee population has not recovered from the commercial hunting that persisted until the mid-20th century.",
      "They also learn the species is endangered and that they are the ones who must protect it.",
      "\u201cYou are the main guardians,\u201d biologist Tatyanna Mari\u00facha, head of the scientific base, tells the children, who spend the rest of the day drawing and making Play-Doh models of Bacuri.",
      "With its auditorium, dormitories, observation towers, cafeteria and laboratories, the research station \u2014 two hours by speedboat from Portel, the nearest city \u2014 stands in stark contrast to nearby communities comprising clusters of wooden houses on stilts where families rely on cassava farming, fishing and harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed berries. School field trips and community outreach aim to narrow the gap.",
      "\u201cCaxiuana is their home,\u201d Mari\u00facha told The Associated Press. \u201cWe can\u2019t just come here and do things without their consent.\u201d",
      "Local knowledge will play a key role when Bacuri is finally released. He is the only manatee calf under care at Caxiuana. Once he has fully transitioned to a plant-based diet, he\u2019ll spend time in a river enclosure before his release. That site will be selected based on where residents say wild manatees feed and pass through.",
      "If all goes as planned, Bacuri will be the first released in the Caxiuana area. Two other calves rescued in poor health died in captivity, a sadly common outcome.",
      "While subsistence hunting isn\u2019t a major threat to the species, some fishermen still sell manatee meat illegally in nearby towns. Brazil banned hunting of all wild animals in 1967, with two exceptions: Indigenous peoples are allowed to hunt, and others can kill a wild animal to satisfy the hunger of the hunter or his family.",
      "The threat of hunters has become harder to manage due to climate change, said Miriam Marmontel, a senior researcher at the Mamirau\u00e1 Institute for Sustainable Development, hundreds of miles (kilometers) upstream along the Amazon River.",
      "Dozens of dolphins died near Mamiraua in 2023, likely due to soaring water temperatures during a historic drought. Manatees avoided mass mortality then because they typically inhabit deep pools during the dry season, but recent droughts have dramatically reduced the water level, making manatees more vulnerable to poachers.",
      "\u201cAs climate change accelerates, manatees may begin to suffer from heat stress too,\u201d Marmontel said. \u201cThey also have a thermal limit, and eventually it may be crossed.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s why reintroduction efforts are so important.",
      "Around 60 rescued manatees are being cared for across the state of Para, where Caxiuana is located. Bicho d\u2019Agua is caring for four in partnership with the Federal University of Para and Brazil's environmental agency. One of the four, named Coral, was found near \u00d3bidos and airlifted 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to the institute's facility in Castanhal. She arrived dehydrated and with severe skin burns, likely from sun exposure.",
      "\u201cThe population has declined so much that every hunted animal impacts the species,\u201d Renata Emin, president of Bicho d\u2019Agua, told AP. \u201cThat\u2019s why any effort matters, not just because one individual may return to the wild and help rebuild the population but because of the community and government engagement it inspires.\u201d",

      "The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution cited the \u201cextremist character\u201d of the party, known as AfD, and said it \u201cdisregards human dignity\u201d \u2014 in particular by taking aim at those who moved to Germany from mostly Muslim countries.",
      "\u201cAs of today ... (the agency) has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a confirmed right-wing extremist effort due to the extremist character of the entire party that disregards human dignity,\u2032 it said.",

      "\u201cThe ethnic and descent-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic basic order,\u201d the intelligence service said, adding that the party's political positions have underpinned \u201ccontinuous agitation\u201d against minorities and stirred fear and hostility toward them.",

      "Under the move, any surveillance of AfD activities must abide by a \u201cprinciple of proportionality\u201d under German law.",

      "As Europe marks Victory Day over Nazi Germany, Londoner John Goldsmith still remembers the rationing, the blackouts and the bombs that devastated his neighborhood in east London",
      "LONDON -- John Goldsmith was too young to fight in World War II, but he remembers the rationing, the blackouts and the bombs that devastated his neighborhood in east London. And he remembers the party when peace returned to Europe.",
      "Church bells rang across the city, bonfires were lit and conga lines snaked through Piccadilly Circus as people filled the streets to celebrate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. For a 14-year-old boy, May 8, 1945, also brought something else: an end to the tedium of wartime rules and restrictions.",
      "\u201cWell, it was such a contrast. Suddenly, freedom! Mucking about. Doing all sorts of things that were frowned upon as not being the right thing to do,\u201d Goldsmith, now 94, said.",
      "\u201cBut now, for instance, all these wonderful pictures of Piccadilly and places like that. Buses covered with people standing on the roof just going barmy \u2014 not necessarily due to drink or anything of that nature. But definitely, they were letting their hair down,\u2019\u2019 he added with a giggle.",
      "Victory in Europe Day was a moment of relief for a city scarred by bombing raids and rocket attacks that killed an estimated 30,000 civilians throughout the war and didn\u2019t end until just a few weeks earlier. But it was also a time to look forward to the safe return of husbands, sons, brothers \u2014 and sisters \u2014 who were serving abroad, and to hope that lives put on hold in 1939 might soon return to normal.",
      "While D-Day was all about the troops who landed on the beaches of northern France to begin the liberation of Europe, V-E Day was a moment for the public, for everyone who sacrificed for the common good.",
      "Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who had inspired Britain during its darkest days, caught the mood of the nation when he announced the victory at 3 p.m. on May 8.",
      "\u201cMy dear friends, this is your hour,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not victory of a party or of any class. It\u2019s a victory of the great British nation as a whole.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a message Goldsmith wants people to remember before the World War II generation fades from the scene. A retired architect and amateur artist, he has long regaled his family with stories of his boyhood in the Bow neighborhood of east London. After a bit of prodding from his wife, Margaret, he recently began sketching the scenes so others could see what he lived through.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers, the airmen, the sailors can\u2019t operate without the people supporting them and backing them,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said. \u201cSo if we the people don\u2019t contribute, the armored elements will collapse. So it\u2019s so important that V-E Day should be \u2026 the people\u2019s day.\u2019\u2019",
      "While Londoners had been anticipating the end of the fighting in Europe for weeks, the announcement was like the cork popping out of a giant bottle of champagne in a city that had lived in the shadow of war for six years.",
      "Nowhere was the relief felt more deeply than in the East End, where thousands of homes, schools and businesses were reduced to rubble as Nazi bombers pounded docks and warehouses along the River Thames during the onslaught that became known as The Blitz. When Buckingham Palace was bombed on Sept. 13, 1940, Queen Elizabeth reportedly told a policeman she was glad, because \u201cit makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\u201d",
      "Goldsmith's drawings capture the day The Blitz began, with Nazi bombers filling the air and fires turning the night sky a molten volcanic red behind the docks. There's also the time a cricket match was suspended as one of the flying bombs known as \u201cdoodlebugs\u201d soared overhead, and the ghostly image of a rent collector emerging from a cloud of dust after a V-2 rocket, a type of long-range ballistic missile, obliterated a block of houses.",
      "The last V-2 to hit London destroyed an apartment building less than two miles from his home on March 27, 1945.",
      "Eighty years later, Goldsmith holds back tears when he remembers the moment he heard that the Nazis had surrendered.",
      "He and his friends were playing street soccer using a tennis ball \u2014 soccer balls being scarce after six years of war \u2014 when a young boy ran out of the nearby dairy and shouted simply, \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to be very careful now, because I could break up,\u2019\u2019 Goldsmith said, pausing to collect himself. \u201cBut that was the point when you realized: \u2018I didn\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "People had seen the end coming, but didn\u2019t dare to believe it could be true.",
      "In an era before television, Londoners flocked to the cinema to watch the weekly newsreels that charted the Allied advance toward Berlin. Goldsmith, who was just 8 when the war broke out, tracked the progress of the troops through the newspaper, carefully clipping the headlines and maps. By early 1945, he realized the surrender of the Third Reich was near.",
      "When the news finally came, it unleashed a wave of joy that lasted for days.",
      "Goldsmith remembers climbing the steps of St. John\u2019s Church in Bethnal Green to see over the crowds that lined the streets as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth drove through East London to celebrate with the locals.",
      "There were street parties and bonfires. Everyone contributed what they could with food still in short supply.",
      "\u201cThe favorite table from the lounge was brought out in the center of the street and linked with all the other personal possessions covered up with cloth and that sort of thing,\u201d Goldsmith remembered. \u201cFood was magicked from somewhere, and kids gorged themselves on all sorts of cakes.\u201d",
      "But the celebrations were bittersweet, tempered by the knowledge that V-E Day wasn't the end of the war.",
      "\u201cThere was a sudden realization. There was still the Japanese situation in the Far East,\" Goldsmith said. \"And people then buckled down.\u2019\u2019",

      "LONDON -- The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage won a seat in Parliament by a handful of votes and looked set to make more gains in results Friday from local elections the party hopes will show it is a major player in British politics.",
      "Reform's Sarah Pochin was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by six votes after a recount, defeating Labour candidate Karen Shore.",

      "\u201cWe are not a protest party, even though there is much to protest about,\" Farage told reporters at the election count.",
      "The local elections Thursday in many areas of England were a test of feeling about Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide. Both Labour and the main opposition Conservative Party braced for losses in the midterm poll.",
      "The Runcorn victory gives Reform, which got about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election, five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the country\u2019s main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029.",
      "Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns \u2014 a former Conservative lawmaker \u2014 was declared winner of the newly created mayoralty of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England. Labour retained three other mayoralties.",
      "Reform hopes to scoop up hundreds of municipal seats in the elections that are deciding 1,600 seats on 23 local councils, six mayoralties and one seat in Parliament. Ballots in most of those contests are being counted Friday.",
      "The centrist Liberal Democrats also hope to build on their success in winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives.",
      "A majority of the local seats being contested were held by the Conservatives, whose leader Kemi Badenoch could face revolt if the party does very badly.",
      "Badenoch acknowledged that the results could be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the Tories. The party did extremely well when these areas were last contested in 2021, a time when then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government enjoyed a surge in popularity due to the COVID-19 vaccine program.",
      "Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum.

      "\u201cConclave,\u201d the film may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 \u201cConclave,\u201d the movie, may have introduced movie-goers to the spectacular ritual and drama of a modern conclave, but the periodic voting to elect a new pope has been going on for centuries and created a whole genre of historical trivia.",
      "Here are some fun facts about conclaves past, derived from historical studies including Miles Pattenden's \u201cElecting the Pope in Early Modern Italy, 1450\u20131700\u201d and interviews with experts including Elena Cangiano, an archeologist at Viterbo's Palazzo dei Papi (Palace of the Popes).",
      "In the 13th century, it took almost three years \u2014 1,006 days to be exact \u2014 to choose Pope Clement IV's successor, making it the longest conclave in the Catholic Church\u2019s history. It's also where the term conclave comes from \u2014 \"under lock and key,\" because the cardinals who were meeting in Viterbo, north of Rome, took so long the town's frustrated citizens locked them in the room.",
      "The secret vote that elected Pope Gregory X lasted from November 1268 to September 1271. It was the first example of a papal election by \u201ccompromise,\u201d after a long struggle between supporters of two main geopolitical medieval factions \u2014 those faithful to the papacy and those supporting the Holy Roman Empire.",
      "Gregory X was elected only after Viterbo residents tore the roof off the building where the prelates were staying and restricted their meals to bread and water to pressure them to come to a conclusion. Hoping to avoid a repeat, Gregory X decreed in 1274 that cardinals would only get \u201cone meal a day\u201d if the conclave stretched beyond three days, and only \u201cbread, water and wine\u201d if it went beyond eight. That restriction has been dropped.",
      "Before 1274, there were times when a pope was elected the same day as the death of his predecessor. After that, however, the church decided to wait at least 10 days before the first vote. Later that was extended to 15 days to give all cardinals time to get to Rome. The quickest conclave observing the 10-day wait rule appears to have been the 1503 election of Pope Julius II, who was elected in just a few hours, according to Vatican historian Ambrogio Piazzoni. In more recent times, Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on the fifth ballot, Benedict XVI won in 2005 on the fourth and Pope Pius XII won on the third in 1939.",
      "The first conclave held under Michelangelo's frescoed ceiling in the Sistine Chapel was in 1492. Since 1878, the world-renowned chapel has become the venue of all conclaves. \u201cEverything is conducive to an awareness of the presence of God, in whose sight each person will one day be judged,\u201d St. John Paul II wrote in his 1996 document regulating the conclave, \u201cUniversi Dominici Gregis.\u201d The cardinals sleep a short distance away in the nearby Domus Santa Marta hotel or a nearby residence.",
      "Most conclaves were held in Rome, with some taking place outside the Vatican walls. Four were held in the Pauline Chapel of the papal residence at the Quirinale Palace, while some 30 others were held in St. John Lateran Basilica, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva or other places in Rome. On 15 occasions they took place outside Rome and the Vatican altogether, including in Viterbo, Perugia, Arezzo and Venice in Italy, and Konstanz, Germany and Lyon, France.",
      "Between 1378-1417, referred by historians to as the Western Schism, there were rival claimants to the title of pope. The schism produced multiple papal contenders, the so-called anti-popes, splitting the Catholic Church for nearly 40 years. The most prominent anti-popes during the Western Schism were Clement VII, Benedict XIII, Alexander V, and John XXIII. The schism was ultimately resolved by the Council of Constance in 1417, which led to the election of Martin V, a universally accepted pontiff.",
      "The cloistered nature of the conclave posed another challenge for cardinals: staying healthy. Before the Domus Santa Marta guest-house was built in 1996, cardinal electors slept on cots in rooms connected to the Sistine Chapel. Conclaves in the 16th and 17th centuries were described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cbadly smelling,\u201d with concern about disease outbreaks, particularly in summer, according to historian Miles Pattenden. \u201cThe cardinals simply had to have a more regular and comfortable way of living because they were old men, many of them with quite advanced disease,\u201d Pattenden wrote. The enclosed space and lack of ventilation further aggravated these issues. Some of the electors left the conclave sick, often seriously.",
      "Initially, papal elections weren\u2019t as secretive but concerns about political interference soared during the longest conclave in Viterbo. Gregory X decreed that cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion, \u201ccum clave\u201d (with a key), until a new pope was chosen. The purpose was to create a totally secluded environment where the cardinals could focus on their task, guided by God\u2019s will, without any political interference or distractions. Over the centuries, various popes have modified and reinforced the rules surrounding the conclave, emphasizing the importance of secrecy.",
      "Pope John XII was just 18 when he was elected in 955. The oldest popes were Pope Celestine III (elected in 1191) and Celestine V (elected in 1294) who were both nearly 85. Benedict XVI was 78 when he was elected in 2005.",
      "There is no requirement that a pope be a cardinal, but that has been the case for centuries. The last time a pope was elected who wasn\u2019t a cardinal was Urban VI in 1378. He was a monk and archbishop of Bari. While the Italians have had a stranglehold on the papacy over centuries, there have been many exceptions aside from John Paul II (Polish in 1978) and Benedict XVI (German in 2005) and Francis (Argentine in 2013). Alexander VI, elected in 1492, was Spanish; Gregory III, elected in 731, was Syrian; Adrian VI, elected in 1522, was from the Netherlands.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been on a campaign against Iran's nuclear program and his opposition helped convince President Trump to withdraw from an Obama era deal meant to rein it in",
      "JERUSALEM -- When the U.S. and Iran met for nuclear talks a decade ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against an emerging deal from the world\u2019s most public stages, including in a fiery speech to Congress seen as a direct challenge to the Obama administration as it was wrapping up the talks.",
      "Now, as the sides sit down to discuss a new deal, Netanyahu has fallen silent.",
      "Netanyahu sees an Iran with nuclear weapons as an existential threat to Israel, and he is just as wary of any new U.S. agreement with its archenemy that may not meet his standards. Yet he finds himself shackled with Donald Trump in the White House.",
      "Netanyahu is unwilling to publicly criticize a president who has shown broad support for Israel, whom he deems to be Israel's greatest friend, and who doesn't take well to criticism.",
      "He \u201ccan't do anything that goes against Trump. He's paralyzed,\u201d said Yoel Guzansky, an Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv-based think tank.",
      "Israel is in a position of power against Iran after a series of strategic achievements over the past 18 months in the wars that have shaken the Middle East. It thrashed Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and directly attacked Iran last year, neutralizing some of its key air defenses. Experts say Israel now has a window of opportunity for what could be an effective strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, with possibly less regional blowback.",
      "Yet Israel\u2019s leader was recently unable to galvanize Trump to prioritize a strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 which would likely hinge on U.S. military assistance to be successful. With the U.S. negotiating with Iran, Israel has little legitimacy to pursue a military option on its own.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu is trapped,\u201d said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \u201cHe was banking on Israel\u2019s position relative to Iran to improve under Trump. In practice, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu and his nationalist supporters hoped Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be advantageous because of his history of support for Israel. They thought that, under Trump, the U.S. might back a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "But Trump\u2019s approach to Iran \u2014 as well as on other issues, such as tariffs \u2014 has shown the relationship is more complicated, and that Trump\u2019s interests don\u2019t entirely align with Netanyahu\u2019s.",
      "Netanyahu has long accused Iran of developing a nuclear weapon and went on a global campaign against the Obama deal. He painted the nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel and the world, and said the agreement was too weak to contain it. Israel remains the Mideast's only nuclear-armed state, an advantage it would like to keep.",
      "With Netanyahu's strong encouragement, Trump backed out of the deal struck by Obama. And since returning to the White House, Trump has given Israel free rein in its war against Hamas in Gaza, been soft on the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory and launched strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked Israel since the start of the war.",
      "But now that the U.S. has returned to the negotiating table with Iran, Netanyahu would risk jeopardizing his good ties with the president if he were to publicly oppose one of his administration\u2019s key foreign policy initiatives.",
      "The last time Netanyahu crossed the temperamental Trump was when he congratulated Joe Biden for his election win in 2020. Trump was apparently offended by the perceived disloyalty, and their ties went into deep freeze.",
      "Israel is communicating to Washington its priorities for any deal. As part of that, it understood that should Israel choose to carry out a strike on Iran, it would likely be doing so alone \u2014 so long as negotiations were underway, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.",
      "In a speech in Jerusalem this week, Netanyahu said he had discussed his terms for a deal with Trump. He explained that it would need to dismantle all the infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program and that it should work to prevent Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering a bomb.",
      "\"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do. We\u2019re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other \u2013 Iran will not have nuclear weapons,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu has said he would favor a strict diplomatic agreement similar to Libya\u2019s deal in 2003 to destroy its nuclear facilities and allow inspectors unfettered access. However, it is not clear if Trump will set such strict conditions \u2014 and Iran has rejected giving up its right to enrich.",
      "The Trump-led talks with Iran began earlier this month and have advanced to expert discussions over how to rein in Iran's nuclear program and prevent it from being able to obtain atomic weapons, should it choose to pursue them. Iran says its program is for peaceful purposes, though some officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb.",
      "While Trump has said a military option remains on the table, and has moved military assets to the region, he says he prefers a diplomatic solution. Planned talks between Iran and the United States this weekend were postponed on Thursday.",
      "Since Trump scrapped the Obama-era agreement in 2018, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment and increased its uranium stockpile.",
      "Netanyahu's 2015 speech to Congress against Obama's deal \u2014 at the invitation of Republicans \u2014 was made without consulting the White House. Obama did not attend.",
      "That was just one of many instances in which Netanyahu was seen as cozying up to Republicans, driving a wedge in what has traditionally been bipartisan support for Israel. That, coupled with Netanyahu's strained relationship with the Biden administration over Israel's conduct in Gaza, has meant that Netanyahu can't rely on Democratic allies to take up his cause.",
      "Still, Netanyahu would struggle to find any Republicans willing to publicly confront the president on this issue. And he himself will struggle to criticize a deal if one is clinched; instead, he might send surrogates like his far-right allies to do so, said Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University.",
      "But until then, Gilboa said, Netanyahu's best hope is that the talks fail.",
      "\u201cThat, for him, will be the best case scenario.\u201d",

      "Han\u2019s entry heats up the scramble among conservatives to unify behind a candidate to compete with liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung, whose campaign recently was set back by a court decision to open a new trial on election law violation charges.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve determined to find what I can do for the future of the Republic of Korea that I love and for all of us. I\u2019ll try my utmost to be chosen by the people at this presidential election,\" Han told a press conference at the National Assembly.",
      "South Korea is holding an early presidential election on June 3 after conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was ousted over his imposition of martial law. Han was appointed prime minister, the No. 2 post, by Yoon, and he served as acting leader after Yoon was suspended and later removed from office.",
      "Han also was prime minister under liberal President Roh Moo-hyun from 2007 to 2008 and has served as trade minister, finance minister and ambassador to the U.S. during his 40-year career in public service. He has never held elected office but has risen politically as the main conservative People Power Party struggles in the wake of Yoon\u2019s ouster.",
      "Han does not belong to a political party, but contenders in the PPP have said they are willing to field a single candidate among them and Han. PPP members are scheduled to nominate their party's candidate Saturday.",
      "Han said that if elected, he would launch a body to amend the constitution so the president and the assembly share powers based on the principle of checks and balances. His revisions would also bar the political circle and the judiciary branch from meddling in each other's sectors.",
      "In South Korea, executive power is heavily concentrated on a president, and there have been calls for change.",
      "The election June 3 will give the new president a full, single five-year term. But Han said he would serve three years to finish the constitutional revision and then leave.",
      "Han said he would also use his expertise on economic affairs to resolve trade issues with the U.S. over President Donald Trump's tariff policies.",
      "Lee's main liberal opposition Democratic Party stepped up its offensive against Han, saying he is abandoning his duties as the government's caretaker and lacks the moral standing to run for the presidency as a No. 2 official in the Yoon administration, responsible for many policy failures.",
      "\u201cWe warn to former Prime Minister Han. Don't hide your greed with a lie that you are running for the people,\u201d party spokesperson Noh Jongmyun said.",

    "story": [
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro is pressing on his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Thursday pressed on with his struggling plan to overhaul the country\u2019s labor laws, sending Congress a referendum proposal whose questions for voters include whether workdays should be limited to eight hours and whether workers should receive double pay if they work during holidays.",
      "With much of his agenda repeatedly blocked by Congress, Petro is now betting that the same lawmakers who twice rejected his labor reform will allow voters to decide whether they want his proposed changes. Congress has one month to approve or reject the 12-question referendum.",
      "Petro, Colombia\u2019s first ever leftist president, sought to rally support for his project by participating in a union demonstration in the capital, Bogota, marking Labor Day.",
      "\u201cThe people of Colombia want to vote for their fundamental rights, for their dignity,\" Petro said before thousands of demonstrators, asking them to not vote to reelect any lawmaker who votes against the referendum.",
      "If approved by lawmakers, Petro will have to issue a decree summoning Colombians to the polls within three months. Questions for voters would include whether daytime workdays should end at 6 p.m. and whether open-ended contracts should be offered to workers to prioritize job stability.",
      "But overcoming Congress is not Petro\u2019s only concern in seeing his project become a reality. He needs referendum participation to exceed 13 million \u2013 that\u2019s more than the number of votes he obtained to become president \u2013 and more than half of those votes must be in favor of his proposal.",
      "Analysts agree that Petro has the upper hand in several scenarios, even if Congress does not approve the referendum or if he fails to obtain the necessary votes at the polls. In the former scenario, Sandra Borda, political science professor at the University of the Andes, said lawmakers would give Petro\u2019s government the tools to \u201cplay the victim\u201d and strengthen its rhetoric against Congress.",
      "\u201cThe message the government has constantly tried to send is that Congress is no longer an entity that represents the interests of the people... but rather defends the interests, as they call them, of the private sector oligarchies,\u201d Borda said.",
      "On the other hand, if voters end up going to the polls, the government could consider itself the winner by securing support from its electoral base, said Javier Garay, a political science professor at the Externship University of Colombia. He noted that the referendum\u2019s underlying purpose is to test the government\u2019s electoral support ahead of the 2026 presidential election.",
      "Union members who were among the thousands of people demonstrating Thursday in Bogota expressed support for the referendum.",
      "\u201cThe referendum is a vindication of workers\u2019 rights, which have been a struggle for decades and were taken away from us by previous far-right governments,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Parra, 53, one of the protesters.",

      "Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Sister Inah Canabarro, a Brazilian nun and teacher who was the world's oldest person, died on Wednesday just weeks short of turning 117, her religious congregation said.",
      "Canabarro died at home of natural causes, said her Teresian nun congregation, the Company of Saint Teresa of Jesus. She was confirmed in January as the world\u2019s oldest person by LongeviQuest, an organization that tracks supercentenarians around the globe.",
      "She would have turned 117 on May 27. According to LongeviQuest, the world\u2019s oldest person is now Ethel Caterham, a 115-year-old British woman.",
      "Canabarro said her Catholic faith was the key to her longevity, in a video taken by LongeviQuest in February 2024. The smiling Canabarro can be seen cracking jokes, sharing miniature paintings she used to make of wild flowers and reciting the Hail Mary prayer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m young, pretty and friendly \u2014 all very good, positive qualities that you have too,\u201d the Teresian nun told the visitors to her retirement home in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.",
      "As a child, Sister Inah Canabarro was so skinny that many people didn\u2019t think she would survive into adulthood, Cleber Canabarro, her 84-year-old nephew, told The Associated Press in January,",
      "Her great-grandfather was a famed Brazilian general who took up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil\u2019s independence from Portugal in the 19th century.",
      "She took up religious work while she was a teenager and spent two years in Montevideo, Uruguay, before moving to Rio de Janeiro and eventually settling in her home state of Rio Grande do Sul. A lifelong teacher, among her former students was Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the last of the military dictators who governed Brazil between 1964 and 1985. She was also the beloved creator of two marching bands at schools in sister cities straddling the border between Uruguay and Brazil.",
      "For her 110th birthday, she was honored by Pope Francis. She was the second oldest nun ever documented, after Lucile Randon, who was the world\u2019s oldest person until her death in 2023 at the age of 118.",
      "Canabarro took the title of the oldest living person following the death of Japan\u2019s Tomiko Itooka in December, according to LongeviQuest. She ranked as the 20th oldest documented person to have ever lived, a list topped by Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, according to LongeviQuest.",
      "\u201cHer long and meaningful life touched many, and her legacy as a devoted educator, religious sister, and a supercentenarian will be remembered with great admiration,\u201d LongeviQuest said in a statement.",
      "The wake for Canabarro will take place on Thursday in Porto Alegre, the capital of southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, her order said.",

      "President Donald Trump is threatening sanctions on anyone who buys Iranian oil",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened sanctions on anyone who buys Iranian oil, a warning that came after planned talks over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program were postponed.",
      "Trump wrote on social media, \u201cAll purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!\u201d He said any country or person who buys those products from Iran will not be able to do business with the United States \u201cin any way, shape, or form.\u201d",
      "It was unclear how Trump would implement such a ban as he threatened to levy secondary sanctions on nations that import Iranian oil. But his statement risked further escalating tensions with China \u2014 Iran\u2019s leading customer \u2014 at a time when the relationship is severely strained over the U.S. president\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Based on tanker tracking data, the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded in a report published last October that \u201cChina took nearly 90% of Iran\u2019s crude oil and condensate exports in 2023.\u201d Trump has separately placed 145% tariffs on China as a way to raise federal revenues and rebalance global trade.",
      "Trump's social media threat came after Oman announced planned nuclear negotiations for this coming weekend had been postponed. Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi made the announcement in a post on the social platform X.",
      "\u201cFor logistical reasons we are rescheduling the US Iran meeting provisionally planned for Saturday May 3rd,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNew dates will be announced when mutually agreed.\u201d",
      "Al-Busaidi, who has mediated the talks through three rounds so far, did not elaborate.",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also blamed \u201clogistical and technical reasons\u201d for the postponement.",
      "\u201cOn Iran\u2019s part, there is no change in our determination to secure a negotiated solution,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cWe are more determined than ever to achieve a just and balanced deal: guaranteeing an end to sanctions, and creating confidence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program will forever remain peaceful while ensuring that Iranian rights are fully respected.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a person familiar with the U.S. negotiators said America \u201chad never confirmed its participation\u201d in a fourth round of talks in Rome. However, the person said the U.S. expected the talks to occur \u201cin the near future.\u201d The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "Rome will see the Vatican begin its conclave next week to pick a new pope after the death of Pope Francis. Two other rounds of U.S.-Iran talks have been held in Muscat, the capital of Oman.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on a half-century of enmity. The negotiations have been led by Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "The U.S. president with his threat on social media would be going after Iran's major economic resource. It produced an average of 2.9 million barrels a day in 2023 of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran\u2019s program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. continues an airstrike campaign, called \u201cOperation Rough Rider,\u201d that has been targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels, who long have been backed by Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth early Thursday warned Iran over the rebels.",
      "\u201cMessage to IRAN: We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of \u2014 and you were warned. You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing.\u201d",
      "Last Saturday's round of talks, which included experts drilling down into the details of a possible deal, also took place as an explosion rocked an Iranian port, killing at least 70 people and injuring more than 1,000 others.",

      "Hundreds of dogs and their owners gathered at the Budapest City Park and walked in a long, noisy loop in the spring sun. The parade of pups was under the observation of the Hungarian Records Association, which was tasked with determining whether the canine cavalcade could be officially entered into the record books.",
      "Istv\u00e1n Sebesty\u00e9n, registrar and president of the association, said his organization would carefully tally the number of participating dogs \u2014 a challenge, he said, when so many hounds and humans were gathered in one place.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t usually take dachshunds on walks in droves, so this experiment has to correspond to our system of rules,\u201d he said.",
      "Dachshunds, a short, muscular breed with stubby legs, were first bred in Germany, and remain one of Hungary's most popular dog breeds.",
      "Also known as \u201cwiener dogs\u201d or \u201csausage dogs\u201d for their long, low-slung bodies, they were initially bred for hunting badgers and other burrowing creatures. But their loyal, curious and playful nature has also made them popular as family pets.",
      "In Munich, Germany in 1972, a rainbow-colored dachshund named Waldi became the first official mascot in the history of the Olympic Summer Games.",
      "Last September, the German city of Regensburg set the current world record for the largest dachshund dog walk as hundreds of the breed paraded through the medieval town center.",
      "While some counts from Regensburg put the number of dogs at 1,175, Guinness World Records could only confirm 897.",
      "On Thursday, Lili Horv\u00e1th and her 1-year-old dachshund Zabos participated in the walk in Budapest. She said her furry friend \"has very deeply human qualities and is very loyal, he\u2019s really a love bomb.\u201d",
      "Valeria F\u00e1bi\u00e1n, who was walking her dachshund Zsebi, saw it differently.",
      "\u201cFew people are capable of giving this kind of selflessness, because people don\u2019t have as much love and self-sacrifice as a dog can give a human,\u201d she said.",
      "By the end of the record-seeking walk, the Hungarian Records Association determined that 500 dachshunds had been present \u2014 enough to set a Hungarian record, but still short of the Guinness mark set in Regensburg.",
      "Organizers, undeterred, vowed to try again next year \u2014 giving them plenty of time to muster more mutts for another shot at the title.",

      "Workers' unions joined university students in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, to demand changes in labor and strike laws as part of Labor Day protests. In the northern city of Novi Sad, residents left flowers and lit candles outside the central station where tons of concrete crashed on the people standing or sitting underneath on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia blamed alleged rampant government corruption fueling negligence and disrespect of safety regulations for the tragedy. The concrete canopy at the outer wall of the building had been renovated twice before the disaster as part of a major infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "Almost daily protests since the crash have developed into a nationwide movement demanding changes.",
      "Thousands marched in Novi Sad on Thursday after holding a commemorative silence for the victims near the station. University students, a key force behind the anti-graft movement, set up a stone monument with an inscription saying: \"Novi Sad remembers.\"",
      "\u201cToday, we declared the train station building for a memorial site,\u201d a student told the crowd. \u201cIt will serve as a reminder what happens when corruption takes over the state.\u201d",

      "\u201cCorruption kills!\u201d said one student, who did not say his name. \u201cThis is why the fight against corruption must be held not only at (student) blockades but also at work place.\u201d",
      "Populist supporters of President Vucic meanwhile enjoyed a May Day barbecue, drinks and folk music in a pro-government camp outside the parliament building and in an adjacent park by the presidential palace. The guarded camp, set up weeks ago, also hosted masked ex-paramilitary fighters apparently as protection for Vucic.",
      "Vucic has accused the anti-graft protesters of staging a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d under Western instructions to oust him from power and \u201cdestroy\u201d Serbia. He has organized parallel rallies to counter almost daily street demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands of people for some of the biggest ever anti-government rallies in the country.",

In the latest incident on Monday in Novi Sad, police used batons and pepper spray while pushing protesters away from a sports faculty building. Several people were injured.",

      "The White House plans to unveil President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget, his first since returning to power",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning on Friday to unveil President Donald Trump's 2026 budget, a sweeping framework that is expected to propose steep reductions, if not a wholesale zeroing out, of various federal programs as part of his administration's priorities.",
      "Budgets do not become law but serve as a touchstone for the upcoming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trump's return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican president's second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025, confirmed Friday's planned release. It is expected to be the so-called \u201cskinny\u201d version of topline numbers, with more details to come.",
      "\u201cDetails soon,\u201d Vought said during a Cabinet meeting this week at the White House.",
      "The nation's estimated $7 trillion-plus federal budget has been growing steadily, with annual deficits fast approaching $2 trillion and the annual interest on the debt almost $1 trillion. That's thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code and climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover the nation's health needs as people age. The nation's debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning.",
      "This year's presidential budget request is expected to show deep reductions in spending, some reflective of the cuts already made by Trump's actions and adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including the slashing of the government workforce. It also could point to potential new revenue streams, possibly from Trump's tariffs program.",
      "Democrats are prepared to lambast Trump's budget as further evidence that the Republican administration is intent on gutting government programs that Americans depend on.",
      "It comes as Congress is already deep into the slog of drafting of Trump's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered funds for the administration's mass deportation effort \u2014 a package that, unlike the budget, would actually carry the force of law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who spoke with Trump multiple times this week, is racing to have the president's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d approved by the House by Memorial Day and sent on to the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of \u2018The One, Big Beautiful Bill!\u2019 are coming together very well,\" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement after Thursday's meeting with Trump and various committee chairmen.",
      "But there remain deep differences among the Republicans, who are trying to pass that big bill over the objections of Democrats.",
      "\"We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Meantime, Cabinet officials are expected to start making the trek to Capitol Hill to testify about their various requests in the president's budget.",
      "It's Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns.",
      "Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case to Congress for funds.",
      "Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government.",
      "Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR.",
      "Vought has said that package of so-called budget rescissions would be a first of potentially more, as the Trump administration tests the appetite in Congress for lawmakers to go on record and vote to roll back the money.",

In 2023, the watchdog fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.",
      "The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address \u201cpotential access by Chinese authorities\u201d to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as \u2018materially diverging\u2019 from EU standards.\u201d",
      "Grahn said TikTok has \u201chas never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.\u201d",
      "Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.",
      "The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved \u201cremote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.\u201d",
      "TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.",
      "Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments \u201cvery seriously\" and \u201cconsidering what further regulatory action may be warranted.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be \u201ca card on the table\u201d in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday.",
      "\u201cIt does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,\u201d Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo.",
      "Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports from Japan.",
      "Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option.",
      "Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys.",
      "Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan.",
      "Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products.",
      "A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs.",
      "The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening.",
      "Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures.",
      "But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate.",
      "U.S. government bonds are traditionally viewed as a safe financial asset, and recent spikes in yields of those bonds have raised worries that they might be losing that status due to Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",

      "The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage has won a seat in Parliament and hundreds of council in local elections across England",
      "LONDON -- The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage snatched a seat in Parliament from the governing Labour Party and won hundreds of local council seats from the opposition Conservatives in elections that Farage hailed Friday as a turning point towards ending the two parties' poltiical dominance.",
      "Reform's Sarah Pochin was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by six votes after a recount, defeating Labour candidate Karen Shore by the narrowest of margins.",
      "It was a significant defeat for Labour, which easily won the district in last year's national election. The special election was held because Labour lawmaker Mike Amesbury was forced to quit after he was convicted of punching a constituent in a drunken rage.",
      "Farage said that \u201cit\u2019s a very, very big moment indeed\u201d that shows Reform can win against both Labour and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives.",
      "\u201cThis marks the end of two-party politics as we\u2019ve known it for over a century,\u201d he said.",
      "The Runcorn victory gives Reform, which garnered about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election, five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 403 for Labour and 121 for the Conservatives.",
      "But Reform appears to have momentum. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the country\u2019s main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029.",
      "The local elections held Thursday in many areas of England were a sobering rebuff to Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide.",
      "Farage\u2019s party is targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmer\u2019s popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy. The government has raised the minimum wage, strengthened workers\u2019 rights and pumped money into the state-funded health system \u2014 but also hiked employer\u2019 taxes and cut welfare benefits.",
      "Starmer said that he understood why many voters are discontented.",
      "\u201cMy response is: We get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.\u201d",
      "The results were an even bigger blow to the Conservatives, whose voters switched to Reform in droves.",
      "Reform, which didn't exist when these areas last voted four years ago, won hundreds of municipal seats in the elections for six mayoralties and the control of 23 local councils, mostly at the Tories' expense.",
      "Reform won control of several county-level local authorities, including previous Conservative strongolds Staffordshire and Lincolnshire in central England, Durham in the north and Farage's home county of Kent in the southeast.",
      "Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative lawmaker, won the newly created mayoralty of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England. Labour retained three other mayoralties and the Conservatives won one.",
      "The victories will bring pressure for Reform to deliver on transport, garbage collection, potholes and all the other unglamorous demands of everyday politics.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who could now face a party revolt, posted on X that she was \u201cdetermined to win back the trust of the public and the seats we\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "The results give only a partial snapshot of voter sentiment. Many areas, including London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, didn't hold elections. Turnout for local polls is typically much lower than in a national election.",
      "And Reform isn't the only story. The centrist Liberal Democrats made gains by winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives.",
      "Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A charismatic campaigner, he is a divisive figure who has said that many migrants come to the U.K. from cultures \u201calien to ours.\u201d",
      "Reform blends Farage\u2019s long-standing political themes \u2014 strong borders, curbing immigration \u2014 with policies reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. During the campaign Farage said that he plans \u201ca DOGE for every county\u201d in England, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s contentious spending-slashing agency.",
      "University of Strathclyde political scientist John Curtice said that the results showed that politics in Britain, long dominated by the two big parties, has fragmented.",
      "\u201cReform are now posing a big threat to both Conservative and Labour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "As to whether two-party dominance will continue, \u201cthe question mark on that has just got three or four times bigger,\u201d Curtice said.",

      "In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, construction workers recently began placing wooden beams to frame a house on a lot where only a charred fireplace remains standing. In the seaside city of Malibu and foothills neighborhood of Altadena, many land parcels where homes once stood are being cleared of debris.",

      "Some 17,000 homes, businesses and other structures burned to the ground in the Jan. 7 fires. It's uncertain how much will be rebuilt.",
      "Many homeowners will not be able to afford it, even those with insurance. Some are still trying to figure out whether it\u2019s safe to return to their properties, given limited data on the degree to which toxins from the fires, including lead and asbestos, may have permeated their land. Roughly 400 land parcels are already for sale in the fire-ravaged areas.",
      "Facing overwhelming loss and the chaos that comes with sudden displacement, those looking to rebuild must navigate an often confusing and time-consuming process. In most cases, it will take years for them to rebuild.",
      "LA issued its first building permit nearly two months after the fires started. It took more than seven months before the first building permit was issued following the Woolsey Fire in 2018.",
      "\u201cPutting this in context of other disasters, the speed is actually probably faster than expected,\u201d said Sara McTarnaghan, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studied the aftermath of urban wildfires in recent years in Colorado, Hawaii and California.",
      "Kathryn Frazier, a music publicist and life coach, had lived in her four-bedroom, three-bath house in Altadena for 10 years and raised her two children there. After her home burned to the ground, she was in shock and questioned whether it made sense to come back.",

      "She is making progress. Frazier hired a crew to clear the property of debris and she is nearly through the first phase of permitting, which involves getting county review and approval for her new home's design. The next phase before receiving approval to begin construction includes reviews of electrical, plumbing and other aspects of the design.",

      "\u201cWe are hoping to be building by June or July, latest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that maybe by February or March of 2026 we could be back in our home.\"",
      "For now, Frazier is getting quotes on windows, skylights and other home fixtures in hopes of locking in prices before they go up as more construction projects ramp up, or in response to the Trump administration's ongoing trade war.",

      "The couple, who have two daughters, have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. They couldn\u2019t imagine giving up and not rebuilding.",
      "\u201cNot only are we building another house, we\u2019re building the exact same house again,\u201d Heline said, noting the new home will have some upgrades including fire-resistant materials and sprinklers for the exterior of the house.",
      "Recently, they cleared debris from the land where the house once stood, a particularly onerous task because the home featured a large basement into which much of the structure collapsed as it burned.",
      "Heline isn't sure when construction will begin, but figures it could be two or three years. She wonders, however, what the neighborhood will look like by then.",
      "\u201cWhat are you going back to? You\u2019re going back to a moonscape? Are you there and no one else is on your block, or are you going back to a construction zone for many more years?\" she said.",

Of the roughly two dozen clients that the group is serving, at reduced cost, three are in the early stages of the permitting process.",

      "Rock-bottom mortgage rates turbocharged the housing market during the pandemic, fueling bidding wars for homes that pushed up sale prices sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars above a seller initial asking price. U.S. home prices soared more than 50% between 2019 and 2024.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. In March, they posted their largest monthly drop since November 2022.",
      "It's not all bad news for prospective homebuyers.",
      "Home prices are rising much more slowly than during the pandemic housing market frenzy. The national median sales price of a previously occupied U.S. home rose 2.7% in March from a year earlier to $403,700, an all-time high for March, but the smallest annual increase since August.",
      "In April, the median price of a home listed for sale rose only 0.3% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Buyers who can afford current mortgage rates have a wider selection of properties now than a year ago.",
      "Active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 surged 30.6% last month from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. Home listings jumped between 67.6% and 70.1% in San Diego, San Jose and Washington D.C.",
      "As properties take longer to sell, more sellers are reducing their asking price. Some 18% of listings had their price reduced last month, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cSellers are becoming more flexible on pricing, underscored by the price reductions we\u2019re seeing, and while higher mortgage rates are certainly weighing on demand, the silver lining is that the market is starting to rebalance,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \"This could create opportunities for buyers who are prepared.\u201d",

    "summary": "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "\u201cThe passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of California\u2019s unworkable mandates,\u201d House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cIf not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid.\u201d",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "This week's House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March.",
      "Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans' ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change.",
      "\u201cClean air didn\u2019t used to be political,\" Newsom said in a statement. \u201cOur vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we\u2019ll continue defending it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency \u201cwill continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAO\u2019s findings that California\u2019s Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiff's office.",
      "\u201cWe will fight this latest attack on California\u2019s power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states\u2019 rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress\u2019 trusted arbiters,\" the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a \u201cbackdoor move\u201d that \u201cshows just how recklessly Republicans behave.\u201d",
      "\"Republicans may regret opening this Pandora\u2019s box, inviting attacks on many other non-rules in the future when they\u2019re no longer in charge,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "But the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers applauded Thursday's vote, calling it a \u201chuge win for U.S. consumers.\"",
      "\"California\u2019s unlawful ban should never have been authorized, and Governor Newsom should never have been allowed to seize this much control over the American vehicle market,\u201d Mike Sommers, the institute's president and CEO, and Chet Thompson, the manufacturers group's president and CEO, said in a joint statement.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- State parks would be protected from pickleball courts, golf courses and hotel development under a bill passed unanimously by the Florida House on Thursday in response to last summer's statewide outcry over plans for these kinds of projects.",
      "The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasn't said if he'll sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.",
      "The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governor\u2019s administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis' record on environmental conservation.",
      "Protections for state parks are reflected \u201cloud and clear\u201d in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved,\u201d said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike.",
      "The bill doesn\u2019t ban all types of development. But any projects must be \u201cconservation-based recreational uses\u201d that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis.",
      "Snyder said the bill's language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee.",
      "The public first got wind that DeSantis' environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the state's environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like \u201cParks Over Profit\u201d and \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave.\u201d",
      "Before the month was over, the governor said the Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s plans were \u201cgoing back to the drawing board.\u201d",
      "The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

      "Eli Lilly's stock wobbled Thursday after a looming coverage hit was detailed for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound.",
      "CVS Health said the drugs Wegovy and Saxenda from rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk will become the preferred options on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "This could complicate access to a drug that many patients cannot afford to pay for on their own.",
      "The formulary is maintained by CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefits management business, which runs prescription drug coverage for millions of people. Employers and insurers \u2014 who pay most of the prescription bill \u2014 use the formulary to decide which drugs get coverage.",
      "They can customize their coverage plans to include Zepbound. But CVS Health spokesman David Whitrap said most employers wind up using the standard formulary because of the discounts negotiated for them.",
      "Patients taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy if the Lilly drug is excluded from their coverage, Whitrap said.",
      "CVS Health also said Thursday that it will start selling Wegovy at a discounted price of about $500 monthly at thousands of drugstores for people without coverage. Novo had announced its new lower price last month.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. Coverage of these drugs has been patchy due to in part to their cost and the wide swath of patients who could take them.",
      "Shortages of the drugs also have made access challenging, but those have eased recently. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to pit the products against each other to negotiate lower prices in exchange for inclusion on a formulary.",
      "Lilly may have to make some price cuts to restore formulary access, said Daniel Barasa, who follows the company for Gabelli Funds. But he said he thinks big employers will still include both treatments on their lists of covered drugs, leaving the choice on what to use up to patients and doctors.",
      "Lilly said late last year that a head-to-head study of the two drugs showed that Zepbound helped patients drop more pounds.",
      "Zepbound has emerged as one of Lilly's top sellers. Its sales jumped to $2.3 billion in the recently completed first quarter. That\u2019s up from $517 million a year ago, during the drug\u2019s first full quarter on the market.",
      "Lilly shares shed more than $90 in value, falling nearly 11% to $804.06 Thursday afternoon. Broader indexes, meanwhile, rose slightly.",

      "Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed \u201cif you think I\u2019m good, wait until you see my little brother.\u201d",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Kyle Busch was hyped for NASCAR greatness long before he was a teenager by his Hall of Fame nominee brother, who vowed \u201cif you think I\u2019m good, wait until you see my little brother.\u201d",
      "Busch's debut in a NASCAR national series race was delayed, though, when he turned up at California Speedway in 2001 intent to run the Truck Series race. He dominated practice in a race sponsored by Marlboro but, because he was only 16 at the time, was ruled ineligible to compete over NASCAR's interpretation of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.",
      "The MSA prohibited individuals under 18 from participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. And because NASCAR at the time was sponsored by Winston, the series eventually adopted its own rule six weeks later implementing a minimum age requirement of 18 that began in 2002.",
      "Busch had no choice but to move to the American Speed Association National Tour, and then ARCA after graduating early from his Las Vegas high school.",
      "Fast-forward to Friday when Busch celebrates his 40th birthday as a two-time Cup Series champion headed to Texas Motor Speedway with 232 national series victories. Kurt Busch, his older brother by seven years and a nominee last week to next year's Hall of Fame class, has one Cup title and 43 career national series victories.",
      "Busch can now laugh at his experience 24 years ago at California Speedway, where he went on to win five Cup races, including the last one in 2023 before the track was shuttered by NASCAR.",
      "\u201cShut that place down,\u201d he said, noting the irony that he's now sponsored by zone nicotine pouches, which has an additional relationship with online retailer Nicokick. \u201cFull circle moment.\u201d",
      "Busch celebrated his birthday early \u2014 over the Easter weekend, which was NASCAR's only break of the 38-race schedule \u2014 with a vacation with wife, Samantha. They left their two children home and Samantha made a heartfelt social media post honoring her husband.",
      "\u201cEarly celebration for Kyle\u2019s big 4-0, love ya babe,\u201d Samantha wrote, sharing a picture of herself and her husband at dinner on a beachfront. In a separate image, Kyle could also be seen with a small chocolate cake in front of him with a candle burning.",
      "Busch said he and Samantha \u201cmade the most of it\u201d even though he finds it difficult to unwind.",
      "\u201cJust a nice little quiet time, tried to disconnect, that's not easy for me to do,\u201d Busch said. \u201cSo I'm still kind of doing some work from afar, emails and things like that.\u201d",
      "And as for turning 40? Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled. Busch is in his 23rd season in the Cup Series, and although he joined Richard Childress Racing in 2023 and won three races, he went winless in Cup last year for the first time in his career and missed the playoffs. His losing streak headed to Texas is an eye-popping 67 races.",
      "\u201cI remember turning 30 and thinking that was going to be it,\u201d Busch said. \u201cIt is what it is. Samantha has made the best of that for me where we celebrated my birthday on that trip. I don't feel much older than I did five, six years ago. So that's the good part of it. And I'm in pretty decent shape, so thankful for all of that.\u201d",
      "Busch briefly considered retirement at the end of the 2022 season when he parted ways with Joe Gibbs Racing, where he for now is the winningest driver in team history with Denny Hamlin closing in on his mark. Now, he'd like to race at least until his son, Brexton, turns 18 and the two can compete against each other in NASCAR.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- With his team trailing by 27 points to the red-hot Houston Rockets at halftime, coach Steve Kerr pulled Golden State emotional leader Draymond Green aside for a quick chat and to ask his opinion.",
      "Should the Warriors plan to save their starters for what looked like an inevitable Game 6 in two days if things became any more out of hand after intermission? Green suggested Kerr should give the group five more minutes to see what could be done on the deficit.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer to that,\u201d James said Wednesday night when asked how long he will continue to play. \u201cSomething I\u2019ll sit down with my wife and my support group and kind of just talk through it, and see what happens. Just have conversations with myself on how long I want to continue to play. I don\u2019t know the answer to that right now, to be honest.\u201d",

      "Most observers think the four-time champion is planning to return for a 23rd season, which would break the NBA longevity record he currently shares with Vince Carter. He is also just 49 regular-season games behind Robert Parish, who holds the NBA record with 1,611 games played. James already holds the league record for career playoff games with 292.",

      "James and Doncic played only 21 games together after the deal, and it wasn't enough to maximize their potential teamwork. Another full year together could raise their partnership to formidable levels, and James still seems intrigued by the prospect of playing a full year or more alongside the Slovenian superstar he has described as his favorite active player.",
      "\u201cAnytime you make a big acquisition in the middle of the season, it\u2019s always going to be challenging, not only for me, but for (Austin Reaves) and the rest of the group,\u201d James said. \u201cThere were times where we obviously didn\u2019t look so well, but I think we kind of figured it out later in the season, the more games we had. I still don\u2019t think we had enough time to mesh, but for the time that we had, I thought we ended the regular season very well to be top three in the West.\u201d",
      "Doncic isn't the only teammate who could compel James to return: His 20-year-old son, Bronny, is coming off a surprisingly solid rookie season with the Lakers in which they became the first father and son to play together in NBA history.",
      "Bronny James is hoping to carve out a bigger role alongside his father next season after getting sporadic playing time this year. LeBron said the chance to work alongside Bronny this season was the \u201cNo. 1\u201d accomplishment of his career.",
      "There are no apparent contractual or financial issues in James' way: He has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. That\u2019s serious money to leave on the table, even for a business mogul with a net worth estimated at more than $1 billion.",
      "An eighth consecutive season with the Lakers would be the longest stretch of his career with one team, surpassing his first seven seasons with Cleveland \u2014 although he returned for four more years and a championship with the Cavaliers.",
      "James' level of play remained high in his 22nd season, confounding all previous notions of basketball longevity. He averaged 24.4 points per game \u2014 his lowest since his rookie season, but just barely \u2014 along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds.",
      "James remained the Lakers' heart while they won 52 games and the Pacific Division title despite the midseason roster upheaval. Every significant contributor on this season's roster is under contract for 2025-26 except for Dorian Finney-Smith, who has a $15.3 million player option, and inconsistent center Jaxson Hayes.",
      "In a moment of reflection near his 40th birthday last December, James speculated that he could continue to play at this level for five to seven more years. He doesn't intend to stick around that long, however.",

      "Taurasi staked her claim as one of the greatest players in women's basketball history since the Mercury selected her with the No. 1 overall pick of the 2004 WNBA draft. In the 20 years that followed, she racked up six Olympic gold medals, three league championships and numerous records before calling it a career earlier this year.",
      "The 6-foot-9 Griner was a force during her 11-year stay in the desert, throwing down dunks and swatting shots like no other player while helping the Mercury win their most recent championship, in 2014. She opted to test free agency and signed a one-year contract with the Dream, hoping to set herself up for a bigger contract when the league's new collective bargaining deal is in place next year.",
      "Those are two big holes to fill, but general manager Nick U\u2019Ren already had the wheels in motion to start the Mercury's new era.",
      "Phoenix first acquired Thomas in a trade with Connecticut, adding a veteran do-everything forward who's the WNBA\u2019s career leader with 15 triple-doubles. The 6-2 forward played her entire 11-year career with the Sun, leading them to the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022, and earned a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.",
      "With Taurasi's retirement looming, Phoenix pulled off a three-way trade that brought Sabally to the desert. The 6-4 forward was an All-WNBA first-teamer in 2023, then averaged 17.9 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.0 assists in a 2024 season limited to 15 games because of a shoulder injury.",
      "\u201cPushing through uncomfortable times really makes us stronger and we are the pros at pushing through adversity,\u201d Sabally said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been through a lot in my life, but it just really makes you appreciate times like this even more.\u201d",
      "Rounding out Phoenix's new Big Three is Kahleah Copper, a dynamic scorer and leader.",
      "The 6-1 small forward was a three-time All-Star with Chicago before being traded to Phoenix, where she had a massive impact in just one season.",
      "Copper was the WNBA's third-leading scorer at 21.1 points per game last season and became a leader on a team that already had two of the game's best players. She also has a WNBA title under her belt, helping the Sky beat the Mercury in the 2021 finals.",
      "Now that Taurasi and Griner are gone, Copper fully will take the reigns as the team's leader, pushing teammates new and old to continue the Mercury's long history of winning.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re really going to see her kind of like spread her wings and take pride,\u201d second-year Mercury coach Nate Tibbetts said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it this whole offseason, adding the free agents, and she\u2019s really kind of bought into what we\u2019re about.\u201d",
      "The Mercury had no choice but to take a new direction with Taurasi and Griner gone. They're hoping the new core can lead the franchise along the same winning direction.",

      "North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick defended girlfriend Jordon Hudson for interjecting during a CBS interviewer's questions about their relationship and said she was \u201csimply doing her job.\"",
      "The six-time Super Bowl-winning head coach and first-time college coach at UNC issued a statement through the school Wednesday, which followed an appearance on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning\u201d to promote his upcoming book on his coaching life. In the interview, Hudson objected to a question about how the two had met while Tony Dokoupil referred to her during the segment as being a \u201cconstant presence\u201d in the interview.",
      "\u201cThe final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation which we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career,\u201d Belichick said in his statement. \u201cInstead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "CBS spokesman Richard Huff didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "The awkward interview added to the attention and curiosity that has followed the 73-year-old Belichick, hired as the Tar Heels' head coach in December after his ultra-successful run with the New England Patriots, and the 24-year-old Hudson, who has frequently posted glimpses into their relationship with social media photos. That has included her role in Belichick's transition to college coaching, such as a March public records report by The Assembly about Belichick's request for an athletic official at UNC to copy in Hudson on emails sent to him.",
      "In his Wednesday statement, Belichick said he shares \u201cboth a personal and professional relationship\u201d with Hudson and that he expected the interview would focus solely on the book release instead of his personal life. He said Hudson had \u201cstepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion\" in an effort to \u201censure the interview stayed on track.\u201d",
      "He also said the couple has \u201cbeen open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021.\u201d",
      "During the CBS interview, Belichick shrugged off attention on his relationship with Hudson, saying: \u201cNever been too worried about what everybody else thinks, just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\u201d",
      "When Dokoupil asked how they met, Hudson \u2014 sitting at a nearby table \u2014 said flatly: \u201cWe're not talking about this.\u201d",
      "In a statement Tuesday, InkWell Management \u2014 a literary agency working with Belichick on his upcoming book \u2014 said the interview \u201cveered\u201d into a discussion of Belichick's personal life and resulted \"in a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cBill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "LONDON -- British retailer Marks & Spencer said Friday that it's \u201cworking day and night\u201d to resolve a cyberattack nearly two weeks ago that has left it unable to process any online orders, a day after luxury London department store Harrods confirmed it had become the latest target.",
      "With Co-op also having shut down some of its information technology systems as a precaution following a hack, there are growing concerns within the retail sector that hackers are taking calculated risks by trying to replicate the actions of others to cause as much disruption as they can.",
      "According to reports, a hacking group known as Scattered Spider is said to be behind the M&S attack, although this hasn't been confirmed. It remains unclear if the three attacks are linked.",
      "So far, M&S has been the most high-profile victim of the recent spate of attacks, and its chief executive Stuart Machin told customers that he is \u201creally sorry\u201d about the disruption.",
      "\u201cWe are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible,\" he said.",
      "M&S first reported the issue over the Easter weekend two weeks ago and has seen its operations impacted for more than a week. Initially, the company saw contactless payments and click and collect orders affected, though contactless has since been restored.",
      "Last Friday, it also said it would no longer be able to take orders through its website or app in order to deal with the problem. And the company, which has around 65,000 employees, has been unable to hire new workers after pulling job postings from its website.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police force has launched an investigation into the attack on M&S.",
      "M&S's latest update comes a day after Harrods said it had restricted internet access across its sites as a precautionary measure following an attempt to gain unauthorized access to its systems.",
      "\u201cWe are not asking our customers to do anything differently at this point, and we will continue to provide updates as necessary,\" Harrods said in a statement.",
      "\u201cComing on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend,\" said Cody Barrow, chief executive of cybersecurity experts EclecticIQ. \u201cThe flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains.\u201d",
      "Experts are saying that generative artificial intelligence is accelerating the threat landscape, and that firms and individuals have to stay on top of developments and shore up their defenses against cyberattacks.",
      "The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that it was working with organizations affected as well as providing expert advice to others in the sector.",
      "\u201cThese incidents should act as a wake-up call to all organizations,\" agency CEO Richard Horne said.",

      "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

      "She can groove to rock and electronica. But the 15-year-old California sea lion's talent shines most in bobbing to disco hits like \u201cBoogie Wonderland.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers plan to train and test other sea lions. Cook suspects other sea lions can also bob to a beat \u2014 but that Ronan will still stand out as a star performer.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is clearly not how our AI should operate,\" Kaplan said on X. \"We\u2019re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn\u2019t address the underlying problem.\u201d",
      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

      "As members of the Picuris Pueblo seek a greater voice in shaping decisions about the future of Chaco Canyon, where debates about oil and gas drilling loom, leaders including Quanchello decided that using DNA sequencing to complement or corroborate their oral histories could be a useful tool. The group began a collaboration with an international team of geneticists.",
      "\"The DNA could help us protect\" our heritage, he said. \"Now we can say, \u2018This is ours, we need to protect it.\u2019\"",

      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d to begin the collaboration with scientists, said co-author and Picuris Gov. Wayne Yazza. \u201cThis is life-changing data.\u201d",
      "There are 19 Pueblo tribes in New Mexico. The new study does not refute the historic connections of other tribes to Chaco Canyon.",
      "Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site managed by the U.S. National Park Service. It is famous for sweeping desert vistas and for monumental sandstone structures \u2014 including multistory homes and ceremonial structures \u2014 built by ancestral Pueblos.",

      "Microsoft has pledged to fight any U.S. government order to halt data center operations in Europe, as it sought to soothe concerns among European customers that trans-Atlantic tensions would lead to service disruptions",
      "LONDON -- Microsoft pledged Wednesday to fight any U.S. government order to halt data center operations in Europe as it sought to soothe concerns among European customers that trans-Atlantic tensions would lead to service disruptions.",
      "The company's president, Brad Smith, said it's not something that officials are talking about in Washington, D.C. but it is a \u201creal concern\u201d for Microsoft's customers across Europe, which include governments.",
      "President Donald Trump has stoked tensions between the U.S. and Europe with his tariff-fueled trade war, and alarmed European leaders with policy changes, including pausing intelligence sharing with Ukraine, that throw into doubt his administration's commitment to the trans-Atlantic relationship.",
      "Smith, speaking at an event in Brussels, tried to allay concerns as he announced that the company was expanding data center operations across Europe.",
      "\u201cWhat we want Europeans to know is that they can count on us,\u201d he said in a speech.",
      "\u201cIn the unlikely event we are ever ordered by any government anywhere in the world to suspend or cease cloud operations in Europe, we are committing that Microsoft will promptly and vigorously contest such a measure using all legal avenues available, including by pursuing litigation in court,\u201d Smith wrote in a Wednesday blog post.",
      "He noted that Microsoft has experience fighting lawsuits from the previous Trump administration as well as from former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cIf we ever find ourselves losing we will put in place business continuity arrangements\u201d that include storing computer code in Switzerland that European partners can access, he said.",
      "Microsoft is making five digital commitments to Europe, including increasing its data center capacity by 40% over the next two years and expanding data center operations in 16 countries, Smith said. He did not list the countries. The expansion will cost tens of billions of dollars annually. Smith declined to be more specific about the cost when asked by reporters.",
      "The expansion comes amid calls for Europe to assert tech and data sovereignty by weaning itself off reliance from big U.S. cloud data service providers, including Microsoft, Amazon and, to a lesser extent, Google.",
      "\u201cGiven recent geopolitical volatility, we recognize that European governments likely will consider additional options,\u201d and Microsoft is committed to collaborating with European companies, Smith said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement that will give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast critical mineral resources",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

      "BEIJING -- Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Wednesday after six months on China's space station.",
      "The crew\u2019s landing module came down slowly after separating from the return vehicle, descending on a red-and-white parachute, in Dongfeng, in China\u2019s northern Inner Mongolia region on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Their return had been delayed by a day due to strong winds and low visibility. The area is prone to sandstorms this time of year.",
      "The astronauts, Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, were launched to the Tiangong space station in October, and they turned over control of the station Tuesday to the new crew that recently arrived to replace them.",

      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",
      "China\u2019s space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",
      "The three Chinese astronauts have carried out experiments and improvements to the space station during their time in space. Two of the astronauts, Cai and Song, conducted a nine-hour spacewalk, the world\u2019s longest, during their mission, China's space agency said.",
      "The country\u2019s space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The space agency has landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "The astronauts, Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, were originally due to land Tuesday in Dongfeng, in China's northern Inner Mongolia region, after spending six months in space. The landing was postponed to \u201cguarantee the health and safety of the astronauts\u201d because weather conditions were not optimal, according to the official Xinhua news agency.",
      "The three were sent up to China's Tiangong space station in October last year, and a new crew of astronauts recently arrived to replace them.",
      "The three Chinese astronauts have carried out experiments and improvements to the space station during their time on board. Two of the astronauts, Cai and Song, conducted a nine-hour space walk, the world's longest, during their mission, the Manned Space Agency said.",
      "China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station owing to U.S. national security concerns over the control of the country\u2019s space program by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",
      "The country's space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The space agency has landed an explorer on Mars and a rover on the far side of the moon. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.",
      "Last year, two American astronauts wound up stuck in space for nine months after a test flight with Boeing ran into problems and NASA determined it was too risky for the astronauts to come back to Earth in the same capsule.",

      "Artificial intelligence technology that works well for the world\u2019s billions of people of color was a business imperative for Google when the company asked sociologist Ellis Monk to help make its AI products more inclusive",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.",
      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "The public broadcasting group said only Congress controls its funding.",
      "The nonprofit corporation that oversees National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service is firing back at President Donald Trump's executive order to pull funding for the two popular media outlets.",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting pointed out that Congress controls its funding, not the president.",
      "\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the CPB, said in a statement Friday. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\"",
      "She continued, \"In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.'\"",
      "On his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \"cease direct funding to NPR and PBS.\"",
      "The order blocks federal funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law, according to a fact sheet from the White House. It also prevents indirect funding to PBS and NPR by prohibiting local public radio and television stations, and any other recipients of CPB funds, from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.",
      "The order mandates that the CPB revise its 2025 General Provisions to explicitly prohibit direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS. It directs all federal agencies to terminate any direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS and to review existing grants and contracts for compliance. Additionally, it instructs the Federal Communications Commission and relevant agencies to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination.",
      "In the fact sheet, the White House claims the two news organizations \"have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "The heads of PBS and NPR testified at a House hearing in March about their funding.",
      "\"I hear, respect and understand your concerns regarding bias and whether public media is relevant in a commercial landscape,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said at the hearing. \"It is critical for NPR's newsroom to operate with the highest journalistic standards. That means they do their jobs independently, and as CEO I have no editorial role at NPR.\"",
      "Minutes later, PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger added: \"PBS stations are focused on the needs and interests of the viewers they serve. Especially in rural areas, PBS stations are the only outlets providing coverage for local events, for example high school sports, local history and culture content, candidate debates at every level of the election ballot and specialized agricultural news.\"",
      "NPR and PBS are primarily funded through a combination of public and private sources. The CPB, a federal agency, provides a portion of the funding, along with private donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. The CPB oversees dozens of media organizations in addition to NPR and PBS, including everything from American Public Media to Native Public Media and Public Media in Mid-America.",
      "Those in the Senate and House quickly responded along party lines.",
      "\"The fact that taxpayers are forced to subsidize far-left propaganda outlets like NPR is an outrage,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. \"I commend President Trump for his common-sense order ending taxpayer funding for liberal media outlets.",
      "\"President Trump is once again walking us towards authoritarianism, by eliminating funds for PBS and NPR, claiming it will stop 'biased and partisan news coverage,'\" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., wrote on X. \"NPR and PBS is how 160 million Americans find their fact-based, impartial news each month.\"",
      "\"These organizations were created under an act of Congress, and therefore cannot be eliminated in an executive order,\" he continued. \"We need these programs and must challenge this ruling in the courts.\"",

      "Most of President Donald Trump\u2019s top nominees have sailed through the Senate with little resistance",
      "WASHINGTON -- Most of President Donald Trump\u2019s top nominees have sailed through the Senate with little resistance. His pick to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation\u2019s capital could be an exception.",
      "Ed Martin Jr., a conservative activist with modest legal experience who has defended rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is testing Republican party loyalties as a deadline approaches for the Senate to decide whether to extend or end his brief but tumultuous tenure as leader of the country\u2019s largest U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Martin\u2019s nomination faces vocal opposition from hundreds of veterans of the office that he is leading on an interim basis. Democrats are trying to tie up his confirmation vote. And Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have said they need more time to review his record.",
      "There were signs of trouble at a Judiciary meeting on Thursday as Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said it was his understanding that committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was going to announce \u201cthat we are not going to move forward on the Martin nomination.\u201d",
      "Grassley demurred, saying he would wait to talk about Martin until the committee scheduled a vote. But he said he was still going through hundreds of questions that the committee had posed to Martin, adding that some of his staff \u201chad more questions\u201d and wanted to meet with him in person.",
      "It was hardly a ringing endorsement of Martin, who hasn\u2019t spent much time in courtrooms but has been a devoted loyalist to Trump.",
      "Within days of taking office in January, Martin fired or demoted veteran attorneys who prosecuted Trump supporters for storming the U.S. Capitol. Before his appointment, he represented and helped raise money for Capitol riot defendants. He frequently appeared on Russian state media to parrot Trump talking points. He even published coloring books glorifying Trump's tweets.",
      "Martin hasn\u2019t responded to several Associated Press interview requests since he took office in January, including this week.",
      "Martin recently told NBC Washington that he is confident that Trump made the \u201cright decision\u201d in nominating him. He has touted his office's work tackling violent crime. And he has told lawmakers that his opinions won\u2019t influence his office decisions.",
      "\u201cWe have to keep the streets safe AND fight for America on the world stage. Amazing work and I am blessed to serve Donald Trump in this way,\" Martin wrote in a Substack post.",
      "Any vote on Martin's nomination is bound to be split along party lines. But first, Democrats are calling for a rare hearing where they can grill him.",
      "The Judiciary panel traditionally does not hold confirmation hearings for U.S. attorneys, relying on questionnaires instead.",
      "Even if the committee were to approve Martin\u2019s nomination, it would face obstacles on the Senate floor. California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff placed a hold on the nomination, meaning Republicans would have to spend several days of floor time to confirm him. U.S. attorneys are generally approved in groups by a quick voice vote.",
      "Schiff last month said Martin \u201chas consistently undermined the independence and abused the power of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in D.C.\" since taking office.",
      "Martin has touted endorsements from leading conservative figures, including Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump Jr. Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, also have expressed support.",
      "Paul in a post on X said he's confident Martin will \u201cwork to clean up DC and fight against the left\u2019s lawless judicial tyranny. Proud to support him as U.S. Attorney!\"",
      "His supporters have said his record fighting conservative causes makes him the right person to lead the office that critics have claimed unfairly treated Jan. 6 defendants and should have been more focused on bringing down street crime. Weeks into the job, he announced a \u201cMake D.C. Safe Again\u201d initiative to bring more gun cases in federal court, where penalties are stiffer.",
      "But a least one Republican member of the committee appears to have reservations. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who has expressed some concerns about Martin\u2019s Jan. 6 comments, said Thursday that he will meet with Martin next week.",
      "Trump appointed Martin the same week in January that he issued mass pardons to supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol four years ago. It was a morale-destroying choice for prosecutors who spent four years building cases against over 1,500 riot defendants, the largest investigation in Justice Department history.",
      "Martin was a leading figure in Trump's \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He spoke at a rally in Washington on the eve of the riot. He also represented three Jan. 6 defendants, which he ranked among the top 10 cases of his legal career on his committee questionnaire.",
      "Former federal prosecutor Michael Romano, who was detailed to help supervise Jan. 6 prosecutions, returned to his home office in the Justice Department before Martin arrived. And yet Martin tried to demote Romano to an entry-level position along with other senior prosecutors who worked on Capitol riot cases.",
      "\u201cHe appeared not to realize that I didn\u2019t work for him,\u201d said Romano, who recently joined a private law firm. \u201cIt was a moment that made my eyes roll.\u201d",
      "Martin served on the board of the nonprofit Patriot Freedom Project, which reports raising over $2.5 million to support Jan. 6 defendants. Last year, he presented an award to a Capitol riot defendant, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, who openly espoused white supremacist and antisemitic ideology and photographed himself sporting a Hitler mustache. He referred to Hale-Cusanelli as a friend who is \u201can extraordinary guy.\u201d",
      "Martin told committee members that he condemns Hale-Cusanelli's hateful comments as \"abhorrent and deplorable.\" He claimed he didn't learn about them until after he presented him with the award during an event at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.",
      "But Martin alluded to the controversy when he interviewed Hale-Cusanelli before the awards ceremony. Martin accused prosecutors of leaking photos of Hale-Cusanelli sporting the Hitler mustache to taint the jury pool.",
      "\"Not your best moment, but not illegal,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Critics have accused Martin of abusing his office \u2014 and his account on Musk's X platform \u2014 to intimidate potential targets of investigations.",
      "At least three medical journals received letters from Martin asking about \u201ccompeting viewpoints.\u201d Another letter that he sent on office stationery accused Wikipedia of \u201callowing foreign actors to manipulate information and spread propaganda to the American public.\u201d",
      "Martin had a habit of getting ensnared in political controversies \u2014 and litigation \u2014 during his earlier forays into public service. Nearly two decades ago, he was chief of staff for then-Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt when he was sued by a former staff attorney who claimed he was fired in retaliation for complaining that the administration was destroying e-mails illegally.",
      "Martin was chairman of the Missouri Republican Party before becoming president of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum in April 2013. He co-authored a book about Trump with Schlafly, who died in 2016.",
      "Martin has referred to himself as one of the president\u2019s lawyers. His critics have call him unqualified and unfit for the job.",
      "\u201cEd Martin has less experience than a misdemeanor assistant does after a week in basic training. That\u2019s not an exaggeration,\u201d said Kevin Flynn, who worked as a prosecutor under roughly a dozen U.S. attorneys in Washington before leaving the office in 2023. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not exactly learning on the job, either.\u201d",

      "The World Trade Center Health Program is once again certifying illnesses linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks after a chaotic few weeks that left some cancer patients, including first responders, without access to treatment.",
      "Certification is the process by which the federal program confirms that a 9/11-related illnesses qualify for treatment or compensation.",
      "Dr. John Howard, the program's administrator, is the only official authorized to approve these certifications, and his status was in question for weeks.",
      "Howard was laid off in February and allegedly reinstated following public backlash; however, there were signs that he was not fully and formally reinstated, including a freeze on certifications requiring his signature as late as Thursday morning.",

      "Dr. David Prezant, the New York City Fire Department's chief medical officer and director of its World Trade Center Health Program, confirmed to ABC News that he received the memo, and he was once again able to treat new patients.",
      "The notice signals a turning point after what Prezant had said were weeks of silence, confusion and life-threatening delays.",
      "It also followed a federal order laying off 20% of its staff in April \u2014 just months after it fired, then reinstated, a spate of staff members, including Howard.",

      "\"Any questions about Dr. Howard's authorities as Administrator have been resolved \u2014 as confirmed directly with Dr. Howard himself,\" Garbarino wrote to ABC News in a statement. \"Now, enrollments and certifications that were left in limbo must be addressed immediately.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: anything that jeopardizes care for 9/11 responders and survivors is indefensible,\" the statement added.",
      "Ben Chevat, executive director of Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act, credited media coverage and bipartisan pressure for forcing the reversal.",
      "\"I'm glad that the 9/11 responders who need cancer care are going to get their cancer care \u2014 but they should never have been delayed,\" he said.",

      "For now, clinics have been told they will see newly processed certifications by May 5 at the latest. The program's staff and its supporters say they're relieved \u2014 but remain wary about the future.",

    "summary": "Experts are pushing back after the HHS released a report, calling for the use of psychotherapy among children and teens with gender dysphoria over gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say gender-affirming care is safe and improves youth mental health.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released what it called a \"comprehensive review\" of transgender care for children and teens on Thursday, calling for broader use of psychotherapy for young people with gender dysphoria rather than gender-affirming care.",
      "The more than 400-page document details alleged harms from medical interventions for youth, including the use of puberty blockers, and alleged risks, such as infertility.",
      "The \"review of evidence and best practices report\" is a response to a January executive order issued by President Donald Trump, saying the federal government would not \"fund, sponsor, promote, assist or support\" transition care for those under age 19.",
      "\"Our duty is to protect our nation's children -- not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement on Thursday. \"We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\"",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by multiple major medical organizations. It can range from allowing a child to pick their pronouns to treatments typically prescribed for older teens. Studies show treatments are generally safe and that care has a positive impact on mental health, which psychotherapy alone cannot provide, experts said.",
      "\"Requiring that somebody [go] through a prescribed course of therapy can be misused by governments to try to essentially block access to care,\" Dr. Dan Karasic, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, told ABC News. \"There just isn't evidence that psychotherapy resolves gender dysphoria.\"",
      "Safety of puberty blockers, hormone therapies",
      "One of the most common treatments in gender-affirming care is the use of puberty blockers, which are used to delay the onset of puberty among transgender and gender-diverse youth.",
      "The report claimed its review of studies found low evidence that puberty blockers are safe or that they improved mental health among children with gender dysphoria, and \"high certainty evidence\" that they often cause infertility.",
      "The reported also stated, \"Low certainty evidence suggests that puberty blockers may compromise bone health.\"",
      "However, studies have shown that adults who used puberty blockers in the past experienced menstrual cycles, childbirth and miscarriages at similar rates to those of the general population.",
      "Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor in pediatrics at Stanford University in California, said puberty blockers have been used as a treatment for more than 30 years, primarily for a condition called CPP, or central precocious puberty, which is when puberty begins too early.",
      "\"These medications are immensely well-studied,\" she told ABC News. \"The long-term effects of puberty-pausing medications, when used in children, for temporary periods of time, do function as a completely reversible pause button.\"",
      "She said side effects related to sexual function or bone density are usually seen among adults, who may take the medications for prostate cancer in order to reduce testosterone, or endometriosis.",
      "The HHS report also discussed cross-sex hormones, more commonly known as hormone therapies, claiming there is \"high certainty evidence\" that hormone therapies have \"physiological effects\" and that many studies were \"not specifically designed to capture the full range of long-term outcomes.\"",
      "Although hormones can carry side effects, like any medicine, they can greatly improve the mental health of those with gender dysphoria, studies show.",
      "Ladinsky said hormone therapies are often used with older adolescents who have had sustained gender dysphoria over a long period of time.",
      "Hormone therapies \"are all used and have been used in pediatric and adolescent medicine, for a long, long, long time,\" she said. \"Any person who's ever used combination birth control pills has taken oral estrogen. So, it's not that these medicines are unique, experimental, pulled off a shelf. They're standard pharmacology in the practice of medicine.\"",
      "Controversy around surgeries",
      "The review said it found three studies on surgeries for children or adolescents with gender dysphoria \"with most considering mastectomy only.\"",
      "Gender-affirming mastectomy, known colloquially as \"top surgery,\" is a surgical procedure that removes breast tissue to create a more masculine-looking chest.",
      "The report said authors found low certainty of evidence on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries on adolescents including suicidality, depression, asexual function, quality of life and regret.",
      "Ladinsky said there are no gender-affirming genital surgeries that occur on minors and no other gender-affirming surgeries being performed on young children.",
      "\"There is a very small group of trans-masculine older teens, meaning 17-ish, 18, who -- in our evidence-based, guideline-driven standard of care -- does allow for a tiny group of these older trans-masculine teens with overwhelming and sustained gender dysphoria to have masculinizing chest surgery,\" she said.",
      "Ladinsky continued, \"That is very, very rare and that procedure can only be done with long periods of oversight around gender dysphoria with doctors, immense parental consent and professional endorsement by those caring for the young person.\"",
      "HHS advocates for psychotherapy",
      "The HHS report advocates for the use of psychotherapy as a treatment for children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria,\" the report stated. \"Systematic reviews of evidence have found no evidence of adverse effects of psychotherapy in this context.\"",
      "Karasic said certain kinds of psychotherapy can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression among both cisgender and transgender individuals, but psychotherapy should not be considered a substitute for gender-affirming care.",
      "\"There's absolutely no evidence that psychotherapy is a substitute for those people who need medical care,\" he told ABC News. \"There's substantial evidence for the benefits of [gender-affirming] care for minors, and that's why all mainstream medical and mental health groups support this versus no evidence of psychotherapy being a substitute.\"",
      "Karasic said psychotherapy is not bad, but rather that it has its place and, very often, children and teenagers receive psychotherapy along with medical intervention.",
      "\"If people are proposing the availability of therapy for people who need it, I think everyone would agree with that,\" he said. \"But when people are saying that medical intervention should not be provided because therapy can be used instead, that's wrong. There's just no evidence to support that.\"",
      "Response from the medical community",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on Thursday saying it is \"deeply alarmed\" by the HHS report.",
      "\"For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,\" the statement read in part. \"This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\"",
      "AAP also released a statement with several groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Psychiatric Association, opposing an infringement on medical care.",
      "\"Our organizations have consistently opposed any legislation, regulation or executive action that interferes in the confidential relationship between a patient and their physician or undermines the provision of evidence-based standards of patient care and physician training and education,\" the statement, released on Thursday, read. \"Patients must must be able to discuss health issues with their trusted physician to determine together what care is best for them.\"",
      "More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced throughout the 2024 legislative session, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Ladinsky said these bills are harmful and they don't resolve gender dysphoria for anyone.",
      "\"If government-sanctioned, blatant misinformation is utilized to make policy decisions that affect millions of Americans, we are opening a Pandora's box to greatly diminish the health of all people, rather than elevating it,\" she said. \"The other thing important is that we know from 25 states that have rendered illegal elements of this care, it hasn't made any children of trans identity no longer trans.\"",

      "President Donald Trump, celebrating the 100-day mark of his second term with his Cabinet, admitted his tariffs could mean higher prices for Americans, but appeared to dismiss the impact on American families, including on children's toys.",
      "\"You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"You know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,\" the president continued. \"But, we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way.\"",
      "Trump went on to claim Americans didn't \"need\" many of the products that are imported from China, the world's second largest economy and the United States' third largest trading partner.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who joined press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a special briefing Thursday morning, argued Americans would be willing to pay more for American-made dolls.",
      "\"He was making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with, which is if they had a choice between a -- and I'm a parent of young children -- a choice between a doll from China that might have, say, lead paint in it, that is not as well constructed as a doll made in America, that has a higher environmental and regulatory standard, and that is made to a higher degree of quality, and those two products are both on Amazon that yes, you probably would be willing to pay more for a better made American product,\" Miller said.",
      "Trump's comments on dolls came a day after he pushed back on economic anxieties in an exclusive interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Hard times are ahead?\" ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran asked the president.",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Trump responded. \"I think great times are ahead.\"",
      "Trump's defended his tariff plan -- which includes product-specific levies on steel, aluminum and cars, a baseline 10% tariff on virtually all trade partners and a whopping $145% tariff on China -- as necessary to combat unfair trade deficits with other nations.",
      "He's also argued the taxes will bring a boost in manufacturing as companies will invest to make their products in America instead.",
      "But the administration's bumpy tariff rollout wiped away trillions in wealth as markets tumbled. Businesses continue to warn of possible price hikes and potential product shortages due to the levies. Trump said on Wednesday night, during a town hall with NewsNation, that he was in no rush to negotiate trade deals.",
      "Trump's message for Americans who may have concerns at the prospect of higher prices and other economic impacts was they voted for it -- despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail to bring down prices on Day 1 of his administration.",
      "\"With the economy, the number one issue for so many people, for just about everybody. It -- it's one of the main reasons that you're back in this office. And now we have this trade war with China that -- that Moody's and other analysts say is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, sayin', 'I didn't sign up for this.' So how do you answer those concerns?\" ABC's Moran asked Trump.",
      "\"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,\" Trump responded. \"I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before \u2026 I could've left it that way, and at some point, there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it.' I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.\"",
      "The president's also repeatedly insisted that China will be hit harder in the trade war.",
      "\"You don't know whether or not China's gonna eat it,\" Trump told ABC on Tuesday.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Trump sought to deflect blame by pinning the contraction on his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" he posted on his conservative social media site. (In January 2024, when Biden was still president, Trump took credit for positive stock markets and cited poll numbers that showed him ahead of Biden).",
      "Trump even preemptively blamed Biden for second quarter data as well.",
      "\"This is Biden,\" he said. \"And you could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn't just happen on a daily or an hourly basis,\" he said during his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.",

      "The former presidential candidate spoke as she considers re-entering politics.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

    "story": [
      "Promise comes amid review into equal opportunity programs, cuts to personnel.",
      "The U.S. military's standards for investigating sex assault reports and sexual harassment complaints will remain unchanged, a senior official told reporters on Thursday, as the Pentagon launches a separate department-wide review into how discrimination claims are handled in general.",
      "The promise also comes as the Defense Department faces a potential loss of personnel available to process sexual assault cases due to efforts by the Trump administration to trim staff across government.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the standard of proof remains the same with regard to any sexual harassment complaint,\" said Dr. Nathan Galbreath, director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.",
      "\"To that end, all complaints are reviewed, the evidence is analyzed, and a legal officer often opines on whether or not action can be taken,\" Galbreath told reporters in a briefing call on tracking sexual assault cases in the military.",
      "Last week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called on service secretaries to review equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints weren't being \"weaponized\" by disgruntled employees.",
      "The military tracks sexual harassment complaints through its equal opportunity personnel.",
      "In his April 23 directive, Hegseth specifically called on secretaries to ensure discrimination \"complaints that are unsubstantiated by actionable, credible evidence are timely dismissed.\" He called it the \"no more walking on eggshells policy.\"",
      "\"Too often, at the Defense Department, there are complaints made that for certain reasons that can't be verified that end people's careers,\" Hegseth said in a video posted on X.",
      "\"Some individuals use these programs in bad faith to retaliate against superiors or peers. I hear that all the time,\" he said of employee discrimination complaints.",
      "Galbreath and other officials said Hegseth's directive won't impact how sexual assault reports or sexual harassment complaints are handled.",
      "Still, Hegseth\u2019s directive rattled advocates who say they are worried the secretary's orders would discourage people when thinking about coming forward with any misconduct, whether its sexual harassment or racial discrimination.",
      "\u201cThis new policy sends a stark and chilling message: report misconduct at your own risk,\u201d wrote Josh Connolly, senior vice president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group aimed at ending sex assault in the military.",
      "When asked if Hegseth's latest mandate will raise the standard of proof for sexual assault victims, Galbreath said \"no.\"",
      "When it comes to sexual assault, unfounded reports are extraordinarily rare. According to the military, 1% of cases involve evidence that either exonerates the person accused or shows the crime did not occur.",
      "President Donald Trump also asked the Pentagon to review regulations that are potentially burdensome and streamline operations, an effort that resulted in offers to employees for early retirement as well as hiring freezes across the department.",
      "Galbreath and other officials told reporters Thursday that they aren't sure exactly how the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program will be affected just yet when it comes to staff levels.",
      "When a recent hiring freeze went into effect, there were about 300 sexual assault prevention jobs put on hold, said Dr. Andra Tharp, director of the Defense Department's office of command climate and well-being integration.",
      "\"We're really trying to get our arms around total impacts of that,\" she said.",
      "Galbreath said he is encouraging the services to seek hiring exemptions for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates.",
      "He said that 100% of victim services remain available now and that sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates are stationed at every military installation around the world.",
      "The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year, according to data released by the department.",
      "The report is the first full-year account since the Pentagon put in place new prosecution procedures that empower independent lawyers, rather than military commanders. The changes were called for by lawmakers who said not enough was being done to encourage personnel to report assault.",
      "\"Even though we'd like to see the number of reports increase, I'm still very satisfied that our military members know that they can come forward,\" and \"get the help that they need to recover,\" said Galbreath.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote. The updated version correctly attributes to Dr. Nathan Galbreath the quote on encouraging the services to seek hiring exemptions for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates.",

      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press release. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.

      "Ukraine had planned to separate the signing dates, as the creation of the fund agreement was still being finalized, the source added.",

      "Ukraine said it was ready to sign but ran into a last-minute snag when the U.S. requested it sign both the mineral resources agreement and the investment fund agreement at the same time, a Ukrainian official told ABC News. The U.S. refuted that series of events in comments during President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting Wednesday, saying it was \"ready to sign\" the agreement but the Ukrainians decided on Tuesday night to \"make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Our side is ready to sign,\" Bessent said.",

      "Trump then put the mineral resources agreement into \"context,\" talking about the amount of money the U.S. has given to Ukraine's war effort. But he seemed optimistic about the prospect of the agreement coming together.",
      "\"But we haven't really seen the fruits of that deal yet. I suspect we will,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were originally set to sign the minerals deal in late February, but the plan was derailed following a tense exchange between the two men in the Oval Office.",

      "\"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Trump wrote on his conservative social media platform. \"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role.\"",
      "\"In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department,\" Trump continued. \"Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "Sources had told ABC News earlier Thursday that Waltz was expected to leave his post as national security adviser.",

He\u2019s got the trust of both me and the president. But we also thought that he\u2019d make a better U.N. ambassador as we get beyond this stage of the reforms that we\u2019ve made to the National Security Council.\"",
      "\"If the president wanted to fire him over the Signal thing, which, by the way, was a total nothingburger of a story, he would\u2019ve just done it,\" Vance said.",
      "Rubio was a National Prayer Event at the White House earlier Thursday before the news broke. He was seen standing in the colonnade on his phone, and at times speaking with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned about Rubio replacing Waltz in the middle of Thursday's press briefing. She was being asked by reporters on whether Rubio would consider the position when Trump's social media post came out.",
      "\"It is clear that I just heard this from you,\" Bruce said as she reacted to the news in real time. She praised Rubio as \"a man who, as I think you all know, has worn several hats from day one\" and is \"someone who is well known by the president.\"",
      "Bruce said the move was not \"not entirely surprising,\" but acknowledged \"these last 100 days, it's like hanging onto a freaking bullet train.\"",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- United Nations officials have circulated proposals for a vast consolidation of its operations and other sweeping reforms to root out inefficiencies, overlaps and cost overruns as the world body faces a critical funding crunch, according an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The proposals, which are in the early stages of discussion and are far from certain to be adopted, would amount to one of the biggest overhauls of the U.N., which has been upended by funding cuts from its biggest donor, the United States, under President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "The document, labeled \u201cstrictly confidential,\u201d falls under a reform initiative known as UN80 that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched in March. It comes as the United Nations is set to celebrate its 80th anniversary this summer \u2014 with its ability to work on resolving conflicts; help feed and house the poor, destitute and displaced; fight disease; and many other of its lofty humanitarian ambitions increasingly in doubt.",
      "\u201cThe memo is the preliminary result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the secretary-general\u2019s vision,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",
      "He noted that it was just one way the U.N. is working on reforms and that \u201cthis exercise is designed to ensure we are responsible stewards of the monies from hardworking taxpayers around the world who underwrite everything we do through member state contributions.\u201d",
      "The memo notes \u201csignificant overlaps, inefficiencies, and increased costs in the UN system\u201d and a \u201cfragmented development system\u201d \u2014 an allusion to the work to help poorer or conflict-battered countries build and rebuild.",
      "The document, in an apparent signal to aid cutbacks by the U.S. and other Western countries, noted that \u201cgeopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets are challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Organization.\u201d",
      "Among the main ideas were options for a merger of multiple organizations \u2014 possibly including the U.N. bodies for peacekeeping; drugs and crime; development assistance; and the office of the special adviser on Africa \u2014 into one Peace and Security entity.",
      "Other options could include moving U.N. peace and security operations \u201ccloser to the field,\u201d with a more regional, decentralized management, and a \u201ccomprehensive restructuring\u201d of the political and peacekeeping operations.",
      "Another proposal would form a single humanitarian entity, such as by creating a \u201cstreamlined\u201d organization that pulls together the U.N.'s aid coordinator, refugee agency and migration agency and \u201cleveraging\u201d the expertise of the World Food Program.",
      "More broadly, the proposed reforms would affect the U.N.'s approach to new technologies like artificial intelligence and alter the internal culture \u2014 down to the way meetings would be structured, operations funded, budgets set and new organizations created in the future.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has again ordered the USS Harry S",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier to remain in the Middle East for a second time, keeping it there another week so the U.S. can maintain two carrier strike groups in the region to battle Yemen-based Houthi rebels, according to a U.S. official.",
      "In late March, Hegseth extended the deployment of the Truman and the warships in its group for a month as part of a campaign to increase strikes on the Iran-backed Houthis. The official said Hegseth signed the latest order Thursday and it is expected the Truman and its strike group warships will head home to Norfolk, Virginia, after the week is up.",
      "Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, requested that the Truman be extended again, according to officials. The San Diego-based USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and its strike group arrived in the region a few weeks ago and are operating in the Gulf of Aden. The Truman, along with two destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is in the Red Sea.",
      "The officials spoke Friday the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.",
      "The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use \u201coverwhelming lethal force\u201d until the Houthis stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a vital trade corridor.",
      "According to Central Command, the U.S. has been waging an \u201cintense and sustained campaign\u201d against the Houthis. In a statement over the weekend, the command said the U.S. has struck more than 1,000 targets in Yemen since Operation Rough Rider began. It hasn't provided details on the targets or how the data is compiled.",
      "It has been rare in recent years for the U.S. to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.",
      "If there are no additional extensions and the Truman and its warships leave the region next week, those sailors could be back home by next month.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time as U.S. warships waged the most intense running sea battle since World War II. Prior to that, it had been years since the U.S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.",
      "The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",

      "Police say a fourth person has died as a result of a mass shooting in Minneapolis in which investigators believe a fifth person was killed in retaliation",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A fourth person has died as a result of a mass shooting in Minneapolis earlier this week in which investigators believe a fifth person was killed in retaliation hours later, police said Friday.",
      "The 28-year-old man had been hospitalized in grave condition since the shootings late Tuesday, and died Thursday shortly after federal authorities arrested a 34-year-old suspect, the Minneapolis Police Department said in a statement.",
      "The shootings shook the large Native American community in the neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis.",
      "Police have said that the victims were Native American and investigators strongly suspect the shootings were gang-related. However, Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said during a news conference Thursday that authorities were still investigating the motives.",
      "\u201cThis is a bittersweet day,\u201d O\u2019Hara said in Friday's statement. \u201cWhile this arrest represents meaningful progress toward justice, that progress is overshadowed by the heartbreaking loss of another life. Our thoughts remain with the victims\u2019 families, their loved ones, and a community that continues to grieve.\u201d",
      "A 20-year-old woman, a 17-year-old boy and a 27-year-old man were also killed in Tuesday\u2019s shootings. A 20-year-old woman was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. About 13 hours later and roughly three blocks away, a 30-year-old man was killed outside an apartment building that houses the Minneapolis offices of the Red Lake Nation tribe.",
      "The first shootings took place just before midnight Tuesday. O\u2019Hara said it\u2019s \u201centirely probable\u201d that the second shooting with the single victim was in retaliation to the three deaths, and he said someone else was responsible.",
      "The chief said police believe the shootings are gang related based on the \u201clived experience\u201d of the people in the area.",
      "The U.S. Marshals Service said its local fugitive task force and an FBI SWAT team arrested a suspect from Minneapolis on Thursday afternoon. Newly unsealed court records show he was charged Wednesday with second-degree murder and being a felon in possession of a firearm. He remained jailed Friday, and court records didn't list an attorney who could comment on his behalf.",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been thrown into two top national security roles at once after President Donald Trump appointed him to temporarily replace Mike Waltz as national security adviser",
      "WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been thrown into two top national security jobs at once as President Donald Trump presses forward with his top-to-bottom revamp of U.S. foreign policy, upending not only longstanding policies that the former Florida senator once supported but also the configuration of the executive branch.",
      "Trump's appointment of Rubio to temporarily replace Mike Waltz as national security adviser is the first major leadership shake-up of the nascent administration, but Waltz's removal had been rumored for weeks \u2014 ever since he created a Signal group chat and accidentally added a journalist to the conversation where top national security officials shared sensitive military plans.",
      "So, just over 100 days into his tenure as America\u2019s top diplomat, Rubio now becomes just the second person to hold both positions. He follows only the late Henry Kissinger, who served as both secretary of state and national security adviser for two years under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in the 1970s.",
      "Rubio \u2014 a one-time Trump rival and hawkish conservative who was derided by the president as \u201cLittle Marco\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 has proven adept at aligning himself with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy positions. Rubio has largely eschewed his staunch advocacy of providing foreign aid and promoting democracy overseas since taking over the State Department, repeating a refrain that every policy or program should make America safer, stronger or more prosperous.",
      "Since being confirmed in a 99-0 Senate floor vote, Rubio has presided over a radical reorganization of the State Department. That includes the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development and plans to cut U.S. jobs by 15% while closing or consolidating more than 100 bureaus worldwide. He has also begun a major cull of the visa system, revoking hundreds, if not thousands, of visas issued to foreign students.",
      "He has overseen the negotiation of agreements to send immigrants accused of crimes to third countries, most notably to El Salvador, in cases that are now being challenged in federal courts.",
      "\u201cMarco Rubio, unbelievable,\" Trump said Thursday before announcing on social media that Waltz would be nominated as ambassador to the United Nations and Rubio would take over as national security adviser in the interim. \"When I have a problem, I call up Marco, he gets it solved.\u201d",
      "That's a far cry from 2016, when Rubio and Trump were competing for the GOP presidential nomination and Rubio warned that Trump was a threat. After Trump won, the relationship remained contentious, but eight years later, Rubio was an enthusiastic Trump supporter who worked his Florida bona fides to get into the president's inner circle.",
      "Yet, even after Rubio was nominated to the top diplomatic job, doubts remained. Many pundits suggested he would last only a short time in office before Trump dismissed him in the same way he did his first-term secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who was fired by tweet in 2018 just 18 months into the job.",
      "Yet Rubio has been resilient. And as of Thursday, he oversees both the State Department and the National Security Council, which is responsible for coordinating all executive branch foreign policy functions, ranging from diplomatic to military and intelligence operations.",
      "Thomas Wright, an NSC official during the Biden administration who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the national security adviser post alone is \u201cmore than a full-time job.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is just very hard to comprehend the idea that you can do this job sort of part time,\u201d Wright said.",
      "He said he watched national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his deputy work 14-15 hour days, six to seven days a week: \u201cI think they felt that they had to do that to do the job properly.\u201d",
      "Appearing Thursday night on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity,\" Rubio was not asked to weigh in on the president\u2019s decision to tap him as national security adviser but did joke that he was barred from adding pope to his list of many jobs because he is married.",
      "But as he marked the first 100 days of Trump's latest term, Rubio applauded the president for his vision.",
      "\u201cI am honored by the trust President Trump placed in me and I am proud of the work the Department of State has done over the past hundred days to implement his agenda and put the American people first,\u201d he wrote Wednesday in a State Department Substack post.",
      "One of Rubio\u2019s former Florida statehouse colleagues, Dan Gelber, a Democrat, said of Rubio's increasing responsibilities that \"Marco is probably, to a certain extent, one of the more reliable Cabinet officers, if not the most reliable.\"",
      "\u201cAnd I can only believe those qualities are even more vital to his current confluence of positions and growing portfolio,\u201d Gelber said. \"He\u2019s not a chaos guy, and I\u2019ve always sort of wondered how he\u2019s going to do in an administration where there seems to be so much chaos. And maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s getting all these positions.\u201d",
      "Rubio's dual-hatted role comes on top of him serving as acting administrator of the largely shut down USAID and as acting head of the National Archives. It puts him in a similar position to that of Trump's longtime personal friend and golfing buddy Steve Witkoff.",
      "As a special envoy, Witkoff is the lead U.S. negotiator in the Iran nuclear talks and in administration peace efforts for the Israel-Hamas war and the Ukraine-Russia war.",
      "In many ways, Rubio and Witkoff are following in the footsteps of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who had multiple roles in the first administration, ranging from the Middle East to Latin America and immigration.",
      "State Department officials appeared taken aback by Trump's appointment of Rubio as acting national security adviser. Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said at a briefing Thursday that she learned the news from a journalist who asked her a question about Trump's post minutes after it appeared on social media.",
      "Officials, however, have noted that Rubio in recent weeks has spent an increasingly large amount of time at the White House away from his posh seventh-floor State Department office in what is known as \u201cMahogany Row,\u201d a corridor known for its wood paneling.",
      "At the same time, these officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel shift, said they did not expect Rubio's duties as secretary of state to change significantly. He still plans to travel on diplomatic missions abroad and likely will delegate at least some of the NSC management to others, they said.",

      "An Illinois landlord found guilty in a vicious hate crime that left a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy dead and his mother severely injured is due in court for sentencing",
      "JOLIET, Ill. -- An Illinois landlord found guilty of a vicious hate crime that left a 6-year-old Muslim boy dead and wounded his mother days after the start of the war in Gaza in 2023 was due in court Friday for sentencing.",
      "A jury convicted 73-year-old Joseph Czuba in February of murder and hate crime charges in the fatal stabbing of Wadee Alfayoumi, who was Palestinian American, and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen. The family had been renting rooms in Czuba\u2019s home in Plainfield, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Chicago, in 2023 when the attack happened.",
      "Central to prosecutors' case was harrowing testimony from the boy\u2019s mother, who said Czuba attacked her before moving on to her son, insisting they had to leave because they were Muslim. Prosecutors also played the 911 call and showed police footage. Czuba's wife, Mary, whom he has since divorced, also testified for the prosecution, saying he had become agitated about the Israel-Hamas war, which had erupted days earlier.",
      "Police said Czuba pulled a knife from a holder on a belt and stabbed the boy 26 times, leaving the knife in the child's body. Some of the bloody crime scene photos were so explicit that the judge agreed to turn television screens showing them away from the audience, which included Wadee's relatives.",
      "\u201cHe could not escape,\u201d Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state\u2019s attorney, told jurors at trial. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy\u2019s body.\u201d",
      "The jury deliberated for 90 minutes before returning a verdict. Czuba is eligible for a minimum prison sentence of 20 to 60 years or life, according to the Will County state's attorney's office.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment ahead of Friday's hearing and have not said what sentence they will seek. Illinois does not have the death penalty.",
      "The attack renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination and hit particularly hard in Plainfield and surrounding suburbs, which have a large and established Palestinian community. Wadee's funeral drew large crowds and Plainfield officials have dedicated a park playground in his honor.",
      "Czuba did not speak during the trial. His defense attorneys argued that there were holes in the case. His public defender, George Lenard, has not addressed reporters and declined comment ahead of the sentencing.",
      "Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover.",
      "She said there were no prior issues in the two years she rented from the Czubas, even sharing a kitchen and a living room.",
      "Then after the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. He later confronted Shaheen and attacked her, holding her down, stabbing her and trying to break her teeth.",
      "\u201cHe told me \u2019You, as a Muslim, must die,\u201d said Shaheen, who testified in English and Arabic though a translator.",
      "Police testified that officers found Czuba outside the house, sitting on the ground with blood on his body and hands.",
      "Separately, civil lawsuits have been filed over the boy\u2019s death, including by his father, Odai Alfayoumi, who is divorced from Shaheen and was not living with them. The U.S. Department of Justice also launched a federal hate crimes investigation.",

      "However, in a ministry statement it said one-sided tariffs of up to 145% remain an obstacle, undermining trust.",
      "The statement reiterated China's stance that is open to talks, but also that Beijing is determined to fight if it must.",
      "\u201cThe tariff and trade wars were unilaterally initiated by the U.S., if the U.S. side wants to talk, it should show its sincerity, and be ready to take action on issues such as correcting wrong practices and canceling the unilateral imposition of tariffs,\u201d it said.",

      "\"At the same time, the U.S. has recently taken the initiative to convey information to the Chinese side on a number of occasions through relevant parties, hoping to talk with the Chinese side. In this regard, the Chinese side is making an assessment, it said.",

      "Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and potentially a couple thousand civilians",
      "WASHINGTON -- Detailed Army plans for a potential military parade on President Donald Trump's birthday in June call for more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The planning documents, obtained by the AP, are dated April 29 and 30 and have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Trump has long wanted but is still being discussed.",
      "The Army anniversary just happens to coincide with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday on June 14.",
      "While the slides do not include any price estimates, it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on a parade of that size. Costs would include the movement of military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made.",
      "Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, added that the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\u201d said Butler. \u201cWe want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\u201d",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely.",
      "In a Truth Social post Thursday night that did not mention the June 14 plans, Trump wrote, \u201cWe are going to start celebrating our victories again!\u201d He vowed to rename May 8, now known as Victory in Europe Day, as \u201cVictory Day for World War II,\u201d and to change November 11, Veterans Day, to \u201cVictory Day for World War I.\u201d",
      "Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve an array of activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding One.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army\u2019s 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \u201csignificant concerns regarding security requirements\u201d as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn\u2019t know if the event was being \u201ccharacterized as a military parade\u201d but added that tanks rolling through the city\u2019s streets \u201cwould not be good.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\u201d she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

      "A bill that would strip the state\u2019s largest city of power over its local water board and give more control to the governor and surrounding suburbs is heading to the governor's desk",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama legislators passed a bill on Thursday that would strip Birmingham of control over the state's largest water board and transfer power to the governor and surrounding suburbs, reigniting a decades-long, polarizing debate.",
      "Proponents of the bill point to frequent rate hikes and say that the move will prevent catastrophic events that have happened in cities like Jackson, Mississippi, or Detroit, Michigan. Opponents of the bill say that it is a power grab that diminishes the power of Black residents in Birmingham, Alabama.",
      "Birmingham city officials currently appoint six of the nine board members' seats, giving Birmingham leadership unrivaled influence over the decisions affecting the city's water. Board members approve rate hikes and manage infrastructure projects.",
      "If signed into law, SB330 would make the board just seven people. The mayor of Birmingham and the Birmingham city council would appoint two board members, while the governor, lieutenant governor and three neighboring county commission presidents would each appoint one board member.",
      "Five counties rely on the Birmingham Water Works Board, but over 40% of the utility's 770,000 customers are concentrated in the city of Birmingham, and 91% are in Jefferson County. The new system would give more weight to Birmingham's neighboring counties that house the reservoirs that supply the system.",
      "Republican lawmakers from the Birmingham suburbs sponsored the bill, saying that it will improve the efficiency of the system. They say aging infrastructure and lack of investment means residents pay for water that just gets leaked out of old pipes.",
      "\u201cSo many elected officials have been getting so many complaints, and I\u2019m sure yours have too, about the quality and the price of Birmingham water,\u201d said Republican Rep. Jim Carns, who represents Blount County, one of the places that will now appoint a board member.",
      "The water board had approximately $1 billion in debt in 2023, according to the most recent financial statements, and the board has the second highest credit score, according to bond rating agencies.",
      "Carns said that the regional board would make the utility more frugal. AL.com reported that the utility has been accused of lacking transparency in recent years and has sometimes made costly errors in distributing bills. Trust in the board was further undermined in recent years after high-profile ethics scandals.",
      "Many in Alabama\u2019s vocal Democratic minority conceded that the board wasn't perfect, but they also condemned the move as a political takeover that would wrest power from Birmingham\u2019s majority Black residents and redistribute it to customers in the city's mostly white suburbs.",
      "\u201cFrankly the language used today was insulting, with words like competence being thrown around as if the city of Birmingham is not growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d Democratic Rep. Kelvin Datcher of Birmingham said after the bill passed. He questioned how the new board's composition would address any of the bill sponsor's concerns about efficiency.",
      "Democratic legislators also took issue with the fact that they were excluded from the overall process.",
      "\u201cEach of us in this chamber would be rightfully concerned if outside representatives attempted to dictate how water systems operate in our districts without consulting us or even including us at the table, or, hell, even the room where this legislation was created,\u201d Rep. Neil Rafferty of Birmingham said.",
      "Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin joined Birmingham city council members for a press conference to echo those concerns.",
      "\u201cThe ratepayers deserve to be at the forefront of this conversation, and they have not been,\u201d Woodfin said. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is. This is a political power grab. This is not in the best interest of our citizens.\u201d",
      "The bill passed along party lines 66 to 27. It now goes to Republican Gov. Kay Ivey's desk.",

      "Alvord is located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Dallas.",

A person answering the phone at the company Thursday said they had no comment.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Republican state auditor made appointments to a new State Board of Elections on Thursday, the day after an appeals court agreed a law shifting that power otherwise held by the Democratic governor could still be enforced while the measure's constitutionality is appealed.",
      "Auditor Dave Boliek announced three members \u2014 all proposed by the state Republican Party chairman \u2014 to the five-member board.",
      "Two remain reserved for choices from the state Democratic Party, but Boliek said he had not received a slate of candidates from the Democratic chair. That is not surprising because Democrats and Stein are strongly opposed to the law finalized in December by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Stein sued to overturn the law and stop its enforcement. Trial judges just last week sided with Stein and declared that stripping him of the board appointment authority was unconstitutional.",
      "But Boliek, who was elected last fall to the post, went ahead with appointments after the intermediate-level Court of Appeals on Wednesday said the appointment switch could be carried out while broader legal questions are reviewed on appeal.",
      "Stein asked the state Supreme Court late Wednesday to suspend the unanimous ruling of the three Court of Appeals judges and keep blocking the law. The justices had not ruled on that matter as of midday Thursday.",
      "The appointments if upheld could mark a dramatic change in election administration in the battleground state. For over a century, the governor has picked the five board members, three of whom are traditionally members of the governor\u2019s party. With Boliek the auditor, Republicans would now assume a majority on the board, whose duties include carrying out campaign finance laws, certifying election results and setting rules on voting administration details.",
      "The law containing the board appointment changes said the terms of the five most recent members, which were otherwise supposed to continue until 2027, expired Wednesday and that new members would be appointed to four-year terms that would begin Thursday.",
      "Boliek's appointments are a political victory for the GOP, which since late 2016 has sought to erode or eliminate a governor\u2019s authority to appoint the board. Four previous laws targeting then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper were blocked by courts. Voters in 2018 also rejected a constitutional amendment that would have forced the governor to pick members recommended by legislative leaders.",
      "Republicans have complained that a governor has too much control over elections, resulting in one-party decision-making and a lack of voter confidence. But Democrats say the laws are a GOP power grab designed to give Republicans an unfair advantage in elections.",
      "The board\u2019s importance has been apparent in the still-unresolved November election for a state Supreme Court seat between Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs and Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, himself a Court of Appeals judge.",
      "Stein said Wednesday after the Court of Appeals ruling that he feared the appointment changes would help Republicans succeed at helping Griffin win the seat. The current tally has Riggs slightly ahead.",
      "Boliek appointed on Thursday Stacy \u201cFour\u201d Eggers, who served on the most recent board; former state Sen. Bob Rucho; and Francis De Luca, former president of a conservative think tank.",
      "\u201cWe need full confidence in our elections, and I\u2019d like to thank these individuals for their willingness to serve,\u201d Boliek said in a press release.",
      "Lawyers for Stein argue the appointment transfer unlawfully interfered with the governor\u2019s responsibility in the state constitution to take care that laws were \u201cfaithfully executed.\u201d Two of three trial judges hearing the lawsuit sided April 23 with Stein. Their order also blocked a power transfer that would direct Boliek in June to choose the chairs of county election boards. But the appeals court decision set aside that judgment.",
      "Legislative leaders said the appointments transfer was lawful, arguing the state constitution allows the General Assembly to disperse executive branch powers to carry out laws to other statewide elected officials like the auditor.",
      "The Court of Appeals ruling favoring Republican lawmakers neither provided reasons for the judges' ruling nor identified the judges who ruled. In such matters, the court releases their names after 90 days.",

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are getting their turn to question a woman who alleges the one-time Hollywood heavyweight held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her nearly two decades ago",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein \u2019s lawyers got their turn Thursday to question a woman who alleges the one-time Hollywood heavyweight held her down on a bed and forced oral sex on her nearly two decades ago.",
      "Miriam Haley, testifying for a third day at Weinstein\u2019s retrial, was grilled about her decision to hire a lawyer and go public with her allegations as the #MeToo movement exploded in October 2017.",
      "Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean sparred with Haley over the details of her early statements to the press about the alleged assault, getting her to admit that she didn't give interviewers back then a full picture of her relationship with Weinstein.",
      "Haley denied Bonjean\u2019s suggestion that she went public in hopes of suing Weinstein, but acknowledged she later filed a lawsuit and received a settlement of about $475,000.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone. His lawyers have argued that all of his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "Haley, the first of three accusers expected to testify, said Wednesday that she maintained contact with Weinstein for more than a year after the alleged assault she says happened at his Manhattan apartment in July 2006.",
      "Haley testified that she flew to Los Angeles on Weinstein\u2019s dime a day after the alleged assault, and a few weeks later agreed to meet him at a Manhattan hotel. She said she had expected to talk in the lobby, but was instead directed to his room, where he pulled her into bed for sex.",
      "Even after that, Haley testified, she kept in touch \u2014 sometimes calling Weinstein and sending emails signed \u201cLots of love\u201d to him and his assistant over the next few months and years. She insisted she was looking for professional opportunity and was never interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with him.",
      "Bonjean pointed out Thursday that when Haley went public, she didn\u2019t mention her subsequent sexual encounter with Weinstein, nor their continued contact.",
      "\u201cYou told the press only part of the story, correct?\u201d Bonjean asked.",
      "\u201cI told the part that was relevant to what I was trying to share,\u201d Haley said.",
      "Bonjean noted that Haley didn't report her allegations to police until June 2018, but held a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred just days after she first saw media reports about other women accusing Weinstein of wrongdoing.",
      "Bonjean asked if Haley had been \u201ctrying to send a message to\u201d Weinstein.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t really thinking about Mr. Weinstein in that press conference,\u201d Haley responded, adding that she spoke out to support other accusers who had also done so.",
      "Bonjean will step away from Weinstein\u2019s defense team after she finishes questioning Haley. Another case Bonjean is working on is going to trial in Brooklyn next week.",
      "On Wednesday, under questioning by a prosecutor, Haley recalled the alleged 2006 assault as a friendly, professional meeting at Weinstein\u2019s apartment that he turned into \u201cthe unthinkable.\u201d She said he ignored her pleas of: \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she felt shocked, disgusted and humiliated. She and two of her friends testified that she soon told them that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is the first of Weinstein\u2019s accusers to testify at his rape retrial. She is reprising her testimony from his first trial in 2020 after his conviction was overturned last year, albeit with some details that weren\u2019t heard before.",
      "On Wednesday, she recalled Weinstein had asked her, \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re much closer now?\u201d after either the alleged assault or a subsequent occasion when she says she had unwanted, but not forced, sex with him.",
      "Haley was briefly a production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway\u201d and had a series of interactions with him that were sometimes inappropriate and suggestive, but other times professional and polite, she told jurors.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial includes charges related to Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann. Mann alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013. He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California \u2019s population climbed above 39.5 million in 2024, marking the second year of growth following a string of declines in the nation\u2019s most populous state during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The population rose an estimated 1%, adding 108,000 people compared to 2023, according to a report released Thursday by the Department of Finance. The increase is due in part to the number of births outpacing deaths and a boost in the number of adults 65 and older. The state said it also had better data to account for increases in legal immigration into the state from other countries.",
      "About one in nine people living in the United States reside in California.",
      "The Democratic governor touted the population gains as a sign of the state\u2019s growing economy, which is one of the largest in the world. The size of the state's economy has now surpassed that of Japan, which puts it only behind the U.S. as a whole, China and Germany, Newsom's office announced last week.",
      "\u201cPeople from across the nation and the globe are coming to the Golden State to pursue the California Dream, where rights are protected and people are respected,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cRegions throughout California are growing, strengthening local communities and boosting our state\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "But Republicans in the Democrat-dominated state and beyond have taken aim at California's population declines in the past and the loss of its residents to Texas, which previously made up the largest state-to-state movement in the U.S., according to U.S. Census data.",
      "Critics have tied past population decreases in the Golden State to the relentless homelessness crisis and rising cost of living. California has some of the highest housing, gas and utility prices in the country.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are still leaving because of high costs, bad policies, and a government that punishes work and rewards dysfunction,\" Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher said. \"If the Governor thinks a one-year bump means the state\u2019s doing fine, he\u2019s ignoring the reality most families are living in.\u201d",
      "Eric McGhee, a policy director and senior fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said the period of decline was significant because prior to it, \u201cin our entire existence as a state, we had never lost population before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were often one of the fastest-growing states,\" he said. \"So it was unusual for us to be losing population, to say the least.\u201d",
      "The growth California saw in 2024 \"is still very modest,\" McGhee said.",
      "The state also revised its estimate for legal immigration into California from other countries from 2021 to 2024 by roughly 277,000 people, citing better data. The estimated total number of legal immigrants during that period now stands at about 655,000, the Department of Finance said.",
      "Seven of the 10 largest cities saw an increase in population in 2024, including Bakersfield and San Diego, which both grew by more than 1% to roughly 419,000 and 1.4 million, respectively. San Francisco, San Jose and Anaheim saw decreases in population by less than 0.5%.",
      "The population rose in nine of the 10 largest counties, with Los Angeles County increasing by 28,000 compared to 2023. In Contra Costa, the state\u2019s ninth most populous county that is part of the San Francisco Bay Area, the number of residents fell by just two dozen.",
      "In Mono, a small county on the California-Nevada border around Yosemite National Park, the population growth rate fell by about 1.6%.",

      "The Trump administration is calling for more reliance on behavioral therapy for transgender youth instead of broader gender-affirming medical care",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration released a lengthy review of transgender health care on Thursday that advocates for a greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming medical care for youths with gender dysmorphia.",
      "The Health and Human Services report questions standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and is likely to be used to bolster the government\u2019s abrupt shift in how to care for a subset of the population that has become a political lightning rod.",
      "This new \u201cbest practices\u201d report is in response to an executive order Trump issued days into his second term that says the federal government must not support gender transitions for anyone under age 19.",
      "\u201cOur duty is to protect our nation\u2019s children \u2014 not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\u201d National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a statement. \u201cWe must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\u201d",
      "HHS said its report, however, is not clinical guidance and does not make any policy recommendations. The report is also limited to children and does not address treatment for adults.",
      "Gender-affirming care for transgender youth under standards widely used in the U.S. includes supportive talk therapy and can \u2014 but does not always \u2014 involve puberty blockers or hormone treatment. Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender minors are rare.",
      "A judge has blocked key parts of Trump\u2019s order, which includes denying research and educational grants for medical schools, hospitals and other institutions that provide gender-affirming care to people 18 or younger. Several hospitals around the country ceased providing care. The White House said Monday that since Trump took office, HHS has eliminated 215 grants totaling $477 million for research or education on gender-affirming treatment.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have also adopted bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling is pending after justices heard arguments in December in a case about whether states can enforce such laws.",
      "The Jan. 28 executive order is among several administration policies aimed at denying the existence of transgender people. Trump also has ordered the government to identify people as either male or female rather than accept a concept of gender in which people fall along a spectrum, remove transgender service members from the military, and bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions that align with their gender. This month, HHS issued guidance to protect whistleblowers who report doctors or hospitals providing gender-affirming care. Judges are blocking enforcement of several of the policies.",
      "This latest HHS report, which Trump called for while campaigning last year, represents a reversal in federal policy. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, found that no research had determined that behavioral health interventions could change someone\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation. The 2023 update to the 2015 finding is no longer on the agency\u2019s website.",
      "The administration says this new report will go through a peer-review process. In the meantime, it\u2019s not saying who contributed to it, \u201cin order to help maintain the integrity of this process.\u201d",
      "The report says that medical groups have relied on medical treatment rather than behavioral therapy for transgender youth partly because of a \u201cmischaracterization of such approaches as \u2018conversion therapy,\u2019\u201d which about half the states have banned for minors.",
      "The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has said that evidence shows conversion therapies inflict harm on young people, including elevated rates of suicidal ideation. And the American Medical Association has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that \u201cempirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. defense officials say the number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year and there was a significant drop in the Army",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of sexual assaults reported across the U.S. military dipped by nearly 4% last year, fueled by a significant drop in the Army, The Associated Press has learned. It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.",
      "Senior U.S. defense officials said that while the decline is a good sign, the number of reported assaults is still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.",
      "According to the officials, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been publicly released.",
      "According to data obtained by the AP, the overall decrease was due to a 13% drop in reported sexual assaults across the Army, which is the largest military service.",
      "All the other services saw increases. The Navy had the largest jump of 4.3%, while the Air Force had a 2.2% increase and the Marine Corps rose by less than 1%.",
      "Of the 8,195 total, there were 512 service members who reported an assault that happened before they entered the military. The Pentagon encourages reporting so that victims can get any support they need. In addition, 641 were civilians who said they were assaulted by a member of the military.",
      "While reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.",
      "The latest report also reflects the first full year since new prosecution procedures have been in place, putting independent lawyers in charge of those decisions and sidelining commanders after years of pressure from Congress.",
      "The change, long resisted by Pentagon leaders, was finally forced by frustrated lawmakers who believed that too often commanders would fail to take victims\u2019 complaints seriously or would try to protect alleged perpetrators in their units.",
      "Officials said it is too soon to tell what effect those changes are having on the prosecution process.",
      "The number of cases in which misconduct was substantiated increased a bit last year over the 2023 total. The number of discharges and administrative actions against alleged perpetrators continued to increase, and court-martial charges declined \u2014 both trends going back several years.",
      "Officials noted that nearly three-quarters of the court-martial cases ended in convictions, a slight increase over the previous year.",
      "Sexual assault reports in the military have gone up for much of the past decade, except for a tiny decrease in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Officials say they are optimistic about the recent decreases but say much more work needs to be done.",
      "While it is difficult to point to any one reason for the two-year decline, the Defense Department has been making a series of changes over the past year that officials say may be contributing to the shift. The services are using an infusion of more than $1 billion to improve programs and hire up to 2,500 personnel as part of a new \u201cprevention workforce\u201d and place them at military installations around the world.",
      "So far, about 1,400 have been hired for that work, but that process has stalled this year due to the Trump administration\u2019s budget and personnel cuts across the federal government. Defense officials said they are working to spread the existing workers around to lessen the gaps until more can be hired.",
      "The Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That survey, which is conducted online, came out last year, so it was not done this year.",
      "Last year\u2019s survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.",
      "But officials said the survey also indicates that a large number of service members never file a report.",
      "Defense officials have long argued that an increase in reported assaults is a positive trend because so many people are reluctant to report them, both in the military and in society as a whole. Greater reporting, they say, shows there is more confidence in the reporting system and greater comfort with the support for victims.",

    "story": [
      "Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.",
      "The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.",
      "Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.",
      "\"All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "\"The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,\" it added.",
      "Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (\u00a3600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.",
      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they would make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",
      "\"These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,\" it added.",

      "The rise and rise of fashion giant Shein",
      "The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop \"abuse\" of the exemption.",
      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",

      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "\"Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun.\"",

      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the sector, looking at whether a lack of competition in the sector has contributed to soaring prices.",

      "In a list of potential remedies, the CMA said vets could be forced to create a clear online display of prices for medicines, surgeries, treatments and out-of-hours help. The working paper also suggested that the mark-up charged on pet cremations, sold to customers at a \"vulnerable moment\", might be capped.",
      "The watchdog has also suggested a comparison website making it compulsory for clinics to inform owners if cheaper options are available.",

      "They are CVS, Independent Vetcare Ltd, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners.",
      "Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices.",
      "While most of the bigger groups own their practices outright, Pets at Home told the watchdog that the majority that it runs are 50-50 joint ventures with individual owners who are vets, nurses or practice managers."

      "Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",

It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.",

      "Trump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic.",

      "The BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.",
      "When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",
      "Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.",
      "Opportunities beyond America",
      "The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.",
      "Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.",

      "The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",
      "The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.",

      "This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.",
      "It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.",
      "Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.",
      "The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.",
      "\"Overall, not as bad as feared,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",

      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",
      "If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.",

      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",
      "It's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.",
      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",
      "\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"",
      "But he says he bears no anger anymore.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n8r38rdlo",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 23:06:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "House prices fell in April as buyers faced paying thousands of pounds more in stamp duty, according to new figures from Nationwide.",
      "Prices were down 0.6% month-on-month, the building society said.",
      "The slowdown in the market was expected due to changes to stamp duty thresholds kicking in on 1 April.",
      "Annual house price growth also slowed, but homes remain 3.4% more expensive  than they were a year ago, with the average price now at \u00a3270,752.",
      "Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said there was a \"significant jump\" in transactions in March, with buyers bringing forward purchases to avoid the additional tax charges.",
      "\"The market is likely to remain a little soft in the coming months,\" he said.",
      "But Mr Gardner added buying was likely to pick up as over summer due to earnings rising and the expectation of further cuts to interest rates.",
      "Mortgages under 4% are back but dangers lurk for borrowers",
      "What is stamp duty and how is it changing?",
      "In her October Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the government had decided to lower stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "The changes, which came into effect in April, means house buyers now pay the tax on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000, as was the case previously.",
      "First-time buyers will also now have to pay stamp duty on homes costing more than \u00a3300,000, whereas before the April change, they did not have to pay the charge unless the property was above \u00a3425,000.",
      "Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.",
      "April's drop in house prices was the biggest monthly fall since August 2023, according to UK economist Ashley Webb from Capital Economics.",
      "He said that the easing of mortgage rates would help boost housing demand in the coming months, offsetting any tightening in spending as a result of higher prices potentially caused by US president Donald Trump's trade tariffs.",
      "Mr Webb added that house prices are predicted to rise by 3.5% this year, and 4.5% in 2026.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit.",
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "Recent figures suggested that more low-deposit mortgages at 5% or 10% are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "Expectations are growing that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. That, in turn, could lower mortgage costs.",
      "\"With the anticipation of further rate cuts and mortgage provider competition, we expect to see the market accelerate through the gears over the remainder of the year,\" said Jean Jameson, from estate agent Foxtons."

      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",
      "This week, Kneecap's album entered the iTunes chart in Italy, Brazil and Germany for the first time.",

    "summary": "As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "Almost \u00a3100m was invested into improving maternity safety annually following the publication of an interim report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. But changes by the Department of Health mean that just \u00a32m of the funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year.",
      "Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter due to poor care at the trust, called the decision \"an absolute betrayal by Wes Streeting\".",
      "The Department of Health said local health leaders would be given the money to decide how best to spend it.",
      "The Royal College of Midwives described the funding decision as taking \"a wrecking ball\" to maternity safety.",
      "'Short-sighted'",
      "The review into maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust, published in 2022, found that at least 201 babies and nine mothers could have survived with better care.",
      "Following the publication of an interim report, in March 2021, NHS England said it would increase spending on maternity care by \u00a395m a year.",
      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",
      "But analysis of NHS funding for this year, carried out by the Health Service Journal, showed that just \u00a32m of the \u00a395m was to be ringfenced for 2025/26.",
      "The rest of the money will be given to the 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) that decide how the health service funding is allocated locally across England.",
      "Responding to the change, Ms Ockenden posted on social media: \"How has this happened? So disappointed. Talking to colleagues across perinatal services, the sense of disappointment is profound.\"",
      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",
      "But some maternity staff have labelled the change as disastrous, fearing that taking away the funding protection will mean maternity budgets will be cut.",
      "\"Removing the ringfencing will take us back years,\" said a senior midwife.",
      "The Royal College of Midwives said it was \"utterly shocked\" by Streeting's decision, adding it was \"short-sighted\" and \"utterly unacceptable\".",
      "\"These budget cuts\u2026 will rip the heart out of any moves to improve maternity safety,\" said chief executive Gill Walton.",
      "\"The government has taken a wrecking ball to the work that's being done up and down the country to improve maternity safety, something which is desperately needed.\"",
      "'More flexibility'",
      "Rhiannon Davies, who alongside Kayleigh Griffiths was instrumental in getting the Shrewsbury inquiry commissioned, was also strongly critical of the health secretary.",
      "The money, she wrote, \"was to ensure others avoided the lifelong pain we have to endure without our children\".",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said maternity care remained a top priority for the health service.",

    "story": [
      "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.",
      "Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.",
      "It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.",
      "\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"",
      "Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\".",
      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",

      "A proposed trial to install a waste needle bin in Belfast city centre is not a \"silver bullet\" but one step to dealing with drugs issues in the city, a councillor has said.",
      "Brian Smyth was speaking ahead of a Belfast City Council vote on Thursday in favour of installing the bin in the council-owned car park on Little Donegall Street.",
      "Councillors chose the car park over a site on Corporation Square at the People and Communities Committee last month.",
      "Green Party representative Smyth said the council was lifting between 600 and 700 needles a month in the city centre, with other organisations also involved in the collection of needles.",
      "A council report stated there had been an increase in needle finds in recent months and it had been \"highlighted as being in the top six locations\" for discarded needles.",
      "The proposed metal needle bin will be concreted to the ground and will provide a secure way of disposing of sharps.",
      "Smyth had previously tabled motions for similar bins to be placed in Writer's Square, however this is not council land.",
      "He said the Department for Communities (DfC) had turned down this call.",
      "\"They are worried about image but I would say if needles continue to be found in the area of high significance, then that's going to provide an image problem,\" he said.",

      "Needles found in rubbish",
      "Smyth said members of the council's cleansing team had found needles disposed in regular rubbish bins.",
      "\"This poses a risk not only to them but also to members of the public,\" he said.",
      "\"Whilst this is a very small response, I think we need to get our heads around the bigger issue of rising drug use in and around Belfast city centre and how we tackle it.\"",
      "In March 2023, Belfast City councillors passed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facility to help prevent overdoses among drug users.",
      "The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen.",
      "The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.",
      "Smyth said such a facility could make the area safe for \"people who live, work and socialise in the city centre\".",
      "Damian McNairney, a volunteer and trustee from The People's Kitchen in Belfast, said the bin would help but described Belfast city centre as being in a drug crisis.",
      "The kitchen offers support to vulnerable and homeless people.",
      "\"We need to be more adventurous, we need to be more compassionate in our approach to the issue,\" said Mr McNairney.",
      "\"Addicts are being demonised, we need to look and see if we can help.",
      "\"If we solve the problem at source, i.e. the addiction, then we are going to be able to deal with the drug paraphernalia and the other issues allied to that.\"",
      "Mr McNairney said there were other areas with \"more prominent use\" but getting needles off the street was always a positive.",
      "\"There are needles around the town anyway. By not putting the bins up they're not going to go away,\" he said.",
      "Mr McNairney said he had visited a safe injection site which opened in Dublin in 2024 and he was in favour of a similar facility in Belfast.",
      "\"It seems to be very encouraging in terms of people using it, there's drug paraphernalia that has been taken off the streets, it's being safely disposed of and people with addictions are being signposted to other services,\" he said.",
      "In March, Justice Minister Naomi Long told BBC News NI that the \"war on drugs had not been won\" and there needed to be a rethink of how illegal drugs were dealt with in Northern Ireland.",
      "Martina Connolly, CEO of Belfast One Business Improvement District (BID), said she believed it was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "\"The presence of discarded needles is a serious concern for businesses, residents, and visitors alike, and we recognise the urgent need for practical measures,\" she said.",
      "\"We acknowledge that this is a complex challenge, rooted in broader issues of mental health and addiction, which require a compassionate and multi-agency response.\"",

      "A sharps disposal \u2013 or needle \u2013 bin is a type of container that is specially designed for the safe disposal of sharp medical waste, such as needles and syringes.",
      "After a needle has been used, it can carry bodily fluids, such as blood, which could pass an infection on to other people.",
      "Proper disposal is important for public safety, disease prevention, and environmental protection, according to the NHS.",
      "In a report Belfast City Council said: \"Monitoring and disposing of any discarded sharps will be managed within the existing budgets of operational teams involved in needle disposal.\"",

      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",

    "story": [
      "The overnight results from Thursday's elections have confirmed the message of the polls that Reform are posing a major challenge to the traditional dominance of British politics enjoyed by the Conservatives and Labour.",
      "The party won the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, just managing to overturn a 35-point Labour majority.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory minister, has convincingly won the new position of Mayor of Greater Lincolnshire. However, the party will be disappointed at narrowly losing out to Labour in the contests in Doncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England.",

      "Reform wins Runcorn by-election by just six votes and gains first mayor",
      "The party won 39% of the vote in the results declared so far, enough to put it well ahead of all if its rivals. And Reform also seems to have a good chance of winning overall control of both Lincolnshire and Staffordshire, both of which voted heavily for Brexit in 2016.",
      "It is the first time an anti-EU party has won a by-election afresh. Until now the only by-elections won by an anti-EU party were two contests in 2014 when the local Tory MP stood down and fought the subsequent by-election under UKIP's colours.",
      "Reform's seat gains have primarily been at the expense of the Conservatives. That was inevitable, given the party previously held nearly a thousand of the 1,641 seats up for grabs.",
      "Nevertheless, the party will be deeply troubled at suffering a drubbing every bit as severe as the one it suffered in last year's general election.",
      "On average its vote was down by 25 points since the last time these seats were fought in May 2021, falling most heavily where Reform did best. The party has so far lost more than half the seats it is trying to defend.",
      "But if the results will likely intensify the debate about how the Conservatives should respond to the challenge from Reform, they also underline the message from the polls that support for Labour has fallen heavily since the general election.",
      "Its three mayoral successes were all won on a significantly diminished share of the vote.",
      "It is Labour's good fortune that it is defending fewer than 300 seats in the local council elections. Even so, and in contrast to the mayoral outcomes, the party has so far lost over half the seats it was trying to defend, mostly to Reform. Their vote is on average down on a poor performance in 2021 by as much as nine points.",
      "Most of the hopes the Liberal Democrats and the Greens have for these elections are concentrated in the local council declarations later today. The overnight results suggest both parties are heading for a similar level of support as four years ago.",
      "However, the Greens will be disappointed that their hopes of edging ahead of Labour in the race for West of England mayor were dashed, with the party finding itself instead trailing Reform in third place.",

      "She beat the Conservative candidate by more than 40,000 votes, which will feel like like a personal vindication for the former Tory MP.",

      "Shock election triumph",
      "It all started in 2009, when she won a seat on Lincolnshire County Council, narrowly defeating the far-right British National Party's candidate.",
      "The result did not stand for long though. She was forced to resign after it emerged her part-time job as a music tutor for a council-run music service made her ineligible to run as a candidate.",
      "A by-election was held and Jenkyns squeaked home by 16 votes, again ahead of the BNP.",
      "Four years on, she lost her council seat to UKIP, a Eurosceptic party founded by Nigel Farage - Reform UK's leader and, ironically, now Dame Andrea's boss.",
      "Two years passed before her next comeback in 2015, when she burst onto the national scene with one of the biggest shocks of the general election that year.",
      "She ousted shadow chancellor Ed Balls, winning the Morley and Outwood constituency by 422 votes and knocking a brick out of Labour's red wall.",
      "Jenkyns - who worked at a Greggs bakery after leaving school at 16 - said she was \"lost for words\".",
      "In her campaign, she presented herself as a \"strong Yorkshire lass\" from humble beginnings.",
      "Born in Humberside in 1974, Jenkyns went straight into a job after finishing school, working her way up from a Saturday shop assistant to senior management.",
      "An amateur opera singer and a vocal coach, she also worked as a music tutor in secondary schools.",
      "When she hit her 30s, she decided to retrain and completed a diploma in economics from the Open University before graduating from the University of Lincoln aged 40 after studying international relations and politics.",
      "Her father was a lorry driver with his own haulage business.",
      "He pushed her towards the limelight at an early age, entering her in the Miss UK beauty contest.",
      "\"My dad sent my photo off without telling me and I ended up getting into the final,\" she told the Express newspaper.",
      "\"It was an interesting moment.\"",
      "Her father's death in 2011 - after he contracted the MRSA infection in hospital - spurred her to run for Parliament.",
      "Brexit backer",
      "As an MP, Jenkyns was a passionate Brexit backer and a strong critic of Theresa May's handling of the UK's departure from the EU when she was prime minister.",
      "In a striking intervention at Prime Minister's Questions, Jenkyns said May had \"failed to deliver on her promises\" and suggested she should resign.",
      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",
      "When Johnson resigned in 2022, Jenkyns lost her composure outside Downing Street.",
      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",
      "A backlash followed and in her defence, Jenkyns said she was \"only human\" and had received \"huge amounts of abuse from some of the people who were there over the years\".",
      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",
      "Jenkyns retained her ministerial role under Liz Truss but was later dismissed by the following prime minister, Rishi Sunak.",
      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",
      "Dame Andrea had made clear her sympathies with Nigel Farage's party, urging the Conservatives to unite with it to prevent a Labour \"supermajority\" at the general election.",
      "Attending Reform UK's conference last autumn, Dame Andrea insisted she was \"not defecting\" but was keen to find out whether Farage's party was \"the true home of conservatism\".",
      "Two months later, Jenkyns announced she was officially joining Reform UK and would stand as the party's candidate to be mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.",
      "Dame Andrea said she had \"fought to the bitter end\" but the Conservative Party was now \"beyond salvage\".",
      "Twelve years on from her defeat to Farage's former party in a local election in Lincolnshire, Jenkyns has delivered a significant electoral victory for her former foe.",

      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",

      "Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline.",
      "Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low.",
      "The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague has ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was \"discriminatory and disproportionate\", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark.",

      "Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\"",

      "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\".",
      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",

      "\"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The Scottish government has confirmed it will not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A bill has long been promised to improve protections for women and girls, but ministers now say there is not enough time to draw up a law which reflects the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.",
      "They are instead going to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government has also confirmed it will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term, and is hoping for a UK-wide solution.",
      "A new misogyny law was promised after an expert group in 2022 backed separate legislation rather than incorporating abuse and violence against women into Scotland's hate crime law.",
      "The group, led by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, said this was a better option because women are not a minority, and a \"more fundamental set of responses\" were required to address the \"deeply rooted\" problem.",
      "The Scottish government proposed creating five new offences in its Misogyny Bill including stirring up hatred against women and misogynistic harassment.",
      "Misogyny would also be treated as an aggravating factor in crimes, which could lead to tougher sentencing.",
      "QC shocked by level of misogyny in Scotland",
      "Why are women not protected by new hate crime law?",
      "The Scottish government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse but it was a \"complex area of policy and law\" which required more time to work out where it would apply.",
      "This would include assessing the implications of the recent Supreme Court judgement that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of equality legislation, it said.",
      "It said there was insufficient time to proceed with the bill in this parliamentary session, but in September it would add the protected characteristic of sex to Scotland's hate crime act.",
      "First Minister John Swinney said: \"We have to navigate a way through all of the issues that come out of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"What action we can take is action we can take during this parliamentary term to tackle misogyny and that's what the government will do\".",
      "Conversion therapy",
      "The Scottish government said it was also dropping plans for a new law banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Both pieces of legislation were part of the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens which ended in April last year.",
      "Ministers previously said Scotland wanted to lead the way in outlawing such practices - but it has now urged the Labour government at Westminster to legislate on the issue.",
      "Equalities Minister Kaukab Stewart said if an approach covering Scotland, England and Wales could not be agreed, the Scottish government would introduce its own law within a year if it remained in power after next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A joint statement from Scottish LGBTQIA+ organisations said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to see an end to conversion practices would not proceed - and that the community had felt rights were being \"rolled back and reduced\" for a long time.",
      "The statement said: \"Simply put, the longer it takes to legislate to end conversion practices the more harm will be done, including to those most vulnerable.",
      "\"The failure to progress this bill is yet another blow to our community's faith in government and the institutions that are meant to represent and protect us.\"",
      "Publishing this news in a written question on a Friday morning after elections down south is a classic attempt from the Scottish government to bury some bad news.",
      "In fairness, it is true to say that drawing up complicated legislation before the ink is even dry on a relevant Supreme Court's ruling would be a challenge in the remaining year of the Holyrood term.",
      "But a bill can pass in a matter of days if the political will is there.",
      "And women's groups are already deeply suspicious of the government, given it has spent the last few years engaged in court battle with campaigners about fundamental definitions.",
      "Ministers will point to the move to beef up hate crime law as evidence they are taking action on behalf of women and girls - despite the fact they were originally omitted from that bill with the promise of bespoke legislation.",
      "The point of this move is to get some awkward issues out of the way before John Swinney makes his programme for government speech next week about what he is  planning on doing for the rest of the Holyrood term.",
      "But for all he is keen to get away from spiky debates around gender politics - and you can read the shelving of the conversion therapy ban as part of that too - he is still going to face plenty of questions about this.",
      "Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton MSP said the misogyny bill was the latest in a \"litany of paused, ditched or botched\" policies from Nicola Sturgeon's time as first minister.",
      "She said: \"Misogyny remains a serious problem and it's crucial that women and girls are protected from all forms of threatening and abusive behaviour in a way that safeguards their rights.\"",
      "Scottish Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine MP said: \"This is the wrong thing to do.",
      "\"The proposed legislation was a chance to substantially improve protections, help change culture and behaviours and move us closer to eradicating misogyny.\"",
      "'Screeching U-turn'",
      "Scottish Labour justice spokesperson Pauline McNeill said \"This is a shameful broken promise to Scottish women at a time when misogynistic hatred is on the rise.",
      "\"The SNP has spent years kicking this issue into the long grass by insisting this approach wouldn't work, only to perform a screeching U-turn.",
      "The Scottish Greens said dropping the two bills was a \"shameful backward step\".",
      "The party's equalities spokesperson Maggie Chapman said: \"The misogyny bill was a vital step in ensuring that reports of harassment and assault are taken seriously.",

      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",

      "The justice secretary has said it is \"absolutely unacceptable\" to question the validity of the Supreme Court after it ruled that the term \"woman\" is defined by biological sex.",
      "Speaking to Parliament's Human Rights Joint Committee,  Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court \"provided the legal clarity in their legal decision which is exactly their job\".",
      "The decision was seen as a victory by women's rights groups but some trans campaigners have argued it did not take into account their view of the complexities of biology and a transgender former judge says she plans to bring an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .",

      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "Trans former judge plans to challenge gender ruling at European court",
      "Equality watchdog issues interim guidance on single-sex spaces",
      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",
      "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission also published interim guidance after the ruling which said trans women \"should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\" in workplaces or public-facing services.  The same applies to trans men, who are biologically female.",
      "But it said that trans people \"should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use\".",

      "Dr McCloud, who stepped down from a High Court role last year, said the Supreme Court judgement and equality watchdog's new guidance violated her human rights and she felt \"contained and segregated\".",
      "She said the ruling had failed to consider human rights arguments that would have been put by trans people and the judgement had left her with the legal \"nonsense\" of being \"two sexes at once\".",
      "Some trans campaigners have expressed disappointment at the ruling. They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",
      "In her evidence, to the Human Rights Joint Committee, the justice secretary also addressed the government's policy on transgender prisoners.",
      "Mahmood said it \"strikes the right balance\" but \"we will obviously now go back and with the clarity from the Supreme Court just make sure that that policy still stands to scrutiny or whether we need to make any changes\".",
      "The justice secretary said the vast majority of trans women inmates are within the male estate, and she had not moved any trans prisoners into women's jails since taking office last July.",
      "Prison service data for 2023-24 shows there were 295 transgender prisoners in England and Wales, with 51 in female prisons and 244 in male prisons.",

      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",

      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",

      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",

      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

      "Whether they spill over into 'clear red water' - a phrase coined at the start of the century to describe how the Welsh party differentiated itself from its Westminster colleagues - remains to be seen.",
      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon BBC Wales saw a copy of a letter the FM has sent to the business secretary in Westminster outlining her concerns about the steel industry.",
      "Eluned Morgan is calling on Jonathan Reynolds to \"ringfence\" a significant amount of a \u00a32.5bn UK government steel fund for Wales.",
      "There are worries that the money will be used to keep the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe \u2013 rescued by the UK government \u2013 burning instead.",

      "Tata -the owners of Port Talbot \u2013 are investing in a joint venture with the UK government to build a new electric arc furnace there.",
      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",

      "FM criticises UK minister for saying she backs cuts",

      "Some Labour MSs have already made their feelings clear on welfare reform.",
      "A minister \u2013 Jane Hutt \u2013 said that she had \"strongly\" complained about the \"adverse impact\" of the Westminster decision not to scrap the two-child limit for certain benefits.",
      "The first minister herself has made a veiled objection to comments from her Labour colleague, the Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens, that she had welcomed the reforms.",
      "When Eluned Morgan took over as FM last year a couple of her colleagues suggested to me that she might need a \"row\" \u2013 concocted or otherwise - with UK Labour, to bolster her position.",
      "When she makes her speech next week, will that time have come?",
      "If Morgan does sharpen up her language and criticism of UK Labour's approach, there would still be a risk for her.",

      "As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest.",
      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",
      "We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.",
      "There are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.",
      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",
      "\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure.",
      "\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"",

      "A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge.",
      "But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito.",
      "The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date.",
      "More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem.",
      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
      "Midge bite or a mosquito?",
      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

      "The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place and gave evidence in the court hearing.",
      "Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: \"We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound.\"",
      "\"Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery.\"",
      "The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) welcomed the court's decision and said it had found \"the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science\".",
      "Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production.",
      "Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was \"unnecessary\" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence.",
      "Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a \"massive impact\" on the industry.",
      "\"It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,\" he said.",
      "Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat.",
      "\"Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,\" he added.",
      "The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuing concerns about the seabird population.",
      "Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: \"Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it.",
      "\"The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that.\"",
      "The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was \"disproportionate\".",
      "A Defra spokesperson said it would \"bring the UK into compliance\" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",

      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",

      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",

      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",

      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",

      "This meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.",
      "\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.",
      "\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"",

      "At the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.",

    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",

      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "The three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.",
      "But it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.",
      "The video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.",
      "Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.",
      "Meanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.",
      "When BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.",
      "Fadi, the nomad smuggler",
      "Fadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.",
      "Pakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.",
      "But Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.",
      "His current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.",
      "One other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.",
      "Since 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.",
      "The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.",
      "Many Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.",
      "These migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).",
      "There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.",
      "Gujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.",
      "Multiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.",
      "Further clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.",
      "Videos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.",
      "Backtracking on promises",
      "One survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.",
      "But when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.",
      "\"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\"",

      "One person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.",

      "Survivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.",

      "Uzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\".",
      "According to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.",
      "\"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\"",
      "Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.",
      "Others died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.",
      "Those still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.",

      "\"The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order,\" the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement.",
      "The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.",
      "The parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.",
      "AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was \"clearly politically motivated\" and a \"severe blow to German democracy\". They argued their party was being \"discredited and criminalised\" shortly before the change of government.",
      "The far-right AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany, and the intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest.",
      "The agency, or Verfassungschutz, said specifically that the AfD did not consider citizens of a \"migration background from predominantly Muslim countries\" as equal members of the German people.",
      "AfD deputy chairman Stephan Brandner said the decision was \"complete nonsense, has absolutely nothing to do with law and order\".",
      "However, acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the agency had made a clear and unambiguous decision with \"no political influence whatsoever\", after a comprehensive review and a report of 1,100 pages.",
      "Bundestag Vice-President Andrea Lindholz said that as a designated right-wing extremist group the AfD should not be treated as other parties, especially in parliament.",
      "Because of their large number of seats, AfD members could be eligible to chair parliamentary committees, but Lindholz said that idea was now \"almost unthinkable\".",

      "Earlier this year Alice Weidel embraced the term \"remigration\", widely seen as meaning the mass deportation of people with a migrant background, although she rejected that definition.",
      "The AfD also attracted the support of leading figures in the Trump administration. Nine days before the election, US Vice-President JD Vance met Weidel in Munich and said there was no place for \"firewalls\", alleging that free speech was in retreat in Europe.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk gave Weidel a long audience in a livestreamed chat on X and called on Germans to vote for the AfD. He then repeatedly posted his support for Weidel's party in the run-up to the vote.",
      "Germany's domestic intelligence agency is responsible for both counter-intelligence and investigating terror threats.",
      "Although its change in designation of the AfD is expected to be challenged in the courts, it would likely lower the threshold for the agency using informants and surveillance in monitoring the party.",
      "Some German politicians have said the party's new designation should lead to a ban.",
      "Under Germany's Basic Law - a constitution adopted in 1949 four years after the fall of Hitler's Nazi regime - parties that \"deliberately undermine the functioning of Germany's free democratic basic order\" can be banned if they act in a \"militant and aggressive way\".",
      "Domestic intelligence cannot push for a ban on the party - that can only go through the two houses of parliament, government or the constitutional court - but its latest decision could encourage others to start the process.",
      "Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against rushing into a decision, but Heidi Reichinnek of the Left Party said no-one could accept that \"a proven right-wing extremist party is fighting and destroying our democracy from within\".",
      "Since the war, the constitutional court has banned only two parties, both in the 1950s.",
      "The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD, Serpil Midyatli, said it was now in black and white what everybody already knew. \"It's clear for me that the ban has to come,\" she said, according to German press agency dpa.",

      "The mother of a South African girl, who disappeared aged six more than a year ago, has been convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter.",
      "Kelly Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn were arrested after Smith's daughter, Joshlin, went missing from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, in February last year.",
      "Appollis and Van Rhyn were also found guilty on Friday of kidnapping and trafficking Joshlin. All three had previously pleaded not guilty to to these charges.",

      "Smith wiped tears from her eyes when the guilty verdict was read, while Van Rhyn inexplicably broke into a smile.",
      "Applause rippled through the packed courtroom and some onlookers began to cry.",
      "Smith's mother was in attendance and after the hearing finished, she said she was \"angry\" with her daughter and did not want to see her.",

      "The \"person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin\", Ms Lombaard told the court.",
      "A local pastor testified that in 2023, he had heard Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; \u00a3850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.",
      "Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already \"on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa\".",
      "Smith's lawyer, Rinesh Sivnarain, cast doubt on these allegations. He cited inconsistencies - recognised by the prosecution - in Ms Lombaard's remarks and suggested she was an \"opportunist\".",
      "Smith, Appollis and Van Rhyn chose not to call any witnesses in their defence and did not take the stand during the trial.",

      "Some charlatans are involved in unscrupulous traditional so-called cures, and have been known to sell good luck charms that involve body parts.",
      "The allegation that Smith had discussed selling her daughter and had issues with drugs has prompted conversations about the vulnerability of children, particularly in South Africa's poor communities.",

    "summary": "Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in Australia's poll - but the US president has changed that.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Katy read this article",
      "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.",
      "People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.",
      "In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.",
      "\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''",
      "Other spectators are more nuanced.",
      "\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"",
      "Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.",
      "But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world.",
      "Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.",
      "All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?",
      "'Nowhere else to turn'",
      "In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.",
      "\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"",
      "The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.",
      "The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.",
      "It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.",
      "Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.",
      "\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"",
      "Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.",
      "A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.",
      "\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"",
      "While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.",
      "\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"",
      "And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.",
      "\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"",
      "A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.",
      "And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.",
      "An election upended",
      "Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.",
      "Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.",
      "\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"",
      "Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"",

Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"",

    "story": [
      "Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says.",
      "It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (\u00a3677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America.",
      "The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.",
      "On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.",
      "Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.",
      "Made in India",
      "He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move.",
      "\"We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,\" Mr Cook said.",
      "Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub \"for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US\".",
      "China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.",
      "However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.",
      "Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: \"There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.",
      "\"Apple have said they want to invest $500bn over the next few years.\"",
      "Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy \"reciprocal tariffs\" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US.",
      "But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted.",
      "Uncertainty reigns",
      "For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed.",
      "The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump tells business chiefs he needs 'little bit of time' as US economy shrinks",
      "Trump calls Bezos as Amazon says no plan to show tariff price rises",
      "Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter.",
      "It forecast similar growth in the months ahead.",
      "\"Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,\" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption \u2013 like the pandemic \u2013 stronger than before.",
      "\"We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic this could happen again.\"",
      "New positioning",
      "The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was \"impressive\" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy.",
      "\"This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,\" Mr Moorhead said.",
      "\"There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,\" he said.",
      "Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs.",
      "The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials.",
      "For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile.",
      "Overall sales jumped 9% to $155.7bn in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits surged more than 60% year-on-year to roughly $17bn."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "summary": "The online marketplace says it will move to a \"local fulfillment model\" in the US, with sales handled by locally based sellers.",
    "story": [
      "Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.",
      "The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.",
      "Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called \"de minimis\" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.",
      "Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.",
      "\"All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.",
      "\"The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,\" it added.",
      "Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (\u00a3600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.",
      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",
      "In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.",
      "Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).",
      "Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.",
      "Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices",
      "And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.",
      "Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.",
      "Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\", adding they would make \"price adjustments\" from 25 April.",
      "Why has Trump closed the loophole?",
      "In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.",
      "The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.",
      "During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.",
      "It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages \"to exploit the de minimis exemption\".",
      "\"These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,\" it added.",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",
      "How Temu is shaking up the world of online shopping",
      "The rise and rise of fashion giant Shein",
      "The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop \"abuse\" of the exemption.",
      "\"The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,\" it said.",
      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",
      "Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.",
      "In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.",
      "In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\".",
      "The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than \u20ac150 (\u00a3127.50; $169.35).",
      "Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.",
      "Will US border checks change?",
      "Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.",
      "Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.",
      "There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.",
      "According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would \"shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.\"",
      "\"CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,\" it added."

      "Deadly clashes between Islamist armed factions, security forces and fighters from the Druze religious minority near Damascus are another sign of the continuing fragility of the security situation in Syria after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Outside players have once again been involved, with Israel saying it carried out air strikes to protect Druze civilians.",
      "It marks another fault-line in Syria, which has been left fractured and divided in the wake of 13 years of devastating civil war and decades of authoritarian rule by the Assad dynasty.",
      "The new Syrian authorities have said they are determined to bring unity and stability, but many inside and outside the country still point to their roots in jihadism and remain suspicious of their agenda.",

      "First Druze crossing in 50 years as Israel courts allies in Syria",
      "Syria's minorities seek security as country charts new future",
      "Before President Assad was toppled, his rule had been re-established in the main cities in Syria and along the highways between them - as well as the coastal heartland of the Alawite sect to which his family belongs.",
      "But there were other regions partially or almost completely out of his control.",
      "They included Idlib in the north, from where Syria's current leader Ahmed al-Sharaa led his Islamist rebel faction Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - a former al-Qaeda affiliate - to victory last December.",
      "In the north-east, Syrian Kurdish forces maintained semi-autonomy throughout the civil war and beyond.",
      "And south of Damascus, the Druze have also had some limited autonomy.",
      "Those divisions remain, although the Alawite areas are now the most serious flashpoints for Syria's new rulers.",
      "In March, days of fighting between security forces and fighters still loyal to Assad left hundreds of people dead, including civilians. Other armed factions loosely affiliated to the new authorities also became involved and carried out revenge killings against local Alawites.",
      "Such violence is the biggest fear both for those who support Sharaa and those who are against him.",
      "The latest clashes to the south of Damascus again involved fighters from several of the armed factions still active in Syria and the Druze. Their religion is an offshoot of Islam, with sizeable communities not only in Syria, but in Lebanon, Jordan and Israel too.",
      "It is the connection with Israel that prompted the country's air force to carry out several strikes during fighting in and around the town of Ashrafiyat Sahnaya on Wednesday.",
      "The Israeli government said the operation was a warning and demanded that the Syrian authorities prevent harm to the Druze.",
      "Syrian authorities said security forces were deployed to Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to restore security and stability, accusing what it called \"outlaw groups\" based there of instigating the clashes.",
      "But the spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence as an \"unjustifiable genocidal campaign\" and said people had been defending their homes from attacks by extremists.",
      "According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 101 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.",
      "The UK-based monitoring group said that included 71 members of the Druze community, including 10 civilians and 35 gunmen who were shot dead in an \"ambush\" while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday, as well as 30 members of the security forces and allied armed groups.",
      "For now at least, the violence has abated, with the government said to have agreed ceasefires with local Druze leaders.",
      "But the suddenness and ferocity with which the clashes erupted - prompted it seems by an audio recording circulating on social media of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad, falsely attributed to a Druze cleric - shows the potential for Syria to slide back into conflict.",
      "There is mutual suspicion between the new Islamist-led authorities and religious minorities like the Alawites and the Druze.",
      "It is a combustible mixture, which is only further inflamed by the role that outside countries like Israel and Turkey continue to play. Both have advanced their interests inside Syria since the fall of Assad.",
      "Israel has seized more land in the south of Syria beyond the area of the Golan Heights that it has long occupied.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the full demilitarisation of Suweida and two other provinces south of Damascus. He says the new Syrian government is extremist and that the presence of its security forces anywhere near the border would represent a threat to Israel.",
      "Israel has played up its connection with the Druze community in the region, presenting itself as their defender, even if many Syrian Druze themselves do not see it that way.",
      "The new authorities in Damascus have rejected Israel's moves as an infringement of Syria's sovereignty, although they have been keen to make clear that they are not seeking conflict with Israel.",
      "Turkey was the key sponsor of the rebel forces that finally ousted Assad and it has established close ties with the country's new leadership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced Israel's latest military intervention in Syria as a \"dangerous and unacceptable provocation\".",
      "Tension between Turkey and Israel over their differing aims in the new Syria add another complication to the host of problems facing Sharaa and his government.",
      "With so many forces both inside and outside Syria still dangerously at odds with one another, the goal of unifying and stabilising the country - despite some successes so far - remains hugely challenging.",
      "Syria will need plenty of breathing space as well as financial and political support from the international community to make real progress towards a better future for its citizens, impoverished and uprooted by years of bitter conflict."

      "It came as US President Donald Trump threatened action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals on Thursday, after Washington introduced fresh sanctions this week on companies it said had links to Tehran.",
      "Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal.",
      "He has previously warned of military action if these new talks, which began in April, do not succeed. Both sides described the first round of talks in Oman's capital Muscat as \"constructive\".",

      "\"Whenever tensions escalate, we are the first ones to bear the brunt of it. But we are still treated as suspects and expected to put our lives on hold,\" another student, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC.",
      "Yet the backlash feels a lot worse this time, says Shafi Subhan, a shawl seller from the region's Kupwara district, who also worked in Mussoorie.",
      "In his 20 years of doing business there, Subhan said he had never faced any public threat - not even after the 2019 terror attack in Pulwama district, which killed 40 paramilitary police troopers.",
      "To him, Mussoorie felt like home, a place where he found peace - despite being hundreds of kilometres away. He said he shared an emotional bond with his customers, who came from all parts of the country",
      "\"People were always kind to us, they wore our garments with so much joy,\" Subhan recalled. \"But on that day when our colleagues were attacked, no one came to help. The public just stood and watched. It hurt them physically - but emotionally, a lot more.\"",
      "Back home in Kashmir, peace has long been fragile. Both India and Pakistan claim the territory in full but administer separate parts, and an armed insurgency has simmered in the Indian-administered region for more than three decades, claiming thousands of lives.",
      "Caught in between, are civilians who say they feel stuck in an endless limbo that feels especially suffocating, whenever ties between India and Pakistan come under strain.",
      "Many allege that in the past, military confrontations between the nations have been followed by waves of harassment and violence against Kashmiris, along with a significant security and communication clampdown in the region.",
      "In recent years, violence has declined, and officials point to improved infrastructure, tourism, and investment as signs of greater stability, particularly since 2019, when the region's special constitutional status was revoked under Article 370.",
      "But arrests and security operations continue, and critics argue that calm has come at the cost of civil liberties and political freedoms.",
      "\"The needle of suspicion is always on locals, even as militancy has declined in the last one-and-a-half decades,\" says Anuradha Bhasin, the managing editor of the Kashmir Times newspapers. \"They always have to prove their innocence.\"",
      "As the news of the killings spread last week, Kashmiris poured onto the streets, holding candlelight vigils and protest marches. A complete shutdown was observed a day after the attack and newspapers printed black front pages. Omar Abdullah publicly apologised, saying he had \"failed his guests\".",
      "Ms Bhasin says Kashmiri backlash against such attacks is not new; there has been similar condemnation in the past as well, although at a smaller scale. \"No one there condones civilian killings - they know the pain of losing loved ones too well.\"",
      "But she adds that it's unfair to place the burden of proving innocence on Kashmiris, when they have themselves become targets of hate and violence. \"This would just instil more fear and further alienate people, many of whom already feel isolated from the rest of the country.\"",
      "Mirza Waheed, a Kashmiri novelist, believes Kashmiris are \"particularly vulnerable as they are seen through a different lens\", being part of India's Muslim population.",
      "\"The saddest part is many of them will suffer the indignity and humiliation, lay low for some time, and wait for this to tide over because they have a life to live.\"",

      "He says his family has no idea where their other 20-year-old son is, whether he joined militancy, or is even dead or alive. His parents say the college student left home last October and never returned. They haven't spoken since.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 00:06:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are locked in a game of chicken - despite wanting the same outcome.",
    "story": [
      "On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.",
      "It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.",
      "\"US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,\" the spokesperson told reporters.",
      "\"China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.\"",
      "The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway \u2013 a suggestion Beijing denied.",
      "\"China has no need to talk to the United States,\" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. \"From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.\"",
      "Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.",
      "The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.",
      "Playing chicken",
      "Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome \u2013 namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.",
      "\"I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,\" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\"[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.\"",
      "Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: \"It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.\"",
      "The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.",
      "\"Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,\" Mr Sung says. \"Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.\"",
      "This peculiar stalemate \u2013 where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it \u2013 has resulted in a tactic of \"constructive ambiguity\": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.",
      "It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.",
      "\"This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,\" he says.",
      "One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a \"much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means\".",
      "That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.",
      "In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.",
      "A win at home",
      "The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing \u2013 but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to \"deliver a win for their domestic audiences\".",
      "\"Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,\" Mr Chong says.",
      "On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.",
      "\"Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,\" Mr Sung says.",
      "\"Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.\"",
      "While China is not unwilling, he adds, \"they are very much stuck on what's the right price point\".",
      "For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a \"two-level game\".",
      "\"The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',\" he says.",
      "\"A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.\"",
      "At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is \"some sort of contact\", according to Mr Chong.",
      "\"The two sides are talking,\" he says. \"And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.\"",
      "But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.",
      "Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the \"posturing\" suggests the two sides have not reached the point \"where they are both trying to seek a way out\".",
      "\"[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.\"",

      "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.",
      "And they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.",
      "Nearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.",
      "Grange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".",
      "\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.",
      "Despite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.",
      "Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.",
      "Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.",
      "And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.",
      "In order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.",
      "A former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.",
      "He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.",
      "Henry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.",
      "\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.",
      "Even non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.",
      "Liberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.",
      "But visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.",
      "The Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.",
      "\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.",
      "Some are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".",
      "\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.",
      "She points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".",
      "\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.",
      "These are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.",
      "In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation.",
      "It is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.",
      "In 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.",

      "Today's dish is koshari - made with lentils, rice and a zesty tomato sauce - in a set of huge cooking pots in one of two community kitchens run by American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), a US-based humanitarian organisation.",
      "\"People rely on our meals; they have no source of income to buy what's left in the local markets and many foods are not available,\" says Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team.",
      "\"In the past we used to cook rice with meat - with protein. Now, because of the closure, there's no type of meat, no fresh vegetables.\"",
      "Two months after Israel cut off all supplies from entering Gaza, Mr Matar is warning that the few dozen remaining food kitchens are set to close in days.",
      "\"The coming days will be critical. We expect we have two weeks' supply, maybe less.\"",
      "On 2 March, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza - preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages it still holds.",
      "Recently, the UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said they had used up all their stocks of food aid.",
      "There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that mass starvation could be imminent and that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime.",
      "\"Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,\" the UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned on Thursday.",
      "\"Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope. It inflicts a cruel collective punishment. Blocking aid kills.\"",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Gazans depend on a few dozen remaining kitchens for sustenance. The one run by Anera in Khan Younis feeds some 6,000 people a day.",
      "But if Israel does not lift its blockade, by far the longest it has ever imposed on Gaza, the kitchens - a last lifeline for so many - will soon have nothing to distribute. Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year, has all but run out.",
      "\"We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week - trucks of food parcels and hygiene kits. Now we don't have anything,\" Mr Matar says as he shows a local BBC journalist around the vast, empty Anera warehouse.",
      "\"We struggle to provide food such as rice, lentils, pasta, cooking oil and salt, for our community kitchens. It's very expensive to buy 1kg of wood and we need over 700kg a day for cooking.\"",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of stealing and storing humanitarian aid to give to its fighters or sell to raise money. The UN and other agencies deny aid has been diverted and say that they have strict monitoring mechanisms.",
      "\"We work hard to avoid any interference from any parties. We have an accurate and strong distribution process,\" says Mr Matar, inspecting lists of aid recipients on his computer.",
      "\"We have a database of hundreds of thousands of people, including their names, ID numbers and addresses - the co-ordinates of the camps. This avoids duplication with the work of other non-governmental organisations and ensures transparency.\"",

      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,400 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 90% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced - with many forced to flee multiple times.",
      "The UN has warned that the current situation \"is likely the worst it has been\" due to the blockade, the renewed offensive and evacuation orders that have displaced some 500,000 people since 18 March.",

    "summary": "What this will and won't change for US assistance to Ukraine, three years into the war.",
    "story": [
      "The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources.",
      "Months in the making, it sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion.",
      "The Ukrainians have now published the deal and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.",
      "No Ukrainian payback to US",
      "Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (\u00a3264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.",
      "But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed \"debt\".",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happensWhat minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Follow reaction to deal as it happens",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back \"much more in theory\" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.",
      "Tougher tone from US towards Putin",
      "The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.",
      "The agreement refers to \"Russia's full-scale invasion\" and the US Treasury Department adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".",
      "This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.",
      "Oil and gas included alongside minerals",
      "Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.",
      "In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.",
      "The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.",
      "Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that \"more value\" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly.",
      "No hindrance to Kyiv's EU ambitions",
      "Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.",
      "There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials.",
      "But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.",
      "It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of \"additional obligations\" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.",
      "Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.",
      "A US military commitment back on table...",
      "The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.",
      "Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "How much has US given to Ukraine?",
      "This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.",
      "One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.",
      "...but US can still walk away any time",
      "It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.",
      "Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.",
      "Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.",
      "That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.",
      "Profits to be reinvested in Ukraine?",
      "One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be \"fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy\", either in new projects or reconstruction.",
      "This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.",
      "However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional \"technical\" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that \"these terms will be subject to further discussion\".",
      "After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that \"we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people\".",
      "Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as \"repayment\" to the US for the  \"hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war\"."

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 05:07:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Thousands of reservists have joined calls to end the Gaza war and bring the remaining hostages back.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's war in Gaza grinds on, but opposition is growing.",
      "In recent weeks, thousands of Israeli reservists \u2013 from all branches of the military \u2013 have signed letters demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate instead on reaching a deal to bring back the remaining 59 hostages being held by Hamas.",
      "Eighteen months ago, few Israelis doubted the war's logic: to defeat Hamas and return the hostages.",
      "For many, the January ceasefire and subsequent return of more than 30 hostages raised hopes that the war might soon end.",
      "But after Israel broke the ceasefire and returned to war in mid-March, those hopes were dashed.",
      "\"We came to the conclusion that Israel is going to a very bad place,\" Danny Yatom, a former head of the spy agency Mossad told me.",
      "\"We understand that what mainly bothers Netanyahu is his own interests. And in the list of priorities, his interests and the interests of having the government stable are the first ones, and not the hostages.\"",
      "Many of those signing recent letters are, like Yatom, long time critics of the prime minister. Some were involved in the anti-government protests that preceded the outbreak of war on 7 October 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel.",
      "But Yatom says that's not why he decided to speak out.",
      "\"I signed my name and I am participating in the demonstrations not because of any political reason, but because of a national reason,\" he said.",
      "\"I am highly concerned that my country is going to lose its way.\"",
      "The first open letter to be published, in early April, was signed by 1,000 air force reservists and retirees.",
      "\"The continuation of the war does not contribute to any of its declared goals,\" they wrote, \"and will lead to the death of the hostages\".",
      "The signatories urged Israelis to follow their lead before time ran out on the estimated 24 hostages still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "\"Every day that passes is further risking their lives. Every moment of hesitation is a crying shame.\"",
      "In the weeks since, similar letters have appeared from almost every branch of the military, including elite fighting and intelligence units, along with a number of decorated commanders.",
      "More than 12,000 signatures all.",
      "After 7 October, hundreds of thousands of Israeli reservists answered the call, eager to serve.",
      "But now, more and more are refusing, with reports suggesting that reserve attendance has dropped to as little as 50-60%.",
      "Anti-Hamas protests on rise in Gaza as group's iron grip slips",
      "As an Israeli hostage turns 48, his wife waits for blue ticks on her messages",
      "'Part of us is still in Gaza': Freed Israeli hostages fight for a new ceasefire",
      "For a military that depends heavily on reservists to fight its wars, it's a looming crisis on a scale not seen since Israel's first Lebanon war in 1982.",
      "In a leafy Jerusalem park, I met \"Yoav\" (not his real name), an infantry reservist who asked not to be identified.",
      "Yoav served in Gaza last summer but said he wouldn't do it again.",
      "\"I had the feeling that I needed to go to help my brothers and sisters,\" he told me.",
      "\"I believed I was doing something good. Complicated but good. But now, I don't see it in the same way anymore.\"",
      "The government's determination to keep fighting Hamas, while hostages risk death in the tunnels of Gaza, Yoav said, was misplaced.",
      "\"We are very strong and we can beat Hamas, but it's not about beating Hamas,\" he said. \"It's about losing our country.\"",
      "During his time in Gaza, Yoav told me, he tried to be \"the best moral soldier that a man can be\".",
      "But the longer the war goes on, critics say, the harder it is for Israel to claim, as government officials often do, that its military is the most moral army in the world.",
      "In a recent column in the left of centre newspaper Haaretz, the retired general Amiram Levin said it was time for soldiers \u2013 starting with senior commanders - to think about disobeying orders.",
      "\"The risk of being dragged into war crimes and suffering a fatal blow to the Israel Defense Forces and our social ethos,\" he wrote, \"make it impossible to stand idly by\".",
      "Some of Israel's critics, including those who have brought cases before the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice, argue that such lines have already been crossed.",
      "Netanyahu has lashed out at the protesters, dismissing their concerns as \"propaganda lies\", spread by \"a small handful of fringe elements \u2013 loud, anarchist and disconnected pensioners, most of whom haven't served in years\".",
      "But polls suggest the protest letters reflect a growing public conviction: that the release of the remaining hostages should come before everything.",
      "In Tel Aviv, where noisy anti-war demonstrations have been held for well over a year, images of the hostages are held aloft, while other protestors sit on the road, cradling pictures of Palestinian children killed during the war.",
      "Amid the row generated by the letters, such emotive displays appear to have rattled the authorities.",
      "On 20 April, the police briefly told protesters that \"pictures of children or babies from Gaza\" would not be permitted, along with posters displaying the words \"genocide\" or \"ethnic cleansing\".",
      "Following expressions of outrage from the organisers, the police quickly backed down.",
      "Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to speak of his determination to defeat Hamas.",
      "Military pressure, Netanyahu continues to insist, is the only way to bring the hostages home."

    "story": [
      "The TikTok video begins with Singapore's health minister Ong Ye Kung smiling at the camera while sitting on a park bench.",
      "\"So no-one told you life was gonna be this way,\" the instantly recognisable theme song to the sitcom Friends plays, as he's suddenly joined by the other four members of his team running in the upcoming general election.",
      "Cut to a snappy montage of them fist-bumping each other and mingling with residents at community events, as the song's chorus delivers their political message: \"I'll be there for you\".",
      "It's one of the many social media videos posted by Singapore's long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) as the country gears up for the general election on Saturday.",
      "One of the longest-serving political parties in the world, the PAP has governed Singapore since 1959 and is widely associated with stability.",
      "But even as it continues to win elections with comfortable majorities, the PAP has also faced declining popularity over the last two decades.",
      "In recent years the party has embarked on a mission to revamp its straitlaced, no-nonsense image, particularly to attract younger voters who have typically been more sympathetic to the opposition.",
      "This campaign season, PAP ministers better known for stilted pre-written speeches have also been filming skits with social media influencers and sitting down for long conversations on podcasts. The party has even launched a special edition of the viral Labubu doll dressed in their white uniform.",
      "Leading the PAP in his first election since he took office as prime minister, Lawrence Wong boasts a significant online portfolio.",
      "On his social media accounts he has been showing off his guitar skills and discussing the national budget at a cat cafe. His recent visit to Vietnam was recapped on TikTok over a techno rave soundtrack.",
      "Other ministers in his cabinet have also ramped up their efforts: in an online video series with a local actor, culture minister Edwin Tong played barista and served  coffees; meanwhile health minister Ong spent a day as an trainee at a local radio station.",
      "Numerous Singaporean influencers have put out content featuring PAP faces, in what appears to be a concerted party effort to connect with a younger audience. Last June, local influencers and celebrities attended a PAP event that publicised their alignment with the party.",
      "Valerie Tan Su Min, a content creator who makes satirical videos about politics but does not work with political parties, told the BBC that efforts such as collaborations with influencers could seal the deal for some young voters.",
      "\"If they had not done their own research or realised the gravity of their vote, it's very possible that they might see one or two videos and be like, 'OK that's who I vote for,'\" she said.",
      "There's little doubt that the PAP, which has long held an overwhelming parliamentary majority, will continue to govern after this election.",
      "It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have personally seen the country flourish under PAP rule.",
      "But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.",
      "Still, in the last three elections, the party has experienced two of its worst-ever showings at the polls - a little over 60% of the popular vote.",
      "With an ageing support base, the key to the PAP's future victories is young people.",
      "\"Candidates from different political parties have taken to social media like never before,\" says Carol Soon, associate professor in communications and new media at the National University of Singapore, adding that the medium is \"increasingly assuming a 'broadcasting' nature\".",
      "Opposition parties have also jumped on the bandwagon, taking part in TikTok video trends and launching online talkshows.",
      "Some have turned awkward moments of their campaigns into social media gold. One of the most popular memes this election, \"look left look right\", stems from a song by an opposition candidate lamenting his dismal job prospects. After it went viral, he released a follow-up song about the lack of affordable housing.",
      "Social media has always been particularly important to opposition parties in Singapore, where the PAP government exerts significant control over mainstream media. It's also a medium that has become especially popular after a quarantine election in 2020 limited in-person campaigning.",
      "But the opposition's efforts have been dwarfed by the PAP's, thanks to its deep pockets.",
      "\"Resources still matter when it comes to digital campaigning,\" says Netina Tan, associate professor of political science at McMaster University, who noted that the \"resource-rich\" PAP can afford to \"amp up their digital campaign...and put out fancy Insta videos\".",
      "Rae Fung, a 28-year-old speaking coach, said she was paying extra attention to local podcasts featuring politicians as guests.",
      "\"It's very hard to lie about your expertise on a podcast. Because it goes really deep and usually it's not too edited,\" she said. \"It helps me understand their thought process and who they are as a person.\"",
      "\"Most of the candidates I've seen, they're doing enough on social media to reach us,\"  she said. But \"how they show up and who they are as a person is a lot more important than their social media game.\"",
      "For young Singaporeans like Ms Fung, their votes will ultimately go to the party that makes the most convincing pitch to solve their problems.",
      "The rising cost of living in Singapore - which consistently ranks as one of the most expensive places in the world to live in - has been one of the biggest concerns for young people. Many still worry that owning a home will becoming increasingly unaffordable in the future.",
      "There has also been growing uncertainty about job prospects and the economy. Singapore's authorities and economists have warned of the fallout and a possible technical recession from the US-China trade war and US President Donald Trump's global tariffs.",
      "The PAP government has tried to address these worries. Besides providing subsidised housing for first-time buyers, it has increased the supply of public flats and issued subsidies and cash vouchers to help with childcare and daily expenses. Opposition parties argue they can do more.",
      "At a recent PAP election rally, one 37-year-old attendee who declined to be named said that while he was \"not very confident\" that the PAP would be able to lead the country out of the global economic uncertainty, his \"confidence level is even lower\" for the opposition.",
      "Meanwhile at an opposition rally, 28-year-old Ariel, who only gave her first name, told the BBC that many of her peers have not been able to get jobs after graduation. She did not think the government had addressed their worries.",
      "Voting in more of opposition candidates would be the way \"for Singaporeans to voice out our pain and concerns\", she insisted.",
      "In Singapore media campaigns may be important for drumming up political participation during elections, said Dr Soon, but social media engagement does not translate directly into support at the ballot box.",
      "\"At the end of the day,\" she said, it's about \"whom people think would deliver\" - be it providing more jobs, lowering costs of living, or being alternative voices in parliament."

    "story": [
      "A former biology teacher-turned-environmentalist is on a crusade in Uganda to save the once-flourishing trees from which shea butter is made - the cosmetic known as \"women's gold\".",
      "Mustafa Gerima wants local communities to stop chopping down the trees to make charcoal - which they say is more profitable than the oil, also used in cooking, that is extracted from its fruit.",
      "He gave up teaching to dedicate himself to the trees when he returned home six years ago and was shocked to find the Mount Kei Central Forest Reserve, once lush with wild shea trees, had been turned into a near-barren expanse dotted with stumps.",
      "Now nicknamed \"Bwana Shea\" or Mr Shea, he walks from village to village in the north-west of the country rallying people to protect what he sees as a vanishing treasure.",
      "Local people, he said, had lost interest in the trees and began chopping them down as farmers were experiencing failed harvests.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, the shea nut tree had a pattern of its production. It flowered in December then by the time it reached April, it would be ready,\" Mr Gerima told the BBC.",
      "\"But now because of climate change there is this prolonged drought. Hence it affects the production of shea nuts.\"",
      "The growing popularity of charcoal from the shea nut tree has made the situation worse. It is said to burn for longer than other charcoal.",
      "\"Our community is affected by poverty. So they look at the tree as a cheap alternative source of income,\" Mr Gerima said.",
      "Uganda is losing an estimated 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of forest cover each year, and a significant portion of that includes shea nut trees, according to the country's environment ministry.",
      "Shea trees grow in the wild from West to East Africa - a vast strip known as the \"shea belt\". But the shea tree population has dramatically  plummeted in recent year, it says.",
      "This loss, combined with the poor harvests, has had a direct impact on people like Mariam Chandiru, a local shea butter producer for many years in the northern town of Koboko.",
      "\"We would get good money to take our children to school and take care of our families. But now my business is collapsing, it is a huge setback,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I used to sell up to five jerry cans of shea oil a week, right now I can only fill two jerry cans at most.\"",
      "It has traditionally been women who have gathered the nuts of the shea tree to produce Nilotica shea butter, prized globally for its cosmetic and culinary uses.",
      "Professor John Bosco Okullo, a leading agroforestry expert from Uganda's Makerere University who has been studying shea nut trees for more than two decades, also blames years of widespread insecurity for the problems.",
      "\"In the 1990s, communities used to own and protect the shea trees,\" the academic, who is part of a European Union project aiming to conserve and utilise the tree, told the BBC.",
      "This was before much of the north of the country was ravaged by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, whose fighters were notorious for abducting children - forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves.",
      "The rebels have largely been wiped out, but nearly 20 years of conflict drove people to leave their villages and find safety in camps.",
      "Other communities were affected by dangerous cattle raids - also leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the early 2000s.",
      "\"After cattle raiding and civil unrest by the Lord's Resistance Army displaced people, the sense of ownership was lost,\" said Prof Okullo",
      "\"When people returned, they adapted to short-term gains like charcoal burning.\"",
      "Prof Okullo agrees with Mr Gerima that climate change has further exacerbated the situation.",
      "\"The productivity has gone down. The trees are not flowering and fruiting the way they used to. Rain fluctuation has disrupted the shea tree's natural cycles,\" he said.",
      "Rapid urban expansion is another threat.",
      "\"Most of these places which used to have shea trees now have new districts, new hospitals, schools,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"You find the shea trees are being cut for development. We need affirmative planting. Otherwise, if we are waiting for natural regeneration, it is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Despite what seems like a gloomy outlook, Prof Okullo takes heart from campaigners such as Mr Gerima.",
      "The former teacher's most widely known initiative involved a 19-day, 644km (400-mile) walk in 2020.",
      "He trekked from Uganda's capital, Kampala, to the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) headquarters in Nairobi, capital of neighbouring Kenya.",
      "\"Right now, there are a lot of NGOs mobilising communities,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"People are planting new trees and protecting those regenerating from stumps.",
      "\"Some are even using grafting techniques to shorten the juvenile phase - it used to take 15 to 20 years before fruiting, now some trees are fruiting much earlier.\"",
      "To meet rising demand and support sustainable supply chains, the professor and his colleagues are embracing technology.",
      "\"We are teaming up with our colleagues in computer science and physics to use Artificial Intelligence so that we can map the mature shea trees and try to project the yield,\" he said.",
      "The Ugandan government has also recognised the vulnerability of the shea nut tree. In 2023, it made the cutting down of trees for charcoal illegal.",
      "But enforcement has been patchy.",
      "\"There was a presidential order to stop cutting shea trees, but it's been difficult to implement,\" Prof Okullo said.",
      "\"The demand for charcoal is highest in urban areas. Those who cut the trees aren't the ones using the charcoal. We need to provide alternative energy sources for cities to reduce the demand.\"",
      "For Mr Gerima, it remains a personal issue.",
      "\"Seeing people cut the tree has always caused me a lot of pain in my heart,\" he said.",
      "He continues his long walks to raise awareness, speaking to local councils, organising planting drives.",
      "\"This must not be one man's issue - it must bring in a concerted effort, a collective responsibility.\"",
      "His next steps include launching a grassroots tree-monitoring initiative and partnering with schools to integrate conservation into the local curriculum.",
      "He says his mission is not just to save a tree but to preserve a way of life.",

It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.",

    "summary": "The real battleground of the current trade war might be China's domestic economy",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Laura read this article",
      "If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.",
      "The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.",
      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",
      "And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.",
      "\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.",
      "Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.",
      "The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.",
      "This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.",
      "Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",

      "Published30 April 2025",
      "Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.",
      "Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.",
      "Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".",
      "The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.",
      "He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.",
      "At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.",
      "Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections.",
      "What happened on TikTok?",
      "Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.",
      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",
      "The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".",
      "Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.",
      "But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians.",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.",
      "Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election",
      "Influencer campaign",
      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

      "For generations villagers have made a living growing pomegranates, almonds and peaches and foraging in the surrounding forests for wild fruits and spices.",
      "But Sergele, located 16km (10 miles) from the border with Turkey, has become increasingly surrounded by Turkish military bases, which are dotted across the slopes.",
      "One, perched halfway up the western ridge, looms over the village, while another in the east is under construction.",
      "At least seven have been built here over the past two years, including one by a small dam that regulates Sergele's water supply, rendering it off limits to villagers.",
      "\"This is 100% a form of occupation of Kurdish [Iraqi Kurdistan] lands,\" says farmer Sherwan Sherwan Sergeli, 50, who has lost access to some of his land.",
      "\"The Turks ruined it.\"",
      "Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984.",
      "The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places.",
      "Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict.",
      "Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK.",
      "When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq.",
      "Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling.",
      "\"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan.",
      "Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known.",
      "Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq.",
      "Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found.",
      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",
      "While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
      "The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK.",
      "The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future.",
      "Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now.",
      "Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years.",
      "\"The moment you get here, you will have a drone hover over you,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"They will shoot you if you stay.\"",
      "The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since.",
      "Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele.",
      "Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own.",
      "\"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds.",
      "Little leverage",
      "Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries.",
      "At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash.",
      "\"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory.",
      "But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds.",
      "Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region.",
      "Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK.",
      "In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands.",
      "In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK.",
      "But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq.",
      "Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance.",
      "Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment.",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",

      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",

      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",

      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",
      "\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"",
      "But he says he bears no anger anymore.",
      "\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

    "story": [
      "On the journey into Yarrabah, there is nothing to suggest a national election is just days away.",
      "Posters for candidates, inescapable in other parts of Australia, are conspicuously absent as you drive past fields of sugar cane and down a gently winding coastal road.",
      "After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream \u2013 urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.",
      "\"It's weird,\" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. \"We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.\"",
      "Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that \"they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns\".",
      "\"So,\" she asks \"what the hell's going on?\"",
      "Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a \"national shame\".",
      "Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.",
      "One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous \"welcome to country\" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were \"overdone\" and should not take place so frequently.",
      "The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people \u2013 and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.",
      "Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky \u2013 especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",
      "That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.",
      "Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special \"classes\" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.",
      "Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to \"play it safe\" and avoid \"the hot Aboriginal issues\".",
      "Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.",
      "On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC \"now the hard work starts\".",
      "Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.",
      "\"This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,\" he said.",
      "\"What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.\"",
      "Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that \"Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place\".",
      "Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.",
      "\"In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,\" she said.",
      "\"This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.\"",
      "Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.",
      "The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening \u2013 including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.",
      "Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it \"electorally foolish\" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.",
      "He points to Coalition adverts that tie money \"wasted\" on the referendum \u2013 which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m \u2013 into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.",
      "Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.",
      "\"I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,\" he says. \"I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.\"",
      "Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.",
      "\"This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population\" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.",
      "Independent MP Bob Katter puts it more bluntly.",
      "A former minister of Aboriginal Affairs when a Queensland state MP in the 1980s, Mr Katter says he thinks about the struggles of many Indigenous Australians \"every night before I go to bed\".",
      "He told the BBC he believes in more self-governance and has campaigned to give greater access to farmable land and fishing rights.",
      "He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.",
      "\"As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That's hard for many Indigenous people to swallow given the toll the referendum took - on those on both sides of the debate.",
      "A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 \"validated\" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.",
      "About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.",
      "\"While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,\" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.",
      "\"This is its insidiousness.\"",
      "In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got \"so many racist remarks\" after the vote.",
      "\"To do this to young people, who have left community to better their life and to be something, is so wrong,\" she said.",
      "'My ancestors were invisible. I want to be visible'",
      "Hurt ripples in wake of Indigenous Voice vote",
      "It was not just increased racism that caused harm, but the tone and intensity of the debate leading up to the vote, many say.",
      "Mr Mundine says his participation in the toxic and polarised national discussion meant he felt alienated from many in his community.",
      "\"I got kicked off boards. I lost jobs\u2026 [I] was ostracised.\"",
      "\"Being the topic of every discussion for such a long period of time was overwhelming and extremely damaging to people's social and emotional well-being,\"  says Clinton Schultz, a Gamilaroi/Gomeroi man, psychologist and Director of First Nations Strategy at the Black Dog Institute.",
      "\"The aftermath of that has left a lot of people not willing to engage in in the debates moving forward.\"",
      "Millima May, a Kulumbirigin Danggalaba Tiwi woman from the Northern Territory, in 2023 told the BBC all First Nations people wanted was \"a seat at the table\" where decisions about their lives were made. But now there's been a \"tactical\" decision by some in the community to \"lie low\".",
      "\"I think a lot of Aboriginal people have really chosen to opt out of the political space and of so -called democracy in Australia,\" she says.",

      "The US president also spoke about the cost of eggs - a concern for many US consumers due to an ongoing bird flu outbreak - and said: \"Since I took office, the cost of eggs is down 87%.\"",
      "This claim is false.",
      "The average national price for consumers of a dozen large Grade A eggs when Trump entered office in January was about $4.95 (\u00a33.70).",

      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

    "summary": "Mark Carney's party pull off an election win that once looked near-impossible, until the US president targeted Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",

      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \"Laugh-In\" when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\"I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\" he wrote in his 2023 memoir \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\" \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \"Laugh-In,\" her most frequent target was Arte Johnson's dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",

      "Miles off the coast of Oahu's North Shore, the choppy crystal-blue Pacific waters are home to one of nature's most misunderstood predators \u2014 the Galapagos shark.",
      "\"CBS Mornings\" co-host Nate Burleson recently joined the watermen of Island View Hawaii to confront his lifelong fear of sharks, swimming cage-free among these majestic creatures as part of \"CBS Mornings\" \"Never Too Late\" series showcasing new experiences.",
      "\"They are so majestic, powerful. Unbelievable man. I can't believe I did that,\" Burleson said moments after emerging from the water. \"I don't even know what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting that.\"",
      "The expedition, which followed Burleson's previous fear-conquering skydive with the U.S. Army, brought him face-to-face with nine Galapagos sharks \u2014 creatures that can grow to more than 10 feet long with 14 rows of serrated teeth.",
      "Dr. Andrew Rossiter, director of the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu, said that while sharks are indeed predators, humans are not their natural prey.",
      "\"I've literally seen hundreds and hundreds of sharks while I've been diving,\" Rossiter said. \"Not so much scared, but I've always been in awe of them, because I know what they could do, potentially.\"",
      "Burleson's mother was less enthusiastic about her son's adventure when he called to inform her.",
      "\"Oh I don't feel good about that at all,\" she told him. \"You're serious, Nathaniel? I don't trust you. I don't trust the sharks and I don't trust the water! Period!\"",
      "Despite his mother's concerns, Burleson found unexpected peace once in the water.",
      "\"I felt comfortable around them,\" he reflected. \"The way they circle around, and like peep you out... and if you look at them and you're like 'what's up fam?' They will just cruise on by. It's amazing.\"",
      "The experience changed his perspective, fostered in part by 1975's blockbuster \"Jaws,\" which altered how generations view ocean predators.",
      "\"There was a mutual respect,\" Burleson said.",

    "summary": "Belichick's statement comes after segments of the interview posted to social media focused attention on the 73-year-old's relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
    "story": [
      "Former Patriots coach Bill Belichick says his recent\u00a0interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0created \"a false narrative\" about his relationship with his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson.",
      "Belichick, 73, who is now head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil ahead of the release of his new book, \"The Art of Winning,\" but many commenters online focused on the glimpses of his relationship with Hudson.",
      "In a statement released Wednesday, Belichick said, \"Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" the statement continued. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help refocus the discussion.\"",
      "A CBS News spokesperson\u00a0responded: \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview. There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\"",
      "Belichick's statement comes after portions of the interview posted to social media\u00a0generated scrutiny\u00a0of his relationship.",
      "Out of the eight-minute segment that aired on \"Sunday Morning,\" Belichick and Dokoupil discussed Hudson, whom the football legend described in his upcoming book as his \"creative muse,\" for about one minute and 30 seconds.",
      "Dokoupil said in the recorded voiceover that Hudson was a \"constant presence\" during the interview. He asked Belichick, \"You have Jordon right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "\"I've never been too worried about what everybody else thinks,\" Belichick replied. \"Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right.\"",
      "When Belichick was asked how the two of them met, Hudson spoke up: \"Not talking about this.\"",
      "In his statement Wednesday, Belichick defended Hudson.",
      "\"She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021,\" he said.",
      "\"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative \u2014 that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation \u2014 which is simply not true.\"",
      "In a separate statement released Tuesday, Belichick's literary agent, InkWell Management, said the segments resulted in \"a raft of hostile social media posts about his personal life.\"",
      "\"Bill has written an authoritative and entertaining book about success that should be judged by its contents, not by the clicks generated by the segment,\" InkWell Management said.",

      "At the golden age of 100, Marshall Allen is still on tour. He's promoting New Dawn, his first solo album with his name and was honored Saturday with the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship.",
      "Allen grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, listening to the sounds of Duke Ellington's jazz orchestra. The clarinet was the first instrument Allen learned to play. He then learned the saxophone, while serving in the Army band during World War II.",
      "\"I'm going in like I'm going to be a hero. I'm going to do this and that, but when I got that reality of Army life, it was \u2026 it was different,\" he said.",
      "His sound is unique because he doesn't just play the written melody, he adds random notes at random times to reflect how the songs make him feel.",
      "\"You just have to depend on the spirit of the song,\" Allen said.",
      "How Allen played and his reasons why changed in the late 1950s when he met Herman Poole Blount, known as Sun Ra. The composer and leader of \"Sun Ra Arkestra\" later welcomed Allen into his group, but not without criticism.",
      "\"He said 'You sound good, had a tone and your disk and it sound good, but it's not what I want.' I said, 'Now what is it that you want?' He is saying \u2026 'I want to hear what you don't know.'\"",
      "Sun Ra's fascination with outer space and the true freedom it could offer inspired his cosmic blend of jazz, Afrofuturism and spiritual expression. He encouraged his artists to play from the heart and improvise when they \"felt the spirit.\"",
      "For years, the group lived together in Philadelphia and practiced relentlessly.",
      "\"Rehearsed day and night,\" Allen said. \"I had to get my discipline together.\"",
      "When Sun Ra died in the early 1990s, Allen became the new leader. For the last 30 years he has been teaching musicians the art of playing what they don't know.",
      "Jazz music journey",
      "Allen said jazz music is just as important today as it was when he was starting out.",
      "The routine of preparing for a show and testing his instruments never seems to get old for Allen, who turns 101 next month, and recently performed in Brooklyn, New York.",
      "\"I've been doing this so long,\" he said. \"70, 80, 90 years.\"",
      "It's been time well spent doing what he loves, which is making people feel something. He said what keeps him going with jazz is, \"the spirit of things and not knowing everything.\"",
      "As for the next generation of musicians, Allen said they \"have to earn it.\"",
      "\"If you want to play music, you have to get it,\" he said. \"You have to be in a spirit. You have to play what you don't know.\"",

      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",

      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",

      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",

      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",

    "summary": "Some FDA scientists and inspections staff were told that their layoffs may be rescinded.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",
      "The FDA's labs had already been struggling with new hurdles to purchasing that had slowed their work, as staff waited for weeks in some cases for supply orders, officials said.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 11:44:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on a tax loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",
      "The consumer won't emerge unscathed.",
      "\"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, new federal data shows, a sign the labor market is still humming despite ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger than expected in April, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Payroll gains exceeded economist forecasts of 135,000 last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, matching forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The data suggests the labor market remains healthy despite rising concerns about how the Trump administration's tariff policies will impact economic activity.",
      "Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a research note that the stronger-than-expected pace of job-creation last month shows the risks of a recession are low, at least for now.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here. You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports.

      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-minerals-deal-trump-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

      "In a letter\u00a0sent to the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, asks for an \"automatic exclusion\" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs. One business owner who recently spoke to\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch\u00a0said she fears her company may have to close up shop for good.",
      "Less room to maneuver",
      "If tariffs persist, small business owners could end up passing on the cost to customers in the form of higher prices, as large corporations such as Amazon, Temu and Shein have done in recent weeks.",
      "However, unlike huge corporations, any declines in consumer spending as a result of higher prices could spell financial disaster for many small businesses, which typically operate with tight margins. Roughly 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four months, according to a recent TD Bank survey.",

      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

      "Specifically, regulators alleged in a 2023\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0that PCH used \"dark patterns\" to trick customers into thinking they had to make a purchase to enter the sweepstakes, or increase their odds of winning. The FTC also said PCH sent emails to people with deceptive subject lines suggesting they were related to official government documents, like tax forms.",
      "Christopher Irving, vice president of consumer and legal affairs at PCH, noted in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that, while refund checks are going out now, the FTC's complaint and settlement are from two years ago.",

      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Led by Musk, the cost-cutting task force has overseen the mass firings of federal workers, including more than 216,000 government employees terminated from their jobs in March.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes\u00a0paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, while wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket,'\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and-forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

      "\"You got a lot of sales in March that were basically people buying ahead of the tariffs,\" economist Patrick Anderson told CBS News. \"And that means, unfortunately, we're gonna have lower sales later on when those people aren't buying cars that they originally intended to buy.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. took effect on April 3. President Trump announced on Tuesday that he would provide some relief to U.S. automakers by ensuring they are not also levied with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Approximately 90% of the parts in a Hyundai Ioniq 6 sedan with a sticker price of nearly $51,000 on George Glassman's dealership are manufactured in South Korea. Glassman said this is the kind of vehicle that would see its price rise if the tariffs remain in place.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies.",
      "The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of products and services \u2014 shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic.",
      "The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet.",
      "The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.\u00a0slipping into a recession in 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs were announced on April 2 \u2014 after the end of the quarter \u2014 businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year.",
      "The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note.",
      "Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said.",
      "\"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 \u2014 a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "Yet GDP could get a second-quarter boost as companies import fewer goods in the current quarter due to the rollout of the tariffs and the front-loading at the start of the year, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Another key measure of the economy's health \u2014 known as final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months. That suggests demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient despite mounting concerns about the economy.",
      "\"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\"",
      "Impact of DOGE cuts",
      "Growth in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in imports, as well as a 5.1% decline in government spending, the Commerce Department said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, has effectively shuttered major agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and canceled funding for health and science research.",
      "Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending.",
      "GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.9% in 2025, according to FactSet. That's down from 2.8% in 2024.",
      "\"[T]he inflation data will show when the price increases of tariffs hit consumers, which will deliver a real income shock that we expect to weigh heavily on spending growth,\" Pearce said.",
      "A miss on ADP employment numbers",
      "Another red flag for the U.S. economy came on Wednesday with the release of ADP's employment numbers for April, which showed private employers added 62,000 jobs this month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet.",
      "The monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers created 135,000 new jobs, a slowdown from 228,000 in March, FactSet data shows.",
      "The combination of weak ADP data, the GDP report and other economic data \"increasingly suggest a recession may have begun,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at trading company TradeStation, in an email.",
      "The shaky economic data could persuade the Federal Reserve to hold off on making more rate cuts, experts said. The central bank will make its next rate decision at its May 7 meeting, with most economists forecasting that the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"The data clearly buys the Fed some time to delay cuts; they will likely continue their wait-and-see approach to assess the inflation shocks stemming from the tariffs announced in April,\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",

      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent more than $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found for spending through April 29. We will be tracking and updating the spending throughout the year.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "\"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work.",
      "\"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories.",
      "Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "\"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "In his work at the American Enterprise Institute, Malkus said his review indicates the savings is more likely to be around $80 billion.",
      "Even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far by DOGE would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",

      "U.S. imports of goods made in China expand far beyond toys to include electronics, clothes, household goods, appliances, construction materials and more. The president has said he believes tariffs on Chinese goods will ultimately be substantially lower than 145%.",

      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",

      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",

      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",

    "title": "When is going to college not worth the money?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-college-worth-the-money-heres-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had an annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014 a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2014 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2014 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages of their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

      "The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted.",
      "The Army anniversary coincides with Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14.",
      "A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",

      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 10:00:08 -0400",
    "summary": "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!\" the president said in a post\u200b to Truth Social.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday his administration will be rescinding Harvard University's tax-exempt status, further escalating the ongoing feud with the Ivy League school.",
      "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!\" the president said in a post to Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details about the effort to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization, but he has floated taking such a step as recently as last month.",
      "Roughly 2 million organizations have received tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, including charities like churches, environmental groups and universities. The designation means the groups are exempt from paying federal income taxes and the IRS considers donations to 501(c)(3) organizations to be tax-deductible.",
      "The tax code prohibits executive branch officials from asking an IRS employee to conduct or terminate an audit or investigation into a specific taxpayer.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission. The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth. There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,\" a Harvard spokesperson said in response to Mr. Trump.",
      "The spokesperson continued: \"Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision is the latest in a series of moves targeting the university. His administration announced last month that it would be freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after the university rejected a series of demands made by the administration. Among the conditions were for Harvard to discontinue its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, positions and initiatives, change its hiring practices and change its leadership.",
      "After the Trump administration announced it would be freezing the funding to Harvard, the university sued and alleged the move was unlawful. It's likely a withdrawal of Harvard's tax-exempt status will prompt further legal action.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security also demanded Harvard turn over information on certain foreign student visa holders or risk losing its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. There were more than 6,700 international students enrolled at the school as of October, according to data from the university.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard in a letter to the school of creating a \"hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard's failure to condemn antisemitism.\"",
      "CBS News reported last month that the IRS was considering stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and Mr. Trump told reporters that he believed the school was abusing the designation.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said last month that any \"forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the president\" and said \"investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior to the president's TRUTH,\" a reference to an earlier suggestion by Mr. Trump that Harvard lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard has an endowment of $52.3 billion, the largest of all U.S. universities. The school provided more than $749 million in financial aid and scholarships in fiscal year 2024, and nearly one-third of funding that backs research at Harvard comes from the school.",

    "summary": "A Chinese exporter says Trump's tariffs simply aren't fair, while a U.S. buyer hopes for a trade war truce, because \"China produces what you want.\"",
    "story": [
      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

      "The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law.",

      "The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass.",
      "The rule\u00a0tied to the Clean Air Act\u00a0was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\"",
      "The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule.",

      "National security adviser Mike Waltz is leaving his White House post, although soon after reports about his departure were published, President Trump announced he plans to nominate him to be ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "It was not clear whether Alex Wong, Waltz's deputy, would remain at the National Security Council, as of Thursday afternoon, sources said.",
      "The president also said in a social media post that in the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as national security adviser. Waltz will need to be confirmed by the Senate for the ambassador role.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first. I know he will do the same in his new role. In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department.\"",
      "Waltz said on X, \"I'm deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation.\"",
      "It was a last-minute decision to nominate Waltz to be U.N. ambassador, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump decided Thursday morning, the sources said, but there had been previous discussions about moving Waltz out of the NSC.",
      "Rubio and Waltz had a meeting Thursday to discuss the transition in roles, multiple sources told CBS News. It was unclear, even to some senior advisers at State Department and the White House, when exactly Rubio would take over as interim national security adviser.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau was not informed before the news broke that Waltz would be leaving the NSC, sources said, and the circle of people who knew Waltz would be departing was very small.",
      "A number of factors led to the change. It was perceived at the White House that Waltz didn't adequately vet NSC staff, sources said, in addition to the Signal saga and a lack of a good fit between Waltz and the senior team.",
      "But Mr. Trump respects Waltz, sources said, and, unlike some figures in Mr. Trump's first term, Waltz wasn't ousted unceremoniously. He was instead given a high-profile new post. Journalist Mark Halperin first reported the departures.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce learned of the president's decision to appoint Rubio interim national security adviser during a briefing she was giving Thursday. Asked by a reporter about how long he might serve in the position, Bruce responded, \"It is clear that I just heard this from you.\"",
      "The president's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, had multiple conversations on the Waltz matter on Thursday, sources said.",
      "In March, Waltz came under scrutiny after he put together a Signal chat and mistakenly included The Atlantic's\u00a0Jeffrey Goldberg, disclosing\u00a0discussions with top national security officials about plans\u00a0for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. Goldberg\u00a0published\u00a0his account, and he initially omitted operational details, but after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied any classified information had been shared on the chat, Goldberg published that information, too, which included the timing of the strikes and the weapons packages used.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, but Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump did not ask him to step down at the time. Publicly, President Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "One source familiar with the situation at the National Security Council said the president thinks sufficient time has passed since the Signal incident that Waltz and Wong's departures could be framed as part of a reorganization. The president had been hesitant to oust Waltz over the perception that doing so could be seen as bending to outside pressure.",
      "Wong, reached by phone, declined to comment.",
      "As Mr. Trump's pick to be ambassador to the U.N., Waltz will face Senate confirmation. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said of Waltz and the Signal incident that he gave him credit \"for acknowledging the huge mistake made with that very sensitive information that if it gotten out, we could have lost pilots.\" Nonetheless, when asked by a reporter about the Senate confirmation hearing Waltz would face as a nominee, Warner replied, \"I think it would be pretty brutal. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas expressed confidence Thursday that Waltz would be confirmed and told reporters, \"I'm glad he's still going to be part of the administration.\"",
      "Wong served in the first Trump administration as deputy special representative for North Korea and also as deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the State Department. In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Wong helped negotiate his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "It is unlikely that U.S. envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff will be tapped for the permanent national security adviser job, two sources said. Speculation among Mr. Trump's allies on Thursday was that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller might be considered, or possibly deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism Seb Gorka, because they are so firmly behind Mr. Trump's mission. Ric Grenell, special presidential envoy for special missions, said publicly that he didn't want the post.",
      "The departures of Waltz and Wong come after at least six NSC staffers were fired in early April. Those previous firings came shortly after right-wing personality Laura Loomer visited the Oval Office and presented Mr. Trump with opposition research on NSC staffers whom she views as neoconservatives or not sufficiently loyal to the president, one source said.",

      "Earlier this year, the Oklahoma State Board of Education approved a proposal requiring students to submit their immigration status during school enrollment. Walters said he would share that data with federal authorities. The proposal must still receive the approval of the Oklahoma Legislature, which started considering it last week and could vote on it this month.",
      "\"Well, we're following their executive order,\" said Walters, in reference to an executive order Mr. Trump signed immediately after beginning his second term that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests near schools and places of worship. \"So, when you have an executive order that says, no longer will churches and schools not give over information that they're asked for, we took that seriously in Oklahoma. So we began to implement it. Well, if you need to get information from us and from our schools, you have to first collect the information.\"",
      "Walters' position on the issue has angered some students and teachers in the state. A visit to Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa in late January drew dozens of protesters.",
      "But one of Walters' loudest and most surprising critics is conservative Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who first met Walters at a tennis match and helped launch his political career.",
      "He doesn't believe the Trump administration is actually requesting the immigration status of students.",
      "\"Every time I've heard President Trump talk about this, he's talking about making sure we know who's coming in our country,\" Stitt told CBS News. \"And then also making sure that we get the criminal element out. I've never once heard him say, 'I want to go gather up 8-year-olds' immigration status.\"",
      "When asked about the issue, a White House official told CBS News that it doesn't want undocumented immigrants \"or gangs to take refuge and hide out in schools or churches because they know law enforcement can't go inside.\"",
      "The official added that it is \"not a directive\" for Department of Homeland Security agents \"to go into a school or church.\"",
      "\"Our agents use discretion,\" the official said. \"They would also need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or a school. We expect these to be extremely rare.\"",
      "The governor, meanwhile, has replaced three Oklahoma State Board of Education members after Walters proposed checking students' immigration status.\u00a0 \u00a0\"When I found that out, I was going to pull every lever I could to unwind that rule,\" Stitt said.",
      "Walters couldn't disagree more.",
      "\"The governor's absolutely dead wrong on this,\" countered Walters, who said Stitt's position on the immigration status won't perturb him.",
      "\"No, look, we're going to move forward with what we're doing,\" Walters said. \"The reality is we are following executive orders.\"",

    "summary": "The number of illegal crossings during President Trump's first three full months in office represent a seismic change at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
    "story": [
      "The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border unlawfully continued to be at a historically low level in April, three full months into President Trump's aggressive efforts to curtail illegal immigration, according to internal federal data obtained by CBS News.",
      "In April, Border Patrol agents recorded roughly 8,400 apprehensions of migrants who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security statistics, which have not been officially published.",
      "April's preliminary tally, which could be adjusted once the data is officially published, is a slight increase from March, when Border Patrol recorded 7,200 apprehensions at the southern border. And it is nearly identical to the 8,300 apprehensions the agency recorded there in February.",
      "The number of illegal crossings during Mr. Trump's first three full months in office represents a seismic change at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The apprehensions reported in February, March and April are the lowest tallies recorded by the Border Patrol in its public monthly dataset, which stretches back to fiscal year 2000. The last time Border Patrol averaged fewer than 9,000 monthly apprehensions along the southern border over a year was in the late 1960s, according to historical agency figures.",
      "The historically low levels of illegal crossings under Mr. Trump also stand in sharp contrast to the unprecedented influx in migrant arrivals at the southern border under the Biden administration. During a record-breaking spike in illegal crossings in December 2023, Border Patrol averaged 8,000 apprehensions per day, with the agency processing over 10,000 migrants on some days.",
      "Driving the dramatic drop in illegal entries at the southern border, Trump administration officials have argued, is the president's far-reaching immigration crackdown.",
      "Arguing that the country is facing an \"invasion,\" the president has all but shuttered the American asylum system, authorizing U.S. border officials to rapidly deport migrants to Mexico or their home countries, without court hearings. Thousands of additional active-duty troops have been deployed to fortify the southern border and, in some cases, detain migrants.",
      "The Trump administration has also dismantled Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally, arguing that the policies were contrary to federal immigration law.",
      "In the interior of the country, the administration has dramatically broadened who is eligible to be arrested and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reversing Biden-era rules that largely limited immigration arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals.",
      "In some cases, the administration has flown migrant detainees to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, as well as to El Salvador, where nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members remain detained at a notorious mega-prison.",
      "Many Democrats have denounced Mr. Trump's immigration policies as draconian and inhumane, arguing they have trampled on migrants' due process rights. Nearly every single major immigration and border policy enacted by the president faces legal challenges by Democratic-led states and advocates who argue the changes violate U.S laws, including obligations to asylum-seekers fleeing persecution.",
      "Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, who studies U.S. immigration policies at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and actions are likely contributing to migrants rethinking plans to cross the U.S. border.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh said it's \"one thing to be sent back to your home country if you have a fear, but to be sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador is an entirely different threat.\"",
      "Migration to the southern border, Putzel-Kavanaugh added, began dropping last year, after the Biden administration convinced Mexican officials to stop more U.S.-bound migrants. Unlawful border crossings dropped further after President Biden sharply restricted asylum through an executive order in June 2024.",
      "Putzel-Kavanaugh cautioned that migration patterns can change rapidly, noting that crossings appear to have plateaued since the massive plunge in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office. Still, the U.S.-Mexico border remains the quietest it has been in decades.",
      "Rolando Salinas, the Democratic mayor of Eagle Pass, Texas, said his border town was \"ground zero\" during the migration crisis faced by the Biden administration. In late 2023, thousands of migrants crossed into the Eagle Pass area daily. But he said that has changed markedly since Mr. Trump took office.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during President Trump's first term, has had his membership in the Global Entry traveler program revoked, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Thursday.",
      "The move comes after Mr. Trump issued a memorandum last month that targeted Krebs for defending the integrity of the 2020 election, which the president has continued to baselessly claim was rigged against him. The directive instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to suspend security clearances held by Krebs and people working at entities associated with him, including at the cybersecurity company where he worked.",
      "Krebs, a CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst,\u00a0told the Wall Street Journal last month that he was resigning from that company, SentinelOne.",
      "Mr. Trump's memo also directed his administration to investigate Krebs' activities from his time in the federal government, including at CISA.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CBS News that Krebs is \"under active investigation by law enforcement agencies. That is a fact disqualifying him for Global Entry.\" CNN first reported that Krebs' Global Entry membership had been rescinded.",
      "Global Entry is a program run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that allows expedited clearance for travelers arriving in the U.S. who are pre-approved and low-risk. A person may not be eligible for the Global Entry program if they are the subject of an ongoing federal, state or local law enforcement agency, according to CBP.",
      "Krebs was fired by Mr. Trump in 2020 after he refuted the president's unsupported claims that the election was rife was widespread voter fraud. CISA had released a joint statement days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election saying that it was the \"most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"",
      "In announcing his decision to remove Krebs from his role as CISA director, Mr. Trump claimed the statement was \"highly inaccurate.\" While the president and his campaign mounted dozens of lawsuits challenging the integrity of the 2020 election, none were successful and claims of widespread fraud were refuted, including by Mr. Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has continued to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him and has undertaken numerous actions to take revenge against his political adversaries and critics now that he is back in the White House. In addition to Krebs, the president has signed executive orders punishing major law firms that employed former special counsel Robert Mueller and members of his team, even though they no longer work there.",
      "He has also directed his administration to take away security clearances held by former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his opponents in the 2024 and 2016 elections, respectively, and Biden, as well as members of his administration.",
      "Like the memo targeting Krebs, Mr. Trump issued another punishing Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who authored a book and op-ed under a pseudonym that criticized the president during his first term as \"impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.\"",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked the designation in February, which would have cleared the way for the migrants to lose their government-issued work permits and deportations protections on April 7. But a federal judge in California agreed to delay the move in late March and said her decision to terminate the TPS program for the Venezuelan migrants appeared to be \"predicated on negative stereotypes.\"",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide emergency relief to the Trump administration and pause the district court's order, leading the Trump administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "\"So long as the order is in effect, the secretary must permit hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so is 'contrary to the national interest,'\" Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in the administration's emergency appeal with the high court.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the program that allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas designated Venezuela for the Temporary Protected Status program, citing \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that prevented Venezuelans in the U.S. from returning to their home country. Mayorkas extended the designation in 2023 and then again just before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "But after Mr. Trump took office for his second term, Noem vacated that extension, finding that it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the program. The termination was set to take effect April 7.",
      "TPS beneficiaries and the National TPS Alliance filed a lawsuit in February challenging Noem's decision, and U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled in their favor and postponed Noem's termination from taking effect nationwide. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit then declined to pause that order.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said the district court's injunction \"wrested control of the nation's immigration policy away from the Executive Branch and imposed the court's own perception.\"",
      "\"The district court's decision undermines the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,\" he wrote, calling the lower court's order \"ill-considered.\"",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Trump administration is one of nearly a dozen involving Mr. Trump's second-term agenda that has landed before the Supreme Court. The decision to end the TPS program for Venezuelans is also among a bevy of actions taken by the Trump administration as part of its sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and efforts to restrict the relief that allows some migrants to come to the U.S. and stay.",

      "Multiple federal health officials said they were surprised by the announcement, which bypassed the usual procedures overseen by career scientists at the NIH and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA. Those reviews are intended to ensure that federal research money goes to the projects with the greatest scientific merit.",
      "The HHS says the initiative, dubbed \"Generation Gold Standard,\" aims to start clinical trials next year for universal influenza vaccines that could protect against any strain of the virus. It hopes to get a vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration by 2029.",
      "All of the money is being transferred to an influenza vaccine project called beta-propiolactone or BPL, according to emails seen by CBS News. Two officials said the decision to pour $500 million into a single vaccine platform is unusual, given the limited data on it.",
      "The transfer makes it effectively one of the largest awards to date from a BARDA effort to speed funding to new experimental vaccines and treatments, topping a previous award of $452 million to a company developing an experimental oral COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News that \"decision-making for project Generation Gold Standard was a collaborative process, between leaders of HHS, in an effort to direct funding for a BPL vaccine for all influenza threats, not just one.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal previously reported news of the project.",
      "The vaccine underwent testing for safety results earlier this year in a small study led by NIH researchers Dr. Matthew Memoli and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger. The research was what scientists call a Phase 1 study, the first step to researching a potential vaccine in humans.",

Two officials said it was unusual for a political appointee to handpick a project or researcher to be funded without vetting from career scientists or outside review.",
      "The money is coming from the \"Project NextGen\" initiative, a $5 billion effort launched under the Biden administration that had previously funded multiple research projects into studying potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.",
      "The NIH had previously awarded $62.4 million in grant money to researchers at seven universities working on \"pan-coronavirus\" vaccines.",
      "From BARDA, the department had also backed four vaccine makers going into larger Phase 2B clinical trials to study experimental COVID-19 vaccines, in awards totaling $551 million.",

      "\"This is an unusual case,\" Elsayed said in court, emphasizing that it was up to the court \"to determine whether the motion was made in good faith.\" He argued that the Justice Department had provided \"no explanation whatsoever\" for withdrawing the charges and questioned the lack of clarity regarding what legal process would follow.",
      "\"There will likely be additional proceedings,\" Elsayed said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos was facing a federal felony gun possession charge in Virginia. Charging documents in his criminal case made only a fleeting reference to MS-13. An immigration officer's affidavit said, \"FBI agents and TFOs also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro Santos' home.",
      "Villatoro Santos' attorney accused the Justice Department of misusing Rule 48(a) \u2014 the procedural tool used to dismiss the indictment \u2014 arguing it amounted to an attempt to bypass due-process protections. \"They want to deport him without due process,\" Elsayed said, referencing statements by Bondi and criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"The court has to dig deeper than just the basic motion,\" Elsayed argued, alleging \"prosecutorial harassment\" and drawing parallels to other politically sensitive case dismissals, including that of New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"The DOJ did not seek to remove this case without knowing what's coming next,\" Elsayed said, warning of a potential \"unlawful deportation\" and citing past instances when the administration had \"defied court orders\" in deportation cases.",
      "Government attorneys countered that the defense had already delayed the case beyond its initial request, arguing, \"The defendant cannot continue to tread water on the criminal docket.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration cannot rely on the wartime Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove from the U.S. a group of Venezuelan migrants who are being held at a facility in southern Texas.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by President Trump in his first term, is a significant setback for the president as he seeks to crack down on illegal immigration into the U.S. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, but Rodriguez's order permanently blocks the administration from using the AEA and Mr. Trump's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in the Southern District.",
      "Rodriguez's order clarifies that his permanent injunction does not prohibit administration officials from moving forward with removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "\"The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the president can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of TdA,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA through the proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.\"",
      "As a result of that finding, the judge said that the executive branch cannot use Mr. Trump's invocation of the AEA through his proclamation to detain or deport the Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas.",
      "The Trump administration, Rodriguez wrote in a 36-page opinion, does \"not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\" The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "\"The court ruled that the president lacks authority simply to declare that there's been an invasion of the U.S.\u00a0 and then invoke an 18th Century wartime authority during peacetime,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the Venezuelan migrants, said in a statement. \"Congress never meant for this law to be used in this manner and the court correctly ruled that the president's actions are subject to judicial scrutiny.\"",
      "Enacted in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act allows the president to assert broad powers when there is a \"declared war\" or when \"any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted to threatened\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "The law has only been invoked three times, and all during periods of declared wars. But Mr. Trump's March proclamation claimed that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" The measure claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "Shortly after the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas, who were subject to removal because of the proclamation, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeking to block the move.",
      "That lawsuit set off a series of events that played out in March and led the Supreme Court to allow removals under the Alien Enemies Act. But crucially, the high court said Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration were entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "As a result of that decision, the three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle facility sought relief in the Southern District of Texas. While they did not take issue with their detention, they challenged the Trump administration's ability to deport them based on the president's proclamation and the Alien Enemies Act, and denied being members of Tren De Aragua.",
      "In granting the Venezuelan migrants relief, Rodriguez said that a presidential declaration invoking the Alien Enemies Act must include \"sufficient factual statements\" or refer to other pronouncements that allow a court to determine whether the alleged actions satisfy the conditions to apply the law.",
      "\"Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope. The law does not support such a position,\" he wrote.",
      "Rodriguez also found that \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion,\" as used in the law, \"must involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.\" That action, however, does not need to be a precursor to an actual war, the judge said.",
      "\"As for the activities of the Venezuelan-directed TdA in the United States, and as described in the proclamation, the court concludes that they do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' for purposes of the AEA,\" Rodriguez wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's attempted use of the Alien Enemies Act has sparked similar challenges in judicial districts across the country where Venezuelan migrants facing removal under the president's proclamation are being detained. Federal judges in New York and Colorado have temporarily blocked deportations relying on the 225-year-old law while proceedings continue.",
      "The clash involving the migrants in South Texas, initially brought in Washington, D.C., led a judge there to find probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. That finding arose from what the judge said was immigration officials' defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act that was bound for El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris made her highly anticipated return to the public stage Wednesday in San Francisco, delivering her first major speech since losing the 2024 presidential election to President Trump in the city where her political rise began.",
      "Harris gave the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that assists Democratic women in running for office.",
      "In her speech, which comes on the heels of\u00a0Mr. Trump's 100th day in office, Harris took aim at her former opponent, saying that \"instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals.\"",
      "Harris said that the Trump administration and his allies are \"counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others.\"",
      "Harris called Mr. Trump's trade war the \"greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history,\" describing the president's tariffs as \"reckless.\"",
      "Harris said the tariffs instituted by the Trump administration have \"hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials\" and are paralyzing \"American businesses, large and small, forcing them to lay off people, to stop hiring or pause investment decisions.\"",
      "She later added that \"the tariffs, as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession.\"",
      "\"But please, let us not be duped into thinking everything is chaos. It may feel like that,\" Harris said. \"But understand: What we are, in fact, witnessing is a high velocity event, where a vessel is being used for the swift implementation of an agenda that has been decades in the making.\"",
      "Harris also touched on Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, saying \"it is not OK to detain or disappear American citizens without due process.\"",
      "The Trump administration has faced ongoing controversy over the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who the Justice Department has admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security last week also sent a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras with her mother, who is undocumented.",
      "The former vice president praised \"the courage of judges to uphold the rule of law in the face of those who would jail them,\" a reference to the federal arrest of a Wisconsin judge last week accused of obstructing immigration agents.",
      "Harris ended her speech by acknowledging that \"things are going to get worse before they get better,\" but called on Americans to \"stand together\" and \"gear up for the hard work ahead.\"",
      "\"Always remember: This country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to we the people.\"",
      "The former vice president focused her speech on criticizing the Trump administration, stopping short of announcing a run for California governor or any other office.",
      "With Gov. Gavin Newsom terming out of the governor's office in 2026, Harris' name has been floated as a possible candidate to become California's next chief executive. Some polling has shown Harris garnering strong support for a run.",
      "Harris has mostly kept a lower profile since the election. She was in attendance at Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "Earlier in April, Harris attended the Leading Women Defined Summit event and gave a talk that possibly hinted at some of the themes she expanded on in Wednesday's speech.",
      "\"We're seeing people stay quiet. We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats,\" Harris said.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort aimed at blocking President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in the Senate amid anxiety over how the wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy fell short on Wednesday, with Senate Republicans largely united in their opposition.",
      "In a 49 to 49 vote, all but three Republicans opposed the measure, in a victory for the White House and GOP leadership in the Senate as the party seeks to remain united on the issue. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\"",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",

      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:39:24 -0400",
    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

      "Researchers have successfully launched a new satellite that is designed to study the planet's forests and \"provide unprecedented insight\" into how those regions impact the Earth's carbon cycle, the European Space Agency\u00a0 announced on Tuesday.",
      "The satellite, named Biomass, launched with a rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, New Guinea, and separated from the rocket less than an hour after launch,\u00a0 the ESA said in a news release. About 75 minutes after the launch, ESA satellite controllers received Biomass' first signal, indicating that the satellite is working as expected in orbit.",
      "Over the next few days, controllers will carry out the satellite's \"launch and early orbit\" phase, making sure that all systems are working well, the ESA said, and the satellite will make a \"series of intricate maneuvers\" to deploy a nearly 40-foot-wide mesh reflector. That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",
      "\"With Biomass, we are poised to gain vital new data on how much carbon is stored in the world's forests, helping to fill key gaps in our knowledge of the carbon cycle and, ultimately, Earth's climate system,\" said Simonetta Cheli, the ESA's director of Earth observation programs.",
      "Once the radar takes the measurements, the data will be received by the large mesh reflector. It will then be sent to the ESA's mission control center.",

    "summary": "Bree Smith, a Nashville mom, says the deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly a decade, Bree Smith was a familiar face in Nashville. But, in January, the mom and former TV meteorologist stopped appearing on the local CBS-affiliated station \u2014 a decision she made after months of fighting against deepfakes, which are simulated online images or videos that can seem realistic.",
      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43. She recalled first learning about the images in an email, which included a screen grab of an exchange between the sender and an \"impersonator\" posing as the doctored version of her on the internet.",
      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith. She began to keep track of new accounts using the deepfake in a Google spreadsheet \u2014 and added 24 over the course of just one week, among hundreds that she says have emerged online. A fabricated video also surfaced where a deepfake claims to be Smith.",
      "\"You're basically taking someone's identity,\" she said. \"You're weaponizing them.\"",
      "Smith has become a vocal advocate for regulations that could empower sextortion victims to fight back against their offenders. And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",
      "\"These imposters are trying to take my story, and my story is mine,\" Smith said. \"This is my life. I'm 43 years old and I have worked hard and I have loved well, and I'm not going to just roll over and take this.\"",
      "She said \"defining it as illegal is a critical first step,\" but that work still needs to be done, such as figuring out how to stop it and hold people accountable.",
      "As the bill worked its way through the Tennessee legislature, Smith appeared last month before the Tennessee House Criminal Justice Subcommittee to share her experience with deepfakes and the ways in which the scam has impacted her and her family. In her testimony to lawmakers, she said deepfake accounts pretending to be her have shown up on Facebook and Instagram, in quantities too large for her to find and report as an individual person, CBS News affiliate WSMV reported.",
      "\"I try my best to catch the imposters and block them, but like I said, there have been hundreds of them. It's like whack a mole, they just appear everywhere,\" Smith told lawmakers. \"I'm just supposed to look at them and say, 'nothing we can do, bud?'\"",
      "There were over 34,000 victims of sextortion in 2023, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. That number climbed to more than 54,000 victims last year. The FBI said financial sextortion, which differs from typical sextortion as it involves an offender threatening to release explicit material unless a payment is met, has been on the rise in the U.S. and targeting minors.",
      "Hayley Elizondo, who tracks sextortion crimes at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said financial gain is the perpetrators' primary goal.",
      "\"These offenders, their whole game is to make money,\" she said. \"I'm not surprised that we are seeing adults also become the target of financial sextortion. Frankly, they're going to reach out to those who can pay them.\"",
      "Officials say the most important thing for people to do if they think they are a victim of deepfakes is to report them.",
      "\"If you come across deepfake content that involves you or someone you know, report it to the platform hosting the content,\" says the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a nonprofit organization. \"This can help in having it removed or investigated, limiting its potential reach.\"",
      "The organization also advises reporting it to federal law enforcement, which can be done through the Internet Crime Complaint Center.",

But his ceramics took off with fans dubbed \"Potheads,\" who buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. And so, about 18 months ago, Alex decided it was time to use his own name \u2013 and to grace his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear. Correspondent Lee Cowan reports.",

    "story": [
      "Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died, her agent confirmed to CBS News on Friday. She was 88.",
      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said in a statement. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi's Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \"She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\"",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",
      "She was first spotted by \"Laugh-In\" creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on \"The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.\"",
      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \"Laugh-In\" when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\"I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\" he wrote in his 2023 memoir \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\" \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \"Laugh-In,\" her most frequent target was Arte Johnson's dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that's almost everyone at some time or other.\"",
      "Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others.",
      "Her other recurring characters on \"Laugh-In\" included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant.",
      "\"I never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. \"I was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.\"",
      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \"Laugh-In\" co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",
      "Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show \"The Entertainers,\" whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart.",
      "She was in the original Broadway cast of \"Sweet Charity\" with Gwen Verdon in 1966.",
      "Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas.",
      "She was a semi-regular on \"That Girl\" as Marlo Thomas' friend. She co-starred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on \"The Lost Saucer\" in the mid-1970s.",
      "Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams.",
      "She appeared in Ball's last comedy series, \"Life With Lucy.\"",
      "Buzzi guested in music videos with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the B-52's and the Presidents of the United States of America.",
      "She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including \"Pound Puppies,\" \"Berenstain Bears,\" \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Angry Beavers.\"",
      "She received an Emmy nomination for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on \"Sesame Street.\"",
      "Her movie credits included \"Freaky Friday,\" \"Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,\" \"The North Avenue Irregulars,\" and \"The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.\"",
      "Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as \"I have never faked a sarcasm\" and \"Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.\"",
      "She married Perkins, an actor, in 1978.",
      "The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville.",

    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on a tax loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, new federal data shows, a sign the labor market is still humming despite ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger than expected in April, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Payroll gains exceeded economist forecasts of 135,000 last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, matching forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The data suggests the labor market remains healthy despite rising concerns about how the Trump administration's tariff policies will impact economic activity.",
      "Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a research note that the stronger-than-expected pace of job-creation last month shows the risks of a recession are low, at least for now.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here. You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \"bias\" in the broadcasters' reporting.",
      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \"to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media post announcing the signing, said the outlets \"receive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half-a-billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Mr. Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "NPR, which was was established in 1970, released a\u00a0statement on Friday regarding the funding cuts, saying, \"This is not about balancing the federal budget.\"",
      "\"The President's order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities. It is also an affront to the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information. Although federal funding is an essential aspect of public media, significant financial support comes from listeners, underwriters, and philanthropic grants,\" the statement reads.",
      "Addressing reporters last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0he \"would love to\" cut funding to NPR and PBS.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS' CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration's effort to rescind funding for public media would \"disrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\"",
      "\"There's nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\" she said. \"This public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\"",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Mr. Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",

    "summary": "Catina Salarno's sister, Nina Salarno, became a prosecutor in California to warn others about a common tactic abusers use.",
    "story": [
      "When 18-year-old Catina Rose Salarno arrived at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, to begin her freshman year in September 1979, she thought she was starting life anew. She had broken up with her high school sweetheart, Steven Burns, and was excited to pursue her dream of becoming a dentist. But on her first day of college, he surprised her by showing up on campus. He asked to meet her for one last time later that evening, said Catina Salarno's college roommate, Joanne Marks.",
      "\"She was not looking forward to meeting with him, but she was looking forward to it being the last time,\" Marks told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty in this week's all-new episode,\u00a0\"The Boy Across the Street,\" airing Saturday, May 3 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. \"She believed that he would stop bothering her,\" said Marks.",
      "Around 8 p.m. that evening, Burns led Catina Salarno to a dark and secluded part of campus to talk about their relationship. But when she refused to get back together with him, he pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Catina in the back of the head, leaving her to slowly bleed to death.",
      "\"My whole world got taken from me in, really, the flash of the gun, I mean, everything was gone. My life was never the same again,\" Catina Salarno's youngest sister, Nina Salarno, told \"48 Hours.\" She was only 14 years old when Burns was convicted of second-degree murder in 1980, but her sister's death and its aftermath changed the course of her life.",
      "Nina Salarno went on to become a prosecutor specializing in domestic violence cases and has served as the district attorney in Modoc County, California, since 2023. \"I chose \u2026 to make that my career because I believed, like my sister, so many victims are either not heard, afraid to be heard, or just don't understand the magnitude of what's happening to them,\" she said.",
      "In 1977, Burns and his family moved across the street from the Salarnos' San Francisco home, and a romance blossomed between Catina Salarno and Burns \u2013 both sophomores in high school. While Catina Salarno attended the all-girls high school, Burns became the captain of his school's football team. Burns had a strained relationship with his own father, and the Salarnos took him in as one of their own. He was someone each member of the family grew to trust.",
      "By the end of their senior year, Catina Salarno wanted to break off their romantic relationship. When she started to pull away from Burns, his demeanor towards Catina became more aggressive, said Nina Salarno. And that behavior continued to escalate. Both of Catina's sisters told \"48 Hours\" about troubling incidents when Burns had threatened to kill Catina. But Nina Salarno said Catina never took those threats seriously. Neither did her sisters.",
      "\"We just figured he was just saying it. And because of what our relationship was over the years, why would we believe that?\" Catina's middle sister, Regina Salarno-Novello, told \"48 Hours.\" \"He enjoyed being part of the family. Why would he destroy a family that he loved?\"",
      "Nina Salarno said it's common for victims to miss the warning signs.",
      "\"I think this is what's really hard for domestic violence victims \u2014 they really don't think the person's gonna kill them \u2026 in a lot of the situations they think \u2026 they know this person \u2026 And I think that's exactly what happened with Catina is she just figured his comment was just his comment. Even though he had made threats, she could handle it, 'he's never gonna cross that line' type thing,\" she said.",
      "Which is why Catina Salarno agreed to meet Burns that night, Nina Salarno said.",
      "\"I think she gained strength as she was leaving the relationship \u2026 she was not gonna let him ruin where she was headed or interfere with her life anymore. And so that's why I believe she went out to meet him,\" Nina Salarno said. \"And I think she did probably one of the most courageous acts. But also in the history of domestic violence in relationships, it's the most dangerous time. And unfortunately, she was killed.\"",
      "According to Nina Salarno, once an abuser starts to feel like they have lost control over their partner, she says that is when the highest rate of injury or murder occurs in a domestic violence relationship. Nina Salarno emphasizes the importance of avoiding these \"last time\" encounters by urging victims to make a clean break from their abuser and avoiding situations where they might be alone with them.",
      "\"I think the biggest thing that a victim needs to realize is once they make that break, you've gotta make that break. Don't go meet them by yourself, don't take the phone calls, don't take the texts. Cut it off,\" Nina said. \"Everything you can do to prevent being one-on-one with that person.\"",
      "If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence or the threat of domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline\u00a0for help at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).",

    "summary": "Army plans for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday in June include military vehicles and \"thousands\" of troops.",
    "story": [
      "The Army is planning for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday in June that would include \"thousands\" of troops, as well and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, a defense official confirmed.",
      "According to planning documents obtained by the AP, the parade calls for over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians.",
      "The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted.",
      "The Army anniversary coincides with Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14.",
      "A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\" said Butler. \"We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\"",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely. Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the military Thursday night, though he didn't mention plans for June 14. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \"We are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" He said he would rename May 8 \u2014 known as Victory in Europe Day \u2014 as \"Victory Day for World War II\" and change Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, to \"Victory Day for World War I.\"",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \"significant concerns regarding security requirements\" as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn't know if the event was being \"characterized as a military parade\" but added that tanks rolling through the city's streets \"would not be good.\"",
      "\"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

      "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status. It's what they deserve!\" the president said in a post to Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details about the effort to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization, but he has floated taking such a step as recently as last month.",
      "Roughly 2 million organizations have received tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, including charities like churches, environmental groups and universities. The designation means the groups are exempt from paying federal income taxes and the IRS considers donations to 501(c)(3) organizations to be tax-deductible.",
      "The tax code prohibits executive branch officials from asking an IRS employee to conduct or terminate an audit or investigation into a specific taxpayer.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission. The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth. There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,\" a Harvard spokesperson said in response to Mr. Trump.",
      "The spokesperson continued: \"Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision is the latest in a series of moves targeting the university. His administration announced last month that it would be freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after the university rejected a series of demands made by the administration. Among the conditions were for Harvard to discontinue its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, positions and initiatives, change its hiring practices and change its leadership.",
      "After the Trump administration announced it would be freezing the funding to Harvard, the university sued and alleged the move was unlawful. It's likely a withdrawal of Harvard's tax-exempt status will prompt further legal action.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security also demanded Harvard turn over information on certain foreign student visa holders or risk losing its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. There were more than 6,700 international students enrolled at the school as of October, according to data from the university.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard in a letter to the school of creating a \"hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard's failure to condemn antisemitism.\"",
      "CBS News reported last month that the IRS was considering stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and Mr. Trump told reporters that he believed the school was abusing the designation.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said last month that any \"forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the president\" and said \"investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior to the president's TRUTH,\" a reference to an earlier suggestion by Mr. Trump that Harvard lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard has an endowment of $52.3 billion, the largest of all U.S. universities. The school provided more than $749 million in financial aid and scholarships in fiscal year 2024, and nearly one-third of funding that backs research at Harvard comes from the school.",

      "Rodriguez, who Ryan said will now be targeted for the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore later this month, is trained by Bob Baffert, who still has a horse set to enter the starting gate Saturday. Baffert is returning to the Derby after a three-year suspension from Churchill Downs following the now-deceased Medina Spirit's failed post-Derby drug test in 2021 and subsequent disqualification.",
      "Baffert's other horse in this year's Derby, Citizen Bull, is among the four colts in the race given 20-1 odds in the morning line. In California, Citizen Bull won the Robert B. Lewis Stakes in February, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November and the American Pharoah Stakes in October, and came in fourth in the Santa Anita Derby won by Journalism.",
      "The other three colts given 20-1 morning-line odds are East Avenue, Publisher and Tiztastic. On Friday morning, Grande, who was initially given the No. 10 post with those odds, was scratched from the Derby because of a foot bruise, according to trainer Todd Pletcher.",
      "But the odds aren't a crystal ball. The last time a morning-line favorite took first place at the Derby was in 2018, when Justify\u00a0won the Triple Crown. Last year, Mystik Dan got 20-1 odds in the morning line \u2014 which improved to 18-1 by post time \u2014 before winning the Derby. The bay colt launched from the No. 3 post, which Final Gambit drew for Saturday's Derby with 30-1 odds in the morning line.",

      "Luxor Caf\u00e9, with 15-1 morning-line odds, and Admire Daytona are the two colts who qualified for the Derby outside of the U.S. Luxor Caf\u00e9 won Japan's Fukuryu Stakes in March and the Hyacinth Stakes in February. Admire Daytona came in fourth in the Hyacinth Stakes and won the UAE Derby in the United Arab Emirates last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

      "The Senate on Thursday approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act and designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants that are emitted by heavy industry.",
      "The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law.",
      "Senate Republicans utilized the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2024.",
      "The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass.",
      "The rule\u00a0tied to the Clean Air Act\u00a0was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\"",
      "The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule.",
      "The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said that\u00a0the rule forced 1,800 facilities across the country\u00a0to tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law.",

      "\"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\"",
      "Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move.",
      "\"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy for\u00a0Mom's Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind \u2014 chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\"",
      "Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement,\u00a0\"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\"",

    "summary": "Jeffrey Hutchinson\u200b, 62, was the fourth person executed this year in Florida under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution set for May 15.",
    "story": [
      "An Army combat veteran whose Gulf War experience triggered severe mental problems was executed Thursday evening in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children.",
      "Jeffrey Hutchinson, 62, was pronounced dead at 8:15 p.m. following a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was the fourth person executed this year in Florida under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, with a fifth execution set for May 15.",
      "Hutchinson had no last statement but appeared to be mumbling to himself as the procedure started just before 8 p.m. His legs shook sporadically and he seemed to have body spasms for several minutes, then was still. The process took a little more than 15 minutes.",
      "The execution was carried out soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal without comment.",
      "Hutchinson had long claimed he was innocent and that two unknown assailants perpetrated the killings under a U.S. government conspiracy aimed at silencing his activism on claims including Gulf War illnesses involving veterans. Hutchinson served eight years in the Army, part of it as an elite Ranger.",
      "Court records, however, showed that on the night of the killings in Crestview, Florida, Hutchinson argued with his girlfriend, 32-year-old Renee Flaherty, then packed his clothes and guns into a truck. Hutchinson went to a bar and drank some beer, telling staff there that Flaherty was angry with him before leaving abruptly.",
      "A short time later, a male caller told a 911 operator, \"I just shot my family\" from the house Hutchinson and Flaherty shared with the three children: 9-year-old Geoffrey, 7-year-old Amanda, and 4-year-old Logan. All were killed with a 12-gauge shotgun that was found on a kitchen counter. Hutchinson was located by police in the garage with a phone still connected to the 911 center and gunshot residue on his hands.",
      "At his 2001 trial, Hutchinson's defense was based on his claim that two unknown men came to the house, killing Flaherty and the children after he struggled with them. A jury found Hutchinson guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison for Flaherty's killing and received three death sentences for the children.",
      "Hutchinson had filed numerous unsuccessful appeals, many focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service. In late April, his lawyers sought to delay his execution by claiming Hutchinson was insane and therefore could not be put to death.",
      "Bradford County Circuit Judge James Colaw rejected that argument in an April 27 order.",
      "\"This Court finds that Mr. Hutchinson's purported delusion is demonstrably false. Jeffrey Hutchinson does not lack the mental capacity to understand the reason for the pending execution,\" the judge wrote.",
      "In their court filings, Hutchinson's lawyers said he suffered from Gulf War Illness \u2014 a series of health problems stemming from the 1990-1991 war in Iraq \u2014 as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia related to his claim that he had been targeted by government surveillance.",
      "Florida's lethal injection protocol uses a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",
      "So far this year 15 people have been executed in the U.S. including Hutchinson. A fifth Florida execution is scheduled May 15 for Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing a woman at a motel in 1997. Rogers also was convicted of another woman's murder in California and is believed by investigators to have killed others around the country.",

    "summary": "Starbucks plans to hire more baristas at thousands of stores starting in May as the coffee chain looks to improve customer service.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

      "Senior U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton on Wednesday dismissed criminal charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, a Virginia man accused of being a regional leader of the violent MS-13 gang, clearing the way for expedited deportation proceedings.",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department asked the court to drop the charges, indicating the government planned to deport Villatoro Santos. A U.S. marshal from the Fugitive Task Force was in the courtroom, suggesting Villatoro Santos could be transferred into immigration custody after the hearing.",
      "\"They're likely to take him very quickly,\" Villatoro Santos' defense attorney, Muhammad Elsayed, said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos' arrest was announced last month in a nationally televised news conference featuring Attorney General Pam Bondi, who alleged he was the \"East Coast leader\" of the MS-13 transnational gang. He was accused of unspecified violent crimes and helping to lead the gang's criminal attacks across the country. But as the Justice Department has pursued the dismissal of charges against Villatoro Santos, it has not publicly tied him to any acts of violence. His attorneys have repeatedly questioned the nature of the proceedings.",
      "\"This is an unusual case,\" Elsayed said in court, emphasizing that it was up to the court \"to determine whether the motion was made in good faith.\" He argued that the Justice Department had provided \"no explanation whatsoever\" for withdrawing the charges and questioned the lack of clarity regarding what legal process would follow.",
      "\"There will likely be additional proceedings,\" Elsayed said after the hearing.",
      "Villatoro Santos was facing a federal felony gun possession charge in Virginia. Charging documents in his criminal case made only a fleeting reference to MS-13. An immigration officer's affidavit said, \"FBI agents and TFOs also observed indicia of MS-13 association in the garage bedroom\" of Villatoro Santos' home.",
      "Villatoro Santos' attorney accused the Justice Department of misusing Rule 48(a) \u2014 the procedural tool used to dismiss the indictment \u2014 arguing it amounted to an attempt to bypass due-process protections. \"They want to deport him without due process,\" Elsayed said, referencing statements by Bondi and criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security.",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration cannot rely on the wartime Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove from the U.S. a group of Venezuelan migrants who are being held at a facility in southern Texas.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by President Trump in his first term, is a significant setback for the president as he seeks to crack down on illegal immigration into the U.S. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who he claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, but Rodriguez's order permanently blocks the administration from using the AEA and Mr. Trump's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in the Southern District.",
      "Rodriguez's order clarifies that his permanent injunction does not prohibit administration officials from moving forward with removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
      "\"The question that this lawsuit presents is whether the president can utilize a specific statute, the AEA, to detain and remove Venezuelan aliens who are members of TdA,\" Rodriguez wrote. \"As to that question, the historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA through the proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms.\"",
      "As a result of that finding, the judge said that the executive branch cannot use Mr. Trump's invocation of the AEA through his proclamation to detain or deport the Venezuelan migrants in southern Texas.",
      "The Trump administration, Rodriguez wrote in a 36-page opinion, does \"not possess the lawful authority under the AEA, and based on the proclamation, to detain Venezuelan aliens, transfer them within the United States, or remove them from the country.\" The decision is likely to be appealed.",
      "\"The court ruled that the president lacks authority simply to declare that there's been an invasion of the U.S.\u00a0 and then invoke an 18th Century wartime authority during peacetime,\" Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the Venezuelan migrants, said in a statement. \"Congress never meant for this law to be used in this manner and the court correctly ruled that the president's actions are subject to judicial scrutiny.\"",
      "Enacted in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act allows the president to assert broad powers when there is a \"declared war\" or when \"any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted to threatened\" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.",
      "The law has only been invoked three times, and all during periods of declared wars. But Mr. Trump's March proclamation claimed that the gang Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" The measure claimed that the gang is undertaking \"hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare\" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as \"alien enemies.\"",
      "Shortly after the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas, who were subject to removal because of the proclamation, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeking to block the move.",
      "That lawsuit set off a series of events that played out in March and led the Supreme Court to allow removals under the Alien Enemies Act. But crucially, the high court said Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration were entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained.",
      "As a result of that decision, the three Venezuelan migrants detained at the El Valle facility sought relief in the Southern District of Texas. While they did not take issue with their detention, they challenged the Trump administration's ability to deport them based on the president's proclamation and the Alien Enemies Act, and denied being members of Tren De Aragua.",
      "In granting the Venezuelan migrants relief, Rodriguez said that a presidential declaration invoking the Alien Enemies Act must include \"sufficient factual statements\" or refer to other pronouncements that allow a court to determine whether the alleged actions satisfy the conditions to apply the law.",
      "\"Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch's authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute's scope. The law does not support such a position,\" he wrote.",
      "Rodriguez also found that \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion,\" as used in the law, \"must involve an organized, armed force entering the United States to engage in conduct destructive of property and human life in a specific geographical area.\" That action, however, does not need to be a precursor to an actual war, the judge said.",
      "\"As for the activities of the Venezuelan-directed TdA in the United States, and as described in the proclamation, the court concludes that they do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' for purposes of the AEA,\" Rodriguez wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's attempted use of the Alien Enemies Act has sparked similar challenges in judicial districts across the country where Venezuelan migrants facing removal under the president's proclamation are being detained. Federal judges in New York and Colorado have temporarily blocked deportations relying on the 225-year-old law while proceedings continue.",
      "The clash involving the migrants in South Texas, initially brought in Washington, D.C., led a judge there to find probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court. That finding arose from what the judge said was immigration officials' defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act that was bound for El Salvador.",

Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, did not vote.",
      "\"Senator Whitehouse is on his way back from representing the United States at the Our Ocean summit, where he was the sole American official,\" a spokesperson for the Senator said in a statement explaining his absence. \"The Senator expressed America's continued support for the Blue Economy, climate solutions, fisheries, and maritime security, even as the Trump administration cedes leadership on the oceans to the rest of the world.\"",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, would terminate the April 2 national emergency that the president is using to impose the tariffs, effectively blocking the sweeping levies on foreign imports. Along with Paul, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats and independents in support of the measure, falling short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.",
      "The vote came after the president on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China.",
      "Wyden told CBS News ahead of the vote of the measure's chances that \"this is a choice for senators.\"",
      "\"They've been home and they've heard from their constituents, like small businesses, that are getting clobbered by these tariffs,\" Wyden said. \"If they're going to listen to their constituents, we'll get their support, and if they're more concerned about Donald Trump being mean to them, they'll go with opposition.\"",
      "Paul admonished his fellow Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Wednesday, saying \"this should not be a partisan issue\" and noting that \"Congress didn't debate these tariffs, Congress didn't vote to enact these tariffs \u2014 the tariffs are simply imposed by presidential fiat.\"",
      "\"If Americans are to live under this emergency rule, it will not be because the president sought too much power,\" Paul said. \"It will be because Congress let it happen.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Senate approved another resolution to block Mr. Trump's tariffs on Canada, which fall under an earlier national emergency. At the time, four Republicans joined all Democrats and independents to support the measure \u2014 Murkowski, Collins and McConnell, along with Paul. The House did not vote on the measure.",
      "Mr. Trump had put pressure on Senate Republicans to oppose the measure, calling out the senators expected to support it by name. But those senators held fast in their opposition.",
      "Ahead of the vote this time around, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Vice President JD Vance joined the conference during their launch meeting on Tuesday, where senators said Greer told them the administration is making progress on trade deals.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Earlier this month, Republicans included in a key piece of legislation a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block the tariffs announced on April 2, after also doing so with the earlier tariffs. And any measure to roll back the tariffs would need the president's signature, leaving opponents in Congress with little likelihood of reining in his levies.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday that it isn't appropriate for Congress to \"jump in\" a handful of weeks into the administration's tariff policy, saying at an Axios event that \"the executive has a broad array of authority that's been recognized over the years\" on trade. But he suggested limited openness to stepping in down the road.",
      "\"If it gets close to where the imbalance is there, then we would step in,\" Johnson said, while adding that the first step would be for him to call the president to discuss the concerns. \"But right now I think ultimately this policy is going to achieve the desired outcome and it's going to be good for the country, and so we're applauding that.\"",
      "Still, anxieties continued to run high over the economic impact of the tariffs. And economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2025, the Commerce Department reported in its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday following the GDP report that \"the tariff issue is one that's probably going to take some time to realize the results and the benefits from.\"",
      "\"Overall, the things we're going to be doing to support a healthy economy, on taxes and regulations and energy, are going to have a positive impact long term,\" Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. \"The tariff issue is something that's, like I said, it's an open question, but we're giving them some space to negotiate and see if they can get some good deals.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:07:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Deaths from diabetes increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",
      "\"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data,\" Selvin said.",

The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",

Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports.

      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",

      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

    "summary": "A pro-Palestinian protest group that's tried for years to breach Israel's Gaza blockade with ships carrying aid says one of its vessels was attacked by drones off Malta.",
    "story": [
      "The Freedom Flotilla Coalition campaign group said Friday that one of its ships bound for the Gaza Strip, carrying aid and dozens of activists, was attacked in international waters by drones in the middle of the night off Malta, causing serious damage to the vessel. The group, which has campaigned against Israel's blockade of the war-torn Palestinian territory and tried for years to reach it with boats carrying humanitarian aid, did not report any casualties, and Maltese officials said a fire on the vessel had been brought under control.",
      "The Reuters news agency cited Malta's government as saying in a statement that the fire was out but the ship was still being monitored by relevant authorities.",
      "The Freedom Flotilla said in an earlier social media post that the ship's hull had been breached and it was taking on water, prompting the crew to issue a distress call. There were about 30 activists on board the vessel, the organization said. Nighttime photos and video shared by the group showed what it said was a fire toward the front of a vessel.",
      "The group did not immediately attribute the drone attack to any nation or group, and there were no claims of responsibility issued.",
      "Israeli forces have previously boarded and seized Freedom Flotilla vessels to prevent them from breaching the Gaza blockade, including a raid on a boat in 2010 that left at least nine activists dead.",
      "CBS News asked the Israel Defense Forces on Friday if it carried out any operation involving the Freedom Flotilla ship near Malta. There was no immediate response from the IDF.",
      "Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, said in a social media post on Friday that she had \"received a distressed call from the people of the Freedom Flotilla that is carrying essential food and medicine to the starving Gaza population. I call on concerned state authorities, including maritime authorities, to support the ship and its crew as needed. I trust the competent authorities will also ascertain the facts and intervene appropriately.\"",
      "Aid organizations have condemned Israel's blockade, which, since the end of March,\u00a0has been strictly enforced\u00a0to prevent any goods entering the Palestinian territory, including humanitarian supplies that aid workers say are desperately needed in the enclave. Much of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed during the war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which has also killed more than 52,000 people according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "Hamas and allied groups killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel in the 2023 attack and took 251 others as hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli officials, who've said as many as 24 of the captives could still be alive.",
      "In its statement, reported by Reuters, Malta's government said all those aboard the Freedom Flotilla vessel had been \"confirmed safe.\"",
      "\"The vessel had 12 crew members on board and four civilian passengers; no casualties were reported,\" the statement said, adding that a nearby tug had been directed to aid the vessel. \"The tug arrived on scene and began firefighting operations. By 1:28 a.m. (2328 GMT Thursday), the fire was reported under control. An Armed Forces of Malta patrol vessel was also dispatched to provide further assistance.\"",
      "\"By 2:13 a.m., all crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug ... The ship remains outside territorial waters and is being monitored by the competent authorities.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear why the activist group had reported nearly twice as many people being on the vessel as the Maltese authorities.",
      "The Freedom Flotilla describes itself as a \"solidarity movement composed of campaigns and initiatives from different parts of the world, working together to end the illegal Israeli blockade of Gaza.\"",
      "Among its goals with the defiant sailings to Gaza, the organization says it aims to \"condemn and publicize the complicity of other governments and global actors in enabling the blockade,\" including, \"most notably, the US government,\" which it says \"has underwritten Israel's violence against Palestinians for decades.\"",

      "The Trump administration on Thursday imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals \u2014 including one accused drug lord with a fondness for exotic animals and luxury cars \u2014 and two Mexico-based entities involved in a drug trafficking and fuel theft network linked to Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "It is one of Mexico's most powerful cartels and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says it has some 19,000 members in its ranks. The cartel developed rapidly into an extremely violent force after it split from the Sinaloa cartel after the 2010 killing of Sinaloa cartel capo Ignacio \"Nacho\" Coronel Villarreal by the military.",
      "The new sanctions against Jalisco New Generation, including top members Cesar Morfin Morfin (dubbed \"Primito\") and his brothers Alvaro Noe Morfin Morfin and Remigio Morfin Morfin, target the group's fuel theft network.",
      "U.S. officials allege Primito is involved in the transportation and distribution of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana into the United States.",
      "\"Primito's luxurious lifestyle has included ownership of exotic animals and dozens of luxury vehicles,\" the Treasury said in a news release, while releasing an image of a jaguar allegedly seized from Primito by Mexican authorities in December 2023.",
      "The Treasury Department says that network has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue to the Mexican government and also funds the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States.",
      "The sanctions freeze any assets the individuals or companies have in the U.S. and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.",
      "The U.S. administration has made it a priority to combat that flow, which has been blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that his department \"will continue to use all available tools to relentlessly target drug cartels and foreign terrorist organizations to Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "Paul Anthony Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council, said the sanctions actions \"will ensure that the cartels no longer have the ability to provide unlimited funds to further their criminal enterprises and allow the U.S. government \"to disrupt their daily activities on both sides of the border.\"",
      "In February, the administration designated Jalisco New Generation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\u00a0 The group has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and of\u00a0torturing and killing recruits\u00a0who resist. In March, a group of people looking for missing relatives found\u00a0charred bones, shoes and clothing\u00a0at a suspected training ground for the cartel.",
      "Thursday makes the eighth time the Trump Treasury Department has taken action against cartels. The Biden administration also imposed sanctions on the Jalisco New Generation group.",
      "The cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n Oseguera Cervantes, who is better known as \"El Mencho.\" Washington has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked Tuesday about the fight against fuel theft and smuggling, said her party in Congress was working to strengthen the government's tools so there will be \"traceability\" when it comes to fuel shipments.",
      "\"So that any tanker truck carrying fuel, whichever kind, we know: where it came from; where it's going; if it's imported, with what import permit did it enter, where was it stored, and from there to which service station is it going to be taken,\" Sheinbaum said. \"If a tanker has stolen fuel from a pipeline and is stopped on the highway, it has to show where that fuel came from; if it doesn't, there's something illegal.\"",
      "A man known as \"The Tank\" leads the cartel's fuel theft arm, supplying it with tens of millions of dollars a year by selling stolen gasoline through a network of seemingly legitimate businesses, according to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "The White House has linked fentanyl to President Trump's tariff plan, saying he wants \"to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.\"",

      "The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.",

      "Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \"exceptional museum grade piece.\"",
      "\"Not only is it written by one of the most important first-class passengers on Titanic, Colonel Archibald Gracie, [but] the letter itself contains the most prophetic line: 'It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her,'\" Aldridge said in a statement.",
      "Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \"The Truth about the Titanic,\" an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.",
      "Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.",
      "The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",
      "Henry Aldridge & Son put up dozens of Titanic items up for auction this month, including a pocket watch and a third-class ticket belonging to two passengers who both died in the disaster.",
      "Pocket watches previously owned by Titanic passengers have sold for huge amounts at Henry Aldridge & Son's auctions before, with a bidder in November claiming one of them\u00a0for $2 million. The price of that item had broken a record set earlier in the year, when the same auction house sold a different gold watch for about $1.46 million. In that case, the 14-carat object belonged to the wealthiest passenger on the Titanic,\u00a0John Jacob Astor, whose net worth was around $87 million when the disaster happened in 1912.",

      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password.\u00a02FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your accounts, even if they obtain your password.",
      "3. Regularly update your software and devices: Keeping your systems\u00a0up to date ensures you have the latest security patches and protections against newly discovered vulnerabilities.",
      "4.\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords: Use long, complex passphrases that are unique for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to help create and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Be cautious about sharing information: Avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information or passwords over text or phone calls unless you're absolutely certain of the recipient's identity. Be cautious of phishing attempts and verify the legitimacy of requests for personal information.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from people-search websites, making it harder for scammers to find and target you.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

      "5. Don't click that link and have strong antivirus software: Do not click on unsolicited pop-ups on your computer, links sent via text messages or email links and attachments. As scammers weaponize AI and deepfake technologies, strong antivirus software becomes your first line of defense.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",
      "That\u2019s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we\u2019ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved.",
      "But in the latest news, health insurance giant Blue Shield of California confirmed that it had been sharing private health data of 4.7 million users with Google for three years without even realizing it.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Impact on patients and the industry",
      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "The Blue Shield of California incident is a reminder that even well-known healthcare providers can mishandle sensitive data. While you can\u2019t always control what happens behind the scenes, there\u00a0are steps you can take to reduce your exposure and safeguard your privacy:",
      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Bonus privacy steps (For extra peace of mind)",
      "If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early:",
      "Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.",

      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",

      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",

      "7 points: Nailed it. Your password is strong and secure \u2014 just remember to keep it updated.",
      "This quick password strength test isn\u2019t just a quiz, it\u2019s a good reminder. Even one weak spot could be all it takes for someone to break in. In a world full of data leaks, a strong, unique password is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. So, what\u2019s your score? Think it\u2019s time to level up?",
      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",
      "Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process. By prioritizing strong passwords and using tools to help you manage them effectively, you can significantly reduce your risk and enjoy greater peace of mind online.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The United Nations\u2019 UN80 Task Force is examining multiple suggested methods for reorganizing the institution, according to a leaked, confidential document shared with Fox News Digital. The six-page paper cites multiple inefficiencies and areas of improvement needed to combat \"geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets\" which are \"challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organization.\"",
      "The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan,\u00a0former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N. Secretary-General election.\" Dugan said that \"the person with the fresh mandate\" should overhaul the U.N.",

      "The UN80 Task Force document notes that \"overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources, and inconsistent delivery of services\" are among the problems with proliferating agencies, funds and programs, and notes ways to integrate, consolidate, and coordinate among reformed entities to maximize the benefit for those who rely on the U.N.",
      "As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\"",
      "Dugan said the document \"looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat.\" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting \"the very best in the world,\" or \"identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.\"",
      "Dugan said that the task force is also missing the important confidence-building measures needed to increase buy-in from members, to keep them \"impressed and enthusiastic\" about U.N. programs. \"They\u2019re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time.\" Dugan said this is \"a real shortcoming.\"",

      "\"I don\u2019t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,\" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the \"Noah\u2019s Ark management mentality\" of attempting to \"weather the storm,\" Dugan said that the U.N. must \"get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.\"",
      "Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a \"fall-off in relevance\" with its lack of involvement in \"real world dynamics between member states.\" He urged the organization to identify \"the multilateral collateral, meaning we\u2019ve got to identify what\u2019s good, and then we have to get rid of what\u2019s damaged after eight years.\"",

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that the memo \"is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the Secretary-General\u2019s vision\" and is one \"of the three work streams that we are working on.\"",
      "Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.",

      "Dujarric also mentioned a speech Guterres gave eight years ago in September 2017, when he lamented the Byzantine bureaucracy that hampers progress at the U.N., and said that he was \"pursuing sweeping management reform \u2013 to simplify procedures and decentralize decisions, with greater transparency, efficiency and accountability.\"",
      "For Dugan, Guterres\u2019 failure to attempt those \"sweeping\" reforms prior to 2025 is an indication that regime change is needed. He reiterated that \"the Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Trust me\u2019 window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.\"",

      "The parents of the American hostages still held by the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza have called on President Donald Trump to use his reputation for being \"tough\" and apply pressure on not only known enemies but one of his closest allies: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "There are 59 hostages still in Gaza, at least 24 of whom are assessed to be alive, including American-Israeli Edan Alexander, now 21 years old after having spent two birthdays in Hamas captivity.",
      "Itay Chen, 19, Omer Neutra, 21, Judy Weinstein Haggai, 70, and her husband, Gadi Weinstein, 73, are all believed to have been killed by Hamas in it's attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken into Gaza.",

      "\"We asked of the president to keep everybody accountable,\" Alexander, who sat next to his wife, Yael, described after the second phase of a ceasefire, which was supposed to begin in March but failed and Israel resumed military operations in the Gaza Strip to the immense frustration of mediators.",
      "In addition, the families urged Trump to keep Netanyahu \"on a short leash\" and to \"get him back to negotiate as soon as possible and stop this thing.\"",
      "Trump this week marked his 100th day in office, and the families of the five Americans still held hostage urged him to reflect on his strategy and apply pressure on both Israel and Hamas, through both economic and diplomatic means, to secure the release of all 59 hostages.",
      "\"With the election results, we had such high hopes,\" Ruby Chen, father to Itay, told reporters during a press event on Wednesday. \"We know he cares about the topic, and we saw, even before the inauguration, his comments on the topic with the \u2018hell to pay\u2019 and \u2018all the hostages need to come out.\u2019\"",
      "\"But I think the 100-day mark that we are at this moment, I think it's a good time to reflect and say that the job's not done,\" said Chen, sitting next to his wife, Hagit Chen.",
      "Trump sparked international concern in February when he suggested the Gaza Strip should be turned into the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" and fears have mounted that as Washington continues to discuss potentially displacing Palestinians and Israel continues aggressive military operations, Hamas may be unwilling to give up its leverage: the hostages.",

      "\"It's easy rhetoric to say that Hamas won't hold their side of the deal,\" Orna Neutra, mother to Omer, told reporters. \"If they don't hold their side of the deal, then [Netanyahu] can return to hostilities.",
      "\"But let's allow them to release all hostages and see if that happens or not instead of just saying they won\u2019t do it,\" she added, noting it could be another leveraging point for the Trump administration.",
      "The families of the hostages are careful not to get overly involved in the heated political topics, but instead they have highlighted the importance of and need for a solid strategy to first secure the release of all remaining hostages, and then figure out a day-after plan.",
      "Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has suggested that Hamas could become politically active in the Gaza Strip, but they need to fully disarm.",
      "\"I think the best approach will be just to call for both parties to rise above politics, although it will be very difficult with Hamas, which is politically struggling to survive in this region, but definitely to call on [the] Israeli government to rise above politics,\" Alexander said. \"Do not think about politically surviving and prioritize human life.\"",
      "Emaciated Israeli hostages, from left, Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy, who were held hostage by Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, are taken by terrorists to a stage before being handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Feb. 8, 2025. (AP/Abdel Kareem Hana)",
      "The families pointed to polling from Israel that shows nearly 70% of Israelis favor ending military operations against Hamas in order to return all the hostages more than 573 days since they were abducted, including some 48% of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition base. Some 39% of his conservative base apparently oppose the strategy, and another 13% are unsure.",

      "\"Just to be clear, Hamas is the enemy,\" said Neutra, who sat next to her husband, Ronen. \"Hamas committed these atrocious crimes. They're holding on to our family members. We don't want to see them continue to be a threat to Israel.",
      "\"But it's about priority, and it's about being in the situation for 19 months now,\" she added.",

      "A leaked budget proposal sent on April 10 from the White House Office of Management and Budget to the U.S. State Department highlighted the Trump administration\u2019s posture toward Afghan allies, particularly those awaiting transportation to the U.S. through the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts (CARE) as part of Enduring Welcome.",
      "The OMB budget proposes ceasing additional funds to CARE and using the program\u2019s $600 million balance \"for the orderly shutdown of the CARE program by end of [fiscal year] 2025.\"",
      "The National Security Council and State Department did not answer Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether these funds would be used to transport additional Afghans in the Special Immigrant Visa and the suspended U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) pipelines to the U.S., or simply to disassemble processing platforms in the Philippines, Qatar and Albania.",

      "Veteran experts told Fox News Digital that the shutdown of CARE would be a problem for America\u2019s reputation and for the allies who believed in U.S. promises of safety.",
      "U.S. Navy veteran Shawn VanDiver, founder and president of the #AfghanEvac, told Fox News Digital that Operation Enduring Welcome is \"the safest, most secure legal immigration pathway our country has ever seen\" and allows well-vetted Afghans \"to show up in our communities and start businesses and become job creators\u2026 in a time when we have a labor shortage.\"",
      "VanDiver noted areas where Trump could improve on the Biden administration operation, which was carried out \"so slowly that people have been left behind in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, in 90 countries around the world\u2026 for three and a half years.\" Particularly in Pakistan, the Biden administration promised the Pakistani government \"that it would process Afghans quickly,\" VanDiver said. \"We haven\u2019t been keeping up our end of the deal; 10,000 people are stuck in Pakistan right now because President Biden couldn\u2019t house them fast enough.\"",

      "In an open letter sent on April 23 to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and national security advisor Michael Waltz, #AfghanEvac states that \"over 250,000 Afghans remain in the relocation pipelines.\"",
      "Andrew Sullivan, executive director of the nonprofit No One Left Behind, told Fox News Digital that his organization supported congressional authorization in 2024 for the three-year appointment of a Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, which had \"wide bipartisan\" and \"wide bicameral support.\"",

      "Ending Operation Enduring Welcome and the CARE program \"just spits in the face of veterans like myself, who\u2019ve been working to try and keep our promise to the Afghans who fought with us for 20 years,\" Sullivan said.",
      "In addition to two Iraq deployments, Sullivan deployed to Zabul, Afghanistan, as a U.S. Army infantry company commander in 2013.

      "\"In Albania, I met someone that had been paralyzed by the Taliban after being shot twice,\" Sullivan said. \"I met someone that had been tortured and shackled, hands and ankles together, for over a week before his release was secured by village elders.\" Both individuals were moved from Afghanistan in December 2024, which Sullivan says proves Afghans are still \"facing brutality, absolutely facing death, if they remain in the clutches of the Taliban.\"",
      "Sullivan says that \"those same things could happen\" to tens of thousands of Afghans left behind by the Biden administration.

      "President Donald Trump released a budget proposal Friday calling for a mix of cuts to domestic programs involving public health, education and clean energy, while seeking to increase spending on his priorities like border security and a bigger military.",
      "The 40-page request was addressed to congressional leaders and accompanied by a letter from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought addressed to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "Overall, Vought said the proposal contains a 23% cut ($163 billion) in discretionary funding, and a 13% increase in military spending.",
      "The White House budget comes as the Republican-led Congress is seeking to craft a massive bill for Trump\u2019s priorities of tax cuts, higher spending on immigration enforcement and the military, spending cuts in other parts of the federal government, and a debt limit increase. Vought mentions the calls for border funding in the new budget blueprint.",
      "White House budgets are usually symbolic and never become law as written. But they represent the president\u2019s vision for spending and tend to influence the debate on Capitol Hill. They also tend to be a vehicle for messaging on the White House\u2019s most popular priorities \u2014 and often propose difficult policy compromises or cuts that become the basis for political attacks from the opposition party.",
      "Trump\u2019s new proposals could affect the next round of government funding talks, with funding set to expire on Sept. 30 after passage of a six-month funding bill in early March. That legislation \u2014 unlike the party-line \"reconciliation\" bill \u2014 is subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate, meaning it will need significant Democratic support to become law in the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Trump's budget proposes a variety of steep cuts to well-known government programs, including cutting the National Institutes of Health by $18 billion compared to 2025 levels, the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP) by $4 billion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $3.6 billion.",
      "The budget also calls for various cuts to clean energy funding, education funding, scientific research and international aid.",
      "And it proposes a funding boost for Trump priorities, including a $43.8 billion boost to the Department of Homeland Security, a $113.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $500 million for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"MAHA\" \u2014 \"make America healthy again\" \u2014 priorities like promoting nutrition and exercise.",
      "The Trump proposal is limited to \"discretionary\" spending and excludes proposals on \"mandatory\" spending, the major part of the U.S. budget that covers safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet that's where difficult decisions on federal spending ultimately lie, with Medicaid proving to be a sticking point among Republicans as they consider their big bill on Trump's tax and spending priorities later this year.",
      "Trump's budget won praise from Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called it \"a bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American\u00a0strength\u00a0and\u00a0prosperity.\u201d",
      "\u201cHouse Republicans stand ready to work alongside\u00a0President\u00a0Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first,\" he said.",
      "It was slammed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who vowed that Democrats will \"fight this heartless budget with everything we\u2019ve got.\"",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"As he guts healthcare, slashes education, and hollows out programs families rely on \u2014 he\u2019s bankrolling tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. It\u2019s not just fiscally irresponsible, it\u2019s a betrayal of working people from a morally bankrupt president.\""

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Friday that he will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, the latest move in the escalating clash between the administration and the Ivy League school.",
      "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard\u2019s Tax Exempt Status. It\u2019s what they deserve!\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",
      "The president had previously suggested the university should lose its tax-exempt status. His latest statement came after Harvard sued the administration over its decision to freeze more than $2 billion in funding to the Ivy League school. The administration claimed the university was refusing to follow the administration's demands that it take actions aimed at ending antisemitism on campus.",
      "\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness?\u2019\u201d Trump threatened in a Truth Social post last month. He added, \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"",
      "Responding to Trump's announcement Friday, Harvard spokesperson Jason Newton said that the government has \"long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission\" and that there was no legal basis to rescind its status.",
      "\"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth,\" he said.",
      "Newton added that revoking the university's tax-exempt status \"would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission.\"",
      "\"It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation,\" he continued. \"The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Harvard accused the Trump administration of violating the First Amendment and other laws and regulations after it paused $2.2 billion in grants. The school called on a federal judge to declare the move unconstitutional and order the government to reinstate the funding.",
      "The federal government froze funding to Harvard after the school said it wouldn't comply with \"critical reforms\" called for by the Trump administration. Some of those changes included a demand for the discontinuation of diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as reforms to programs \"with egregious records of antisemitism or other bias.\"",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber told NBC News' Lester Holt last week that the research funded by the federal grants is unrelated to antisemitism, which the school said in its lawsuit it has taken steps to address on its campus since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cPutting that research at jeopardy because of claims of antisemitism seems to us to be misguided,\u201d Garber said. \u201cThe effort to address antisemitism will not be advanced by shutting off funding.\u201d",
      "Tax-exempt nonprofit groups, known as 501(c)(3) organizations, are prohibited from participating in certain political activities, according to the Internal Revenue Service. \"Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes,\" the agency's website says.",
      "Soon after Trump's Truth Social post, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and a group of other Senate Democrats sent a letter to the acting Treasury inspector general for tax administration requesting an investigation into the president's targeting of Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "\"It is both illegal and unconstitutional for the IRS to take direction from the President to target schools, hospitals, churches, or any other tax-exempt entities as retribution for using their free speech rights,\" they wrote the official, Heather Hill.",
      "They added, \"We request that you review whether the President or his allies have taken any step to direct or pressure the IRS to take politically-motivated actions regarding the tax exempt status of the President\u2019s political targets.\""

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry has lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly-funded security detail at Britain\u2019s High Court.",
      "King Charles III\u2019s second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is currently the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the royal family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Marco Rubio was just two weeks into his new job when he got a critical lesson in being President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. In Latin America on his first trip outside the United States since he became America\u2019s top diplomat, three senior administration officials said, Rubio was caught off guard by two policy decisions made in Washington: drastic changes to foreign aid and Trump\u2019s publicly backing turning the Gaza Strip into a Middle East Riviera.",
      "Rubio was similarly blindsided by foreign policy pronouncements from top administration officials two more times over the next 10 days.",
      "Since then, he has figured out a strategy to minimize such frustrations. First, he has adapted some of his foreign policy positions that, in the past, diverged from Trump\u2019s. Second, he has been on a MAGA charm offensive, recently dining at a Capitol Hill restaurant popular with Trump loyalists and appearing at an event hosted by a powerful pro-Trump activist organization. And he spends as much time as he can at the White House to be close to Trump, according to four senior administration officials.",
      "\u201cLook, it\u2019s a water cooler,\u201d one of the senior administration officials said of the West Wing. \u201cIn any job, you want to be at the water cooler.\u201d",
      "Now, Rubio\u2019s position in the Trump administration has significantly expanded, and it is likely to draw him closer to Trump, who announced Thursday that he also will take on the role of national security adviser. Trump said he would nominate his first national security adviser, Mike Waltz, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "Rubio will hold both positions for now, according to an administration official, and Trump isn\u2019t ruling out keeping him in both indefinitely. No one has been secretary of state and national security adviser simultaneously since the influential Henry Kissinger 50 years ago.",
      "Rubio also remains acting administrator of the diminished U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as acting archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration.",
      "It\u2019s a remarkable shift in fortunes for a secretary of state who sparred sharply with Trump in the past and who was at risk of being overshadowed by special envoys he tapped to take the lead on major global challenges. It\u2019s also a transformation that is born out of a concerted effort by Rubio to assert himself in a sprawling national security team and to find his footing in Foggy Bottom, as well as his place in Trump\u2019s orbit of longtime close advisers.",
      "This account of Rubio\u2019s first three months is based on interviews with more than a dozen senior current and former administration officials, congressional officials and other people who are close to Rubio or the White House and familiar with his tenure so far.",
      "Before Thursday\u2019s announcement, people close to Rubio and the White House said, he had increasingly become someone Trump relies on, more than he did in the early days of the administration. Foreign diplomats, too, have noticed the change.",
      "A European official said that, even relative to a month ago, Rubio\u2019s influence had grown \u2014 although with an evergreen caveat that when it comes to foreign policy, \u201cno one speaks for Trump.\u201d",
      "People close to Rubio, a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, said secretary of state has effectively been a dream job.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him happier,\u201d the senior administration official said.",
      "At the same time, the position has come with certain confines. Rubio and his team have, at times, felt the White House personnel office was blocking him from hiring more of his own staff members at the State Department, while national security officials who are seen as more MAGA were tapped for key roles. There also have been instances when Rubio\u2019s team has conveyed to the National Security Council that he wasn\u2019t always being looped in on decisions as much as he wanted.",
      "The senior administration official didn\u2019t directly address whether Rubio has been able to bring in the staff members he has wanted, saying, \u201cWe love the team that we have.\u201d",
      "Power struggles between the National Security Council and the State Department have been a fixture of many past administrations \u2014 one that could be diminished with Rubio serving in both positions. The senior administration official said Rubio and Waltz had a good relationship.",
      "The official stressed that Rubio had no ideological disagreement with the decision to dismantle USAID. After Trump announced the idea of a Riviera in Gaza, which would involve displacing Palestinians, Rubio issued a full-throated public endorsement of the idea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very well-coordinated national security team,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cWe\u2019re really satisfied with the communication flow and the decision-making that happens.\u201d",
      "A rocky start",
      "The Senate voted 99-0 to confirm Rubio \u2014 by far the largest margin for any of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees.",
      "But his uneven history with Trump \u2014 stemming from their, at times, bawdy exchanges of insults when they were both running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 \u2014 has led to a wariness from Trump\u2019s Republican base. It\u2019s also a different type of relationship from the ones Trump has with the other advisers he tapped for key diplomatic assignments. And in his White House, access to Trump is critical \u2014 and often pivotal when it comes to his decision-making process.",
      "Rubio hasn\u2019t had a designated workspace in the West Wing \u2014 though Waltz had a prime corner office on the main floor. Rubio has been ducking into an unused office to make calls when he\u2019s at the White House, and he catches up with other officials there on the fly.",
      "Rubio, who has privately expressed the importance of regular face time with Trump, also has become a regular at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 the estate in Florida where Trump stays most weekends \u2014 spending time there about every other week, according to a person close to Rubio.",
      "\u201cThe way that the president works is he solicits opinions from a whole lot of folks,\u201d this person said. \u201cBeing present, being at the table or in the Oval or the dinner table at Mar-a-Lago, is how these decisions are made.\u201d",
      "The presidential face time is designed to avoid scenarios like one in mid-February, when Rubio was in Europe holding meetings with his counterparts and wasn\u2019t aware that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would deliver a speech so bluntly taking the idea of Ukraine\u2019s joining NATO off the table. Hegseth\u2019s comments sent shock waves across Europe and were seen as the Trump administration\u2019s ceding leverage in negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine before they had even begun.",
      "A couple of days later, Rubio was again unexpectedly fielding outrage from officials in Europe after\u00a0Vice President JD Vance delivered a speech in Munich sharply criticizing the continent.",
      "People close to him said that while he was frustrated, he didn\u2019t disagree with the sentiments Vance and Hegseth delivered.",
      "Asked about Vance\u2019s speech, the senior administration official said, \u201cI think that what the vice president said in Munich is very strongly held beliefs of everybody in the administration.\u201d",
      "On the Hegseth speech, the official wouldn\u2019t get into specifics of Rubio\u2019s conversations but said Ukraine\u2019s not joining NATO was \u201ckind of an obvious reality.\u201d",
      "A State Department spokesperson took issue with the characterizations that Rubio was caught off guard.",
      "\u201cMore fake news from people trying to derail President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d the official said. \u201cSecretary Rubio will never apologize or hesitate to put America and Americans first.\u201d",
      "Winning over MAGA",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s core supporters know Rubio by the disparaging nickname Trump gave him in the 2016 campaign: \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d They\u2019ve viewed him as the kind of mainstream Republican who might seek to reshape rather than execute on Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda.",
      "Since he was nominated to be secretary of state, Rubio has tried to ingratiate himself with Trump\u2019s MAGA base and ease any suspicions about his loyalty.",
      "This week, Raheem Kassam, a Trump loyalist and close associate of former top White House strategist Steve Bannon, posted a photo on X of Rubio at a new MAGA haunt on Capitol Hill, the restaurant Butterworth\u2019s.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019d have told me even a year ago that I\u2019d be running the best spot on Capitol Hill and that Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, would be a repeat guest, I\u2019d have enquired as to the strength of marijuana you were smoking,\u201d Kassam, an investor in Butterworth\u2019s, wrote.",
      "Rubio also made a point during the inauguration to attend a ball hosted by the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA, and in early April, he appeared on \u201cTriggered,\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s podcast.",
      "Since he became Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Rubio has shifted his positions to the right on some key policies \u2014 from the war in Ukraine to U.S. aid overseas to immigration.",
      "Those close to Rubio said any so-called transformation wasn\u2019t an overnight phenomenon that took place once he was chosen to be secretary of state.",
      "The senior administration official said that coming out of the 2016 election, Rubio sought to figure out, from a policy standpoint, how to connect the Republican agenda with the real experiences of people around the country.",
      "\u201cAlmost everything that this administration stands for are positions that he has advocated for as part of that process,\u201d the official said, pointing to his hard-line approach to China. \u201cHe\u2019s every bit as natural a fit in the MAGA coalition as anybody.\u201d",
      "The person close to Rubio said he doesn\u2019t believe he needs to prove his MAGA bona fides.",
      "\u201cPeople forget he was a tea party insurgent,\u201d this person said, adding: \u201cCore to his DNA is the insurgent grassroots. That\u2019s how he came of age in national politics.\u201d",
      "\u2018We know who to blame\u2019",
      "Questions about the span of Rubio\u2019s portfolio and his influence with Trump have hung over him since he became secretary of state, not least because Trump put multiple envoys in charge of the most pressing foreign policy challenges.",
      "Steve Witkoff, a longtime Trump friend and fellow New York business mogul, is the key player in charge of his efforts to end the war in Ukraine, reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and hold diplomatic talks with Iran over its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cI think it is clear, and certainly appears publicly, that Witkoff is basically the secretary of state at this point,\u201d said a Rubio ally who speaks with him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tough spot to be in.\u201d",
      "A Republican senator also questioned where Rubio fits in on Ukraine talks. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly there, but Steve Witkoff is running it big picture, particularly with the Russians,\u201d the senator said.",
      "The senior administration official said Rubio is heavily involved in all those matters, even if he\u2019s not publicly described as in charge of the issue.",
      "\u201cHe has an amazing relationship with Steve,\u201d the official said.",
      "Trump has picked others for leading roles on issues that would typically fall under the secretary of state\u2019s portfolio.",
      "Trump ally Ric Grenell has been tasked with handling North Korea, which Trump\u2019s secretary of state in his first term, Mike Pompeo, visited as part of his key role in the two countries\u2019 leaders\u2019 historic meetings. Grenell also led an effort to secure the release of wrongfully detained Americans in Venezuela.",
      "Vance also has been put in charge of some significant geopolitical challenges, including overseeing negotiations over the future ownership of TikTok. And so far, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has played a key role in the administration\u2019s approach to China, which has focused heavily on tariffs.",
      "Such big-ticket foreign policy issues were top issues for Rubio\u2019s recent predecessors in both parties.",
      "The Western Hemisphere, including immigration, is one area where Rubio has a clear foothold.",
      "During his first overseas travel as secretary to Latin America, he negotiated immigration agreements with Panama, Guatemala and El Salvador. He has also publicly led the charge on revoking the visas of international students who the administration has said are threats to U.S. national security.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something he\u2019s felt very strongly about for a number of years,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cThe secretary of health and human services can\u2019t revoke visas, and so, to the extent this is a priority of the president\u2019s, it\u2019s natural that the State Department would do our consular affairs duty that we do.\u201d",
      "Another of Rubio\u2019s assignments from Trump has been to secure the return of the Panama Canal to the United States. Trump called Rubio out during a joint address to Congress in March to wish him luck in his endeavor.",
      "\u201cNow we know who to blame if anything goes wrong,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Some of Rubio\u2019s saw Trump\u2019s calling him out at the joint address as devastating, because it\u2019s something Trump is known to do in private to put aides on notice, a former Trump official said. The person close to Rubio viewed it differently, saying, \u201cIt was like how you would rip your best buddy if you had a global platform to do so.\u201d"

      "TikTok\u00a0was fined 530 million euros ($600 million) by its lead E.U. privacy regulator on Friday over concerns on how it protects user information and was ordered to suspend data transfers to China if its processing is not brought into compliance within six months.",
      "Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) said\u00a0TikTok, owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, failed to show that E.U. users\u2019 personal data, some of which is remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded the high level of protection provided for under E.U. law.",
      "As a result, the short-video platform did not address potential access by Chinese authorities to the data under counter-espionage and other laws identified by\u00a0TikTok\u00a0as materially diverging from E.U. standards, the DPC said in a statement.",
      "TikTok\u00a0said it strongly contested the finding and that it has used the E.U.\u2019s own legal framework, specifically so-called standard contractual clauses, to grant tightly controlled and limited remote access. It plans to appeal the ruling.",
      "It also said the decision fails to fully consider data security measures first rolled out in 2023 that independently monitor remote access and ensure E.U. user data is stored in dedicated data centers in Europe and the United States.",
      "TikTok, which has grown rapidly among teenagers around the world in recent years and has 175 million users across Europe, added that it has never received a request for E.U. user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided data to them.",
      "\u201cThis ruling risks setting a precedent with far-reaching consequences for companies and entire industries across Europe that operate on a global scale,\u201d\u00a0TikTok\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "The DPC also found that while\u00a0TikTok\u00a0said throughout the four-year inquiry that it did not store E.U. user data on servers in China, it disclosed last month that it discovered in February that a limited amount was stored in China and since deleted.",
      "\u201cThe DPC is taking these recent developments very seriously. We are considering what further regulatory action may be warranted,\u201d DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said.",
      "It is the second time\u00a0TikTok\u00a0has been reprimanded by the DPC. It was fined\u00a0345 million euros\u00a0in 2023 for breaching privacy laws regarding the processing of children\u2019s personal data in the E.U.",
      "The powerful Irish privacy regulator, the lead regulator in the E.U. for many of the world\u2019s top tech firms due to the location of their regional headquarters in Ireland, has also fined the likes of Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0LinkedIn,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Meta since it was given sanctioning powers in 2018.",
      "Under the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that also covers European Economic Area member states Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the lead regulator for any given company can impose fines of up to 4% of its global revenue."

      "President Donald Trump released a budget proposal Friday calling for a mix of cuts to domestic programs involving public health, education and clean energy, while seeking to increase spending on his priorities like border security and a bigger military.",
      "The 40-page request was addressed to congressional leaders and accompanied by a letter from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought addressed to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "Overall, Vought said the proposal contains a 23% cut ($163 billion) in discretionary funding, and a 13% increase in military spending.",
      "The White House budget comes as the Republican-led Congress is seeking to craft a massive bill for Trump\u2019s priorities of tax cuts, higher spending on immigration enforcement and the military, spending cuts in other parts of the federal government, and a debt limit increase. Vought mentions the calls for border funding in the new budget blueprint.",
      "White House budgets are usually symbolic and never become law as written. But they represent the president\u2019s vision for spending and tend to influence the debate on Capitol Hill. They also tend to be a vehicle for messaging on the White House\u2019s most popular priorities \u2014 and often propose difficult policy compromises or cuts that become the basis for political attacks from the opposition party.",
      "Trump\u2019s new proposals could affect the next round of government funding talks, with funding set to expire on Sept. 30 after passage of a six-month funding bill in early March. That legislation \u2014 unlike the party-line \"reconciliation\" bill \u2014 is subject to the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate, meaning it will need significant Democratic support to become law in the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Trump's budget proposes a variety of steep cuts to well-known government programs, including cutting the National Institutes of Health by $18 billion compared to 2025 levels, the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP) by $4 billion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by $3.6 billion.",
      "The budget also calls for various cuts to clean energy funding, education funding, scientific research and international aid.",
      "And it proposes a funding boost for Trump priorities, including a $43.8 billion boost to the Department of Homeland Security, a $113.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $500 million for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"MAHA\" \u2014 \"make America healthy again\" \u2014 priorities like promoting nutrition and exercise.",
      "The Trump proposal is limited to \"discretionary\" spending and excludes proposals on \"mandatory\" spending, the major part of the U.S. budget that covers safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet that's where difficult decisions on federal spending ultimately lie, with Medicaid proving to be a sticking point among Republicans as they consider their big bill on Trump's tax and spending priorities later this year.",
      "Trump's budget won praise from Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called it \"a bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American\u00a0strength\u00a0and\u00a0prosperity.\u201d",
      "\u201cHouse Republicans stand ready to work alongside\u00a0President\u00a0Trump to implement a responsible budget that puts America first,\" he said.",
      "It was slammed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who vowed that Democrats will \"fight this heartless budget with everything we\u2019ve got.\"",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s days of pretending to be a populist are over. His policies are nothing short of an all out assault on hardworking Americans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"As he guts healthcare, slashes education, and hollows out programs families rely on \u2014 he\u2019s bankrolling tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. It\u2019s not just fiscally irresponsible, it\u2019s a betrayal of working people from a morally bankrupt president.\""

      "Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi\u2019s Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: \u201cShe wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.\u201d",
      "Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot.",

      "Schlatter was holding auditions for \u201cLaugh-In\u201d when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead.",
      "\u201cI think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,\u201d he wrote in his 2023 memoir \u201cStill Laughing A Life in Comedy.\u201d \u201cI must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\u201d",
      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \u201cLaugh-In\u201d co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",
      "Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school.",
      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors\u2019 Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse\u2019s College of Theatre Arts.",
      "Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast.",
      "She got her national television break on \u201cThe Garry Moore Show\u201d in 1964, just after\u00a0Carol Burnett\u00a0was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician\u2019s assistant to Dom DeLuise\u2019s character Dominic the Great.",

    "summary": "Laws that target packaging materials make the new paper-fiber product an eco-friendly solution for shipping refrigerated products.",
    "story": [
      "As lawmakers take aim at hard-to-recycle plastic and foam, a California packaging company is introducing a new shipping cooler made of woven paper fibers that could transform how temperature-sensitive products like pharmaceuticals and laboratory reagents are moved across the world.",
      "The introduction of the new \u201cRecyCoolers\u201d containers, which are made of recyclable paper and fiber, offers a sign that so-called \u201cextended producer responsibility\u201d laws are propelling a shift toward more sustainable products in the U.S.",
      "At least 33 states have adopted EPR laws, which seek to reduce the use of plastic, Styrofoam and other materials that cause pollution by making companies responsible for their products\u2019 end of life, and shifting the cost of disposal to producers.",
      "More than 80 million tons of packaging trash is discarded in the United States a year, with only half of it recycled, and only 9% of plastic packaging recycled, according to the Product Stewardship Institute, an environmental policy expert and consulting organization.",
      "EPR laws are designed to reduce landfill waste, increase recycling rates and curb the environmental damage caused by nonrecyclable materials. As a result, businesses face stricter packaging regulations that continue to evolve.",
      "As of last month, seven states have adopted EPR legislation that specifically targets packaging materials: California, Washington, New Jersey, Minnesota, Colorado, Oregon and Maine.",
      "\u201cAs the world gets hotter, it makes sense that there is a call for safe shipping options,\u201d said Katherine Tellock, CEO of the nonprofit Chicago Environmentalists. \u201cIt would be great if they would switch to completely recyclable items because that ultimately is something that can be continually washed out and reused, and is almost always less environmentally impactful.\u201d",
      "Last month, Container Consulting Service in Gilroy, California, unveiled the\u00a0RecyCoolers, which are made of recyclable paper and fiber. The containers have been third-party validated to meet ISTA Thermal and ISTA Transit standards, which are qualifications insulated shipping containers must meet to deliver pharmaceutical products.",
      "Other companies also make similar environmentally friendly shipping coolers. But CCS says its products use a unique technology that can keep their contents cold so long that they match plastic products in performance. Its patented design uses open-cell woven or nonwoven paper fibers from 1.5 to 3 inches thick between two interconnected fiber walls, so the resulting insulation can resist heat to a degree that matches expanded polyethylene.",
      "The RecyCoolers can keep their contents frozen or refrigerated for more than 100 hours, CCS says, long enough to be used in long-haul and international shipments. And once they arrive at their destination, the curbside-recyclable, fully paper-fiber shipping containers can be transformed into other paper products.",
      "That makes the RecyCoolers a good alternative to polystyrene, according to Tellock, of Chicago Environmentalists. A few months ago, she had medicine shipped to her that had to be kept cold, but it came in Styrofoam.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want that, that wasn\u2019t good,\u201d Tellock said. \u201cIf they could have used something that\u2019s recyclable instead, that would be great.\u201d",
      "The impact of reusable shipping coolers could be significant, research shows. Materials like polystyrene and polyethylene, which are in most coolers, pose distinct threats to humans and animals because they are not biodegradable. Styrene carcinogens are released during production and use; the environment is polluted because the materials are lightweight and tend to fragment, and wildlife ingests the microplastic particles. Plastic foam made with those components can last thousands of years, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "\u201cPolystyrene foam is particularly bad,\u201d said Janet Domenitz, executive director of Massachusetts Student Public Interest Research Group, a student-advocacy organization that focuses on protecting the environment and public health. \u201cIt is far more lightweight than most other types of plastic, making it all too easy for a gust of wind to blow it out of trash cans or landfills and into the environment.\u201d",
      "Defenders of polystyrene argue that the material is more economical and uses less energy and water than comparable paper or fiber-based alternatives, due to foam's lower weight. The Plastic Industry Organization declined a request for comment.",
      "But many U.S. lawmakers are considering bans on polystyrene products. In March, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, introduced the Farewell to Foam Act, a proposal to eliminate the sale and distribution of polystyrene products starting in 2028. In 2022, California passed a law requiring plastic and packaging companies to reduce single-use plastics, but it has yet to be implemented and faces an uncertain future.",
      "The movement to drop plastic foam packaging is also spreading around the world: Dozens of countries, including Canada, Germany and Zimbabwe, have banned or restricted the use of Styrofoam, particularly in packaging and food service.",
      "RecyCoolers were designed to work in concert with those emerging laws, according to Julie Yetter Simpson, co-owner of CCS.",
      "\u201cThe versatility of the product plays a key role in supporting our commitment to environmental responsibility,\u201d she said.",
      "Yaniv Abitan, managing director at the international cold-packaging distribution company Insulpack Group, says his company has tested RecyCoolers and that they answer \u201ca major environmental call to action as the industry transitions away from single-use plastics and EPS foam.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe recognize the urgent need for eco-friendly alternatives that don\u2019t compromise performance,\u201d Abitan said. \u201cRecyCoolers is a signal where the industry is headed for domestic and international cold-chain shipping.\u201d"

      "Tyler Bossetti, 31, was charged in U.S. District Court in Columbus with wire fraud and aiding the filing of a false or fraudulent document. In a court document, federal prosecutors allege that Bossetti knowingly participated in the four-year scheme in Ohio and elsewhere \"to defraud and to deprive another of money and property by materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.",
      "Court records show that Bossetti entered a plea on April 22, though the details have been sealed. His attorney declined to comment, and Bossetti is scheduled to be arraigned on July 13.",
      "According to a court document, Bossetti allegedly sought short-term real estate investments from 2019 to 2023 that he intended to buy, renovate, sell, or rent, using social media and \u201cthird-party companies\u201d to find investors.",
      "Bossetti would then promise investors high returns, usually 30% or more, and falsely claim that the investments were risk-free and secured by real estate he owned, prosecutors allege.",
      "\"When making solicitations and executing promissory notes, Bossetti knew that he would not use the investment funds for the purported business and that profits from the purported business could not cover the obligations he was taking on in the promissory notes,\" prosecutors said in the court document.",
      "The finance influencer allegedly spent money he received from investors on cryptocurrency investments and personal expenses, including, \"luxury housing and vehicles,\" the court document states. He also paid investors with investment funds he received from newer investors instead of business income.",
      "The court document states that Bossetti allegedly received over $20 million from investors, but the investors, who were not identified, lost over $11 million due to the scheme.",
      "He's also accused of helping someone file a false 1099-INT form to the Internal Revenue Service, in which it was claimed that the person earned $4,500 in interest income when they never did. Prosecutors allege this was done to conceal the scheme.",
      "Bossetti positions himself as a financial consultant online\u00a0and hosts a podcast called \u201cAll For Nothing,\u201d which has 124,000 followers on Instagram. In clips from his podcast posted to social media, Bossetti and his guests provided his audience with financial advice and discussed other topics, including football and reality TV.",

      "By December 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, with her attorneys stating that, in multiple incidents, Baldoni harassed Lively on set and crossed boundaries during intimate scenes,\u00a0according to an administrative complaint\u00a0filed Dec. 20, 2024 and obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni denied the accusations at the time.",

      "Also on Dec. 31, Lively filed a\u00a0lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d in which her legal team argued she had been a victim of\u00a0sexual harassment and a smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "In response, in January 2025, Baldoni sued Lively, accusing her, her husband Ryan Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm of\u00a0defamation\u00a0and\u00a0other contractual claims.",
      "In a statement to NBC News in Jan. 16, 2025, Lively\u2019s legal team said the lawsuit was \u201canother chapter in the abuser playbook,\u201d denying the allegations.",

      "By February, the judge overseeing their trial didn\u2019t restrict what their attorneys could say publicly but he did issue a warning about public comments, according to NBC News.\u00a0Later that month, Lively amended her original complaint, alleging that other women had complained about Baldoni\u2019s misconduct, as well as added a new claim for defamation.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News about Lively\u2019s amended complaint at the time."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said Friday that he will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, the latest move in the escalating clash between the administration and the Ivy League school.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Friday that he will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, the latest move in the escalating clash between the administration and the Ivy League school.",
      "\"We are going to be taking away Harvard\u2019s Tax Exempt Status. It\u2019s what they deserve!\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",
      "The president had previously suggested the university should lose its tax-exempt status. His latest statement came after Harvard sued the administration over its decision to freeze more than $2 billion in funding to the Ivy League school. The administration claimed the university was refusing to follow the administration's demands that it take actions aimed at ending antisemitism on campus.",
      "\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \u2018Sickness?\u2019\u201d Trump threatened in a Truth Social post last month. He added, \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"",
      "Responding to Trump's announcement Friday, Harvard spokesperson Jason Newton said that the government has \"long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission\" and that there was no legal basis to rescind its status.",
      "\"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth,\" he said.",
      "Newton added that revoking the university's tax-exempt status \"would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission.\"",
      "\"It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation,\" he continued. \"The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Harvard accused the Trump administration of violating the First Amendment and other laws and regulations after it paused $2.2 billion in grants. The school called on a federal judge to declare the move unconstitutional and order the government to reinstate the funding.",
      "The federal government froze funding to Harvard after the school said it wouldn't comply with \"critical reforms\" called for by the Trump administration. Some of those changes included a demand for the discontinuation of diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as reforms to programs \"with egregious records of antisemitism or other bias.\"",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber told NBC News' Lester Holt last week that the research funded by the federal grants is unrelated to antisemitism, which the school said in its lawsuit it has taken steps to address on its campus since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cPutting that research at jeopardy because of claims of antisemitism seems to us to be misguided,\u201d Garber said. \u201cThe effort to address antisemitism will not be advanced by shutting off funding.\u201d",
      "Tax-exempt nonprofit groups, known as 501(c)(3) organizations, are prohibited from participating in certain political activities, according to the Internal Revenue Service. \"Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes,\" the agency's website says.",
      "Soon after Trump's Truth Social post, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and a group of other Senate Democrats sent a letter to the acting Treasury inspector general for tax administration requesting an investigation into the president's targeting of Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "\"It is both illegal and unconstitutional for the IRS to take direction from the President to target schools, hospitals, churches, or any other tax-exempt entities as retribution for using their free speech rights,\" they wrote the official, Heather Hill.",
      "They added, \"We request that you review whether the President or his allies have taken any step to direct or pressure the IRS to take politically-motivated actions regarding the tax exempt status of the President\u2019s political targets.\""

      "But while DOGE projects helped Musk gain enormous power and influence, his reputation has taken a beating in the process. His outsize role in the Trump administration and his efforts to downsize the federal workforce have made him the target of protests around the country. And his electric car company, Tesla, reported a steep drop in profits last month.",
      "But Saturday\u2019s vote is expected to be a sure victory for the controversial billionaire. For one, most of the 283 eligible voters \u2014 residents of Cameron County whose homes would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city \u2014 are SpaceX employees or have some connection to the company."

      "In a letter to President Donald Trump, 13 senators led by Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote that Starlink seemed to make sudden breakthroughs this year in at least five countries that previously resisted giving the company footholds there. The senators called for Trump to investigate and make the findings public.",
      "\u201cIt is disturbing that the Senate ... has to consider the possibility of self-dealing by senior officials,\u201d they wrote in the letter.",
      "\u201cMusk is reportedly taking advantage of his government role to coerce concessions from foreign governments for his own benefit, including unfettered market access as well as contracts with his companies, in exchange for favorable treatment by the U.S. government,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has said Musk follows all applicable ethics rules related to his dual role as a presidential adviser and corporate executive.",
      "SpaceX and Musk also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Starlink is a subsidiary of SpaceX, where Musk is CEO. In a highly unusual move, Musk kept his CEO roles at SpaceX and Tesla while he has been an adviser to Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency since January.",
      "During five weeks beginning in March, Starlink reached agreements with governments and telecommunications companies to operate in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Lesotho, according to statements by government officials and companies in those countries.",
      "The Democratic senators wrote that they\u2019re concerned Musk exploited his government position to seal those deals. They noted Musk\u2019s sprawling business interests and his meetings, while in government, with the leaders of some of the countries where Starlink has made new agreements.",
      "In February, Musk spoke with Bangladeshi officials via teleconference, and according to Bangladesh\u2019s interim head of government, Muhammad Yunus, Starlink was a topic of discussion. The same month, Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Blair House, a government guest house near the White House. It\u2019s not clear whether the two men discussed Starlink during the meeting.",
      "Two Indian companies, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, announced deals March 11 to bring Starlink to India. Bangladesh announced a deal a few weeks later.",
      "The senators also cited news reports, including one this week in The Washington Post, which cited several anonymous sources, outlining how some foreign leaders interpreted the Starlink deals as one way to win special treatment from the Trump administration in tariff negotiations. Yunus mentioned Starlink in a letter to Trump last month outlining steps that he said Bangladesh took to build goodwill for a tariff deal.",
      "And in February, citing anonymous sources, Reuters reported that Vietnam\u2019s plans to let Starlink into the country were motivated by a desire to reach a tariff deal. Vietnam\u2019s government said March 26 that it would allow SpaceX to operate there on a trial basis.",
      "\u201cPublic servants must serve Americans, not their own bank accounts,\u201d the letter says.",
      "\u201cThese alleged actions are an egregious breach of public trust, degrade our credibility with allies and partners, and potentially violate U.S. laws,\u201d it says.",
      "Though no Republicans signed the letter, some of the Senate\u2019s highest-ranking Democrats did. Warner is the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Others signing the letter include Patty Murray, D-Wash., vice chair of the Appropriations Committee; Jack Reed, D-R.I., ranking member of the Armed Services Committee; and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Budget Committee.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry has lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly-funded security detail at Britain\u2019s High Court.",
      "King Charles III\u2019s second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is currently the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the royal family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s company, News Group Newspapers, agreed to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to Harry after settling a long-running legal battle. NGN admitted that between 1996 and 2011, staff on The Sun newspapers used unlawful methods to dig up private information about Harry and his late mother, Princess Diana.The duke is also among a group of celebrities suing another publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which prints the Daily Mail, accusing it of lawbreaking in its attempts to gather information on them. The trial is due to start next year.",
      "In 2023, he dropped a libel case against ANL for its coverage of his legal battle over personal security. And the same year, he was awarded 140,600 pounds ($179,350) after successfully bringing a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers.",
      "Alongside these courtroom battles, Harry has endured a turbulent relationship with his own family since leaving the United Kingdom, including with his father, King Charles III who has been diagnosed with cancer."

      "In the filing, Agnifilio argued the evidence seized at the time of his arrest should be suppressed because law enforcement conducted a warrantless search of Mangione\u2019s backpack after he was handcuffed and \u201csurrounded by ten police officers\u201d in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.",
      "Finally,\u00a0Agnifilo moved to dismiss the state indictment\u2019s terrorism-related counts, arguing that \"the grand jury evidence failed to establish the required element that Mr. Mangione intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination, or kidnapping.\"",
      "The various cases linked to Thompson's killing have \"led to a legal tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors as they fight for who controls the fate of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione,\" the filing said",
      "In Pennsylvania, Mangione is accused of gun possession and forgery. His lawyers accuse New York prosecutors of\u00a0\"trying to get two bites at the apple to convict Mr. Mangione\" and say that police have \"methodically and purposefully trampled his constitutional rights.\"",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's office told The Associated Press it would respond to Agnifilo's arguments in a court filing.",
      "Mangione is due back in court on June 26 for a hearing in the state case against him, while the federal case is set to be tried on Dec.5, a full year after Thompson's killing.",
      "This week, New York federal prosecutors submitted a letter responding to a defense attorney's claim that they had \"eavesdropped\" on a jailhouse phone conversation between Mangione and a lawyer.",
      "\"To be sure, no one at DANY (New York County District Attorney's Office) or the Government 'eavesdropped' on the defendant on a live basis,\" the letter said, adding that New York prosecutors instead heard a recorded version of the call, which is standard practice."

      "Marco Rubio\u2019s reaches new heights in the Trump administration. The latest jobs report is expected to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Plus, a look ahead at the biggest storylines of the Kentucky Derby.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "Marco Rubio\u2019s swift rise to a central spot in Trump\u2019s orbit",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s position in the Trump administration expanded again yesterday when the president announced he would take on the role of interim national security adviser. Rubio\u2019s predecessor, Mike Waltz, will be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Trump said.",
      "Waltz, a former Florida congressman, has been on shaky ground since he inadvertently added a journalist to a private Signal chat with other top national security officials to discuss military strikes in Yemen. Trump had initially nominated Rep. Elise Stefanik for the high-profile U.N. ambassador post but withdrew her nomination a few weeks ago, citing Republicans\u2019 thin House majority.",
      "This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",
      "For Rubio, the new role adds to his list of responsibilities. He\u2019s also the acting administrator for the diminished U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as acting archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration. Also noteworthy: No one has been secretary of state and national security adviser simultaneously since Henry Kissinger 50 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s a remarkable shift in fortunes for Rubio, who sparred sharply with Trump in the past and who risked being overshadowed early on in his second White House term.",
      "Remember a few months ago, when Rubio took his first trip as secretary of state to Latin America? Then, he was caught off guard by drastic changes to foreign aid and Trump\u2019s public backing for turning the Gaza Strip into a Middle East Riviera. Over the next 10 days, he was also blindsided by foreign policy pronouncements from top administration officials.",
      "But things have changed since then as Rubio figured out a strategy to minimize such frustrations, adapting some of his foreign policy positions while endearing himself to Trump and his allies. He\u2019s eating at noteworthy restaurants, attending high-profile events and making it a point to spend more time at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, according to more than a dozen senior current and foreign administration officials, congressional officials and others who are close to Rubio or the White House.",

Reporter\u00a0Jon Schuppe, who has covered the Mississippi Capitol Police extensively in recent years, shared his experience putting together this story:",
      "\u201cThis is a story I never expected to write. In early 2023, while investigating a string of shootings by the Mississippi Capitol Police, I wrote to Sinatra Jordan, who was in jail on charges alleging he shot at police officers during a chase through downtown Jackson that ended with his friend shot in the head. He told me in a letter and in phone calls that he never had a gun. But it was his word against the officers\u2019. I wrote a story about the case and moved on.",
      "\u201cJordan kept calling me, though. Months, then years, passed, and he remained in jail without any progress in his case, or any clue when he might get a day in court. I began to see his ordeal as an emblem of our deeply flawed criminal justice system. Despite the constitutional right to a speedy trial, people all over Mississippi, and in other parts of the country, spend years in jail without being deemed innocent or guilty. Two years after we first spoke, I decided to return to Jordan\u2019s story.",
      "\u201cAround that time, the case took an extraordinary turn. A grand jury indicted the two officers, charging them with aggravated assault for allegedly shooting Jordan\u2019s friend and firing at Jordan. That led prosecutors to drop the shooting charges against Jordan, who pleaded guilty to another offense and was released after 940 days behind bars. When he finally walked out of jail, I was there to greet him. And with his help I obtained copies of evidence which showed investigators never found proof that he shot at the officers. Now the officers \u2014 who were released on bail \u2014 are waiting for a trial.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday to end public funding of National Public Radio and PBS to stop what he called \"biased and partisan news coverage.\"",
      "The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to \"cease federal funding for NPR and PBS\" to the extent allowed by law. The order could be challenged in court.",
      "The White House said in a Friday statement that both organizations had received\u00a0\"tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds each year to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "\"Unlike in 1967, when the CPB was established, today the media landscape is filled with abundant, diverse, and innovative news options,\" the executive order reads. \"Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.\"",
      "Trump and his loyalists, including Elon Musk, have long complained that NPR and PBS are biased and promote left-wing causes, an allegation staunchly denied by executives at both organizations. Last month, Trump called for their defunding on Truth Social, calling them \"RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS' THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!\"",
      "To date, NPR and PBS receive roughly\u00a0half a billion dollars\u00a0each in public money and earn money from sponsorship. NPR says less than 1% of its funding comes from public sources.",

      "Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, issued a defiant Friday statement and stressed that the White House did not control the organization.",
      "\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President\u2019s authority. Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,\" she said.",

      "Riley added that more than 160 local TV stations across the country, particularly those in rural areas, offer a \"lifeline in hundreds of communities where there is no other source of local media.\"",
      "In a statement last month, in response to a draft memo to Congress outlining the funding cut, an NPR spokesperson said: \"Eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would have a devastating impact on American communities across the nation that rely on public radio for trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts, and public safety information.\"",
      "Kerger said last month that an order to defund the organization would \"disrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\" she added.",
      "Three members of the CPB board were removed from their posts via email earlier this week, leaving two remaining. The three who were removed filed a lawsuit, but their attorneys could not articulate in court any immediate irreparable harm facing CPB or the individuals.",
      "Because of that, the judge only ordered the Trump administration to provide 48 hours' notice before replacing board members with acting or interim members. Board members must be selected by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report Wednesday that Trump's executive orders in his first 100 days in office had created a \"chilling effect and have the potential to curtail media freedoms,\" including by restricting access to the regular pool of reporters who follow the president and reopening FCC investigations into networks, including NBC News.",

      "\u201c\u2018The Intruder\u2019\u00a0is about a woman trapped in her remote cabin by a terrible storm, and she invites in a pre-teen girl who she finds squatting in her tool shed.\u00a0But as the night goes on, she discovers that the girl might be even more dangerous than the storm raging outside,\u201d McFadden tells TODAY.com in an interview over email.",
      "While she\u2019s a bestselling author many times over, writing is actually McFadden\u2019s side hustle. By day, she\u2019s a doctor specializing in brain injuries. In fact, Freida McFadden is her pen name.",

      "It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the rest of my life.",
      "There\u2019s not much I can do much about my shattered life, but the roof issue is more surmountable. I have been calling my landlord, Rudy, for the last month to try and fix it. Every day, I find a few new shingles on the ground next to the cabin, and one day, I\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ll sit on my living room sofa and look straight up to see the moon.",
      "And then a few days ago, my calls became more urgent. There\u2019s a storm coming, and if this roof doesn\u2019t get fixed ASAP, I could die. So I told Rudy he needed to get his butt over here \u2014 now. I wasn\u2019t nice, but I said what I had to say.",
      "Now, a dozen messages later, Rudy is finally here in the flesh.",
      "As we stand together just outside the cabin, Rudy squints up at my roof with his droopy blue eyes. He\u2019s a scrawny man in his late 50s who looks like he only eats one or two nonliquid meals per day. He scratches the gray stubble on his chin and adjusts the worn gray baseball cap he always wears. As usual, he reeks of cigarette smoke. The stench of it was overpowering when I first moved into the cabin, and it took me a week to get it aired out. It still clings to some of the furniture months later.",
      "\u201cLooks OK to me, Casey,\u201d he says.",

      "At least this is just a rainstorm. Once it snows in a month or so? Forget it. I\u2019m going to wake up one morning in a snowdrift.",

      "You need to learn to relax a little. That was my goal when I moved out to this cabin in The Middle of Nowhere, New Hampshire. I wanted peace and quiet, which is exactly what I got. Even with all the chirping birds and crickets and woodpeckers, it\u2019s so quiet that I\u2019ve got no distractions from thinking about the complete mess I made of my life.",
      "I came out here after I lost my teaching job. I had this idea about living off the grid for a little while, but then I discovered what living \u201coff the grid\u201d actually meant. As much as I enjoy roughing it a bit, I very much did not want to build my own septic system. So here I am, not living off the grid \u2014 I have electricity, running hot and cold water, and a working landline telephone \u2014 but I do not have a television, and I look back with disdain on the days when my smartphone was glued to my right hand. I sold the phone before I came out here.",
      "Living off the grid is great. As long as you can still use the toilet. Oh, and you definitely need a roof.",

      "He doesn\u2019t give me a specific day or time, which is par for the course. Undoubtedly, he\u2019ll call me with an hour\u2019s notice, and if I happen to be out, then my roof just won\u2019t get fixed that day. I\u2019ll have to annoy him as much as I can to make sure this gets done.",

      "I shoot him a look. On a scale of one to 10, Rudy gets a two on the landlord scale. Not only does he never answer my messages, but he refuses to believe there\u2019s a problem with anything. When the refrigerator randomly stopped working a few months ago, his response was, Well, it was working when you moved in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried about that tree,\u201d I tell him.",
      "Rudy cocks his head in the direction I\u2019m pointing, at the tree on the edge of my property. I don\u2019t know what kind of tree it is, but the trunk is wider than three of me, and it towers over the cabin.",
      "\u201cAnd why are you worried about the tree?\u201d he asks me in a patronizing voice.",
      "I stomp over to the culprit in my waterproof boots and press my palm against its bark. In response to the pressure, the tree groans threateningly and shifts over about two inches.",

      "\u201cSo trees aren\u2019t supposed to move like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes they do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, Rudy. They are inanimate.\u201d",
      "He takes a long drag from his cigarette, then blows out a giant cloud of smoke. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call a landscaper. Happy?\u201d",
      "No. I\u2019ll be happy when the tree is gone. I\u2019ve been worried about it for the last month, and now that a storm is coming, I\u2019m really worried.",
      "I look up at the roof of my house. It will probably hold. And the tree probably won\u2019t fall down. I probably won\u2019t die tonight.",
      "And if I do, the good news is that nobody will miss me."

      "The 2025 Met Gala will be an extravagant event \u2014\u00a0as it always is. Stars will come dressed to the nines (and 10s) on fashion's biggest night.",
      "The theme for this year is \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d which celebrates the concept of Black dandyism.",
      "In a press release, the Met said the theme was inspired by Barnard College chair and professor Monica L. Miller\u2019s 2009 book called \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d",
      "The museum also said the dress code, \u201cTailored For You,\u201d is \u201ca nod to the exhibition\u2019s focus on suiting and menswear.\u201d",
      "According to Vogue, this will be the first time since 2003 that the gala will feature predominantly menswear at the gala.",
      "When is the 2025 Met Gala?",

      "The Costume Institute\u2019s first fundraiser was held in 1948 in the fall. Until 2001, the Met Gala was held in November or December.",
      "From 2002 to 2004, the party was in April. Then came 2005. The \"Celebrating\u00a0Chanel\"-themed event was first time the Met Gala was held the first Monday of May.",
      "Since then, it's been a tradition, enough so that a documentary about the Met Gala was entitled \"The First Monday in May.\" This means next year's Met Gala will be on May 4, May 3 in 2027 and May 1 in 2028.",
      "Though the Met Gala is not always in May. In 2021, the celebration was moved to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "Host Seth Meyers first mentioned to Lively that he was \"not totally informed\" about the details of what she said was an \"intense\" year.",
      "\"I'm thrilled you're not doing 'Weekend Update' right now, because you'd be totally informed,\" Lively joked.",

      "\"What I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It's what keeps us silent. I acknowledge that many people don't have the opportunity to speak. I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It's the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls.

      "In response, in January 2025, Baldoni sued Lively, accusing her, her husband Ryan Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm of\u00a0defamation\u00a0and\u00a0other contractual claims.",
      "In a statement to NBC News in Jan. 16, 2025, Lively\u2019s legal team said the lawsuit was \u201canother chapter in the abuser playbook,\u201d denying the allegations.",

      "By February, the judge overseeing their trial didn't restrict what their attorneys could say publicly but he did issue a warning about public comments, according to NBC News. Later that month, Lively amended her original complaint, alleging that other women had complained about Baldoni's misconduct, as well as added a new claim for defamation.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 06:33:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is at the center of a national election in Australia, where support for conservatives has dropped among voters angered by U.S. policies.",
    "story": [
      "Days after a Canadian election that hinged on who would best stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump, he is at the center of an election in another liberal democracy.",
      "Trust in the United States is plummeting in Australia, which votes Saturday amid global financial turmoil sparked by tariffs Trump has imposed on trading partners around the world including Australia, a U.S. ally and vital security partner in countering China.",
      "As in Canada, Australia\u2019s opposition conservative party, the Liberal Party, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump.",
      "On Thursday, two polls showed the Liberals trailing the center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "His opponent, Peter Dutton, has pushed the Liberals further to the right since becoming party leader in 2022.",
      "His nods to Trump include pledging to slash 41,000 public service jobs, proposing to reduce legal migration to Australia and appointing a shadow minister for government efficiency, prompting his opponents to call him \u201cDOGE-y Dutton.\u201d",
      "Though Dutton says he\u2019s his \u201cown person,\u201d his association with Trump appears to have become a liability among Australian voters, said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University.",
      "\u201cDutton, perhaps overenthusiastically, endorsed President Trump\u2019s victory without recognizing how difficult that would make his position \u2014 not with the bolted-on right, but with the swing voters, the center of the center, where all elections are won in Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "A poll released last month by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States \u2014 the lowest in the annual poll\u2019s two-decade history.",
      "Blaxland described Trump\u2019s disregard for long-standing alliances and his quid pro quo approach to U.S. foreign policy as \u201cvertigo inducing\u201d for politicians, policymakers and voters in Australia, where voting is mandatory.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201chyperrealist, short-term, transactional approach to its relationships is deeply unsettling and corrosive of goodwill,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has treated Australia as just another freeloader, slapping a 10% tariff on all exports to the U.S., even though the U.S. generally runs a trade surplus with Australia rather than a deficit. (In a rare deviation, Australia reported Thursday that it sold more to the U.S. than it bought in the first quarter as investors spooked by Trump\u2019s tariffs rushed to buy gold, one of Australia\u2019s top metals exports.)",
      "While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia\u2019s security.",
      "Those numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.",
      "Albanese has spent his prime ministership working to stabilize relations with China, which nosedived under the previous conservative government, prompting China to impose punishing trade restrictions.",
      "China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 25% of the country\u2019s goods and services trade in 2023-24. The U.S. is Australia\u2019s third-largest two-way trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.",
      "If the United States, which has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, \u201creally damages the Chinese economy, then that is going to have a major impact on Australia,\u201d said Stuart Rollo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.",
      "Rollo said he worries Australia could be caught in the middle if the U.S. tries to pressure its allies to reduce their economic ties with Beijing.",
      "\u201cSo much of our future prosperity is tied with Chinese growth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor us to make the decision to disconnect from that \u2014 because we need American protection forever \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a real cost to the living standards of Australians moving forward.\u201d",
      "Without the U.S., however, Australia would be cut off from critical military technology and far less protected against Chinese aggression.",
      "Australia\u2019s vulnerability was on display in February when the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills off the country\u2019s coast, forcing dozens of commercial flights to reroute.",
      "That\u2019s why Australian politicians on both sides of the aisle say they remain committed to AUKUS, the security pact among Australia, the U.S. and Britain, even as Australians question whether they can still rely on the U.S. for their defense.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re this kind of Anglo, European-transplanted community sitting on the edge of Asia, and [that] drives our fear of abandonment, which drives us towards the United States,\u201d Blaxland said.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia is set to buy several nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. as a deterrent against China.",
      "But Australia would struggle to pay for those submarines without its trade relationship with China, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\u201cThis is a big cost problem for a small economy like Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go all in on AUKUS, all in on the United States, all in on containing China and imagine that our trade with China, which is paying for our submarines, can actually be sustained. It can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Both Albanese and Dutton have downplayed any uncertainty around U.S. relations, but Laurenceson believes cracks are emerging in bipartisan support for the alliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll say that our security alliance with the U.S. is much more than just about one administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but Trump is certainly challenging that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry has lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly-funded security detail at Britain\u2019s High Court.",
      "King Charles III\u2019s second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is currently the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the royal family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s company, News Group Newspapers, agreed to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to Harry after settling a long-running legal battle. NGN admitted that between 1996 and 2011, staff on The Sun newspapers used unlawful methods to dig up private information about Harry and his late mother, Princess Diana.The duke is also among a group of celebrities suing another publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which prints the Daily Mail, accusing it of lawbreaking in its attempts to gather information on them. The trial is due to start next year.",
      "In 2023, he dropped a libel case against ANL for its coverage of his legal battle over personal security. And the same year, he was awarded 140,600 pounds ($179,350) after successfully bringing a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers.",
      "Alongside these courtroom battles, Harry has endured a turbulent relationship with his own family since leaving the United Kingdom, including with his father, King Charles III who has been diagnosed with cancer."

    "summary": "Canadian Conservatives say they voted for the Mark Carney's Liberal party, with many describing it as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump,\" Pierre Poilievre.",
    "story": [
      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

      "The announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.",

      "He has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",

      "Chambers\u2019 supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, was not written by him.",
      "He had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.",
      "Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking.

      "\u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\u201d the U.S. State Department said after Chambers\u2019 arrest. \u201cWe continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\u201d",

Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.",
      "That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law."

      "Several countries were sending firefighting aircraft to Israel on Thursday as crews battled for a second day to extinguish a wildfire that had shut down a major highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and sent drivers scrambling from their cars.",
      "The fire broke out around midday on Wednesday, fueled by hot, dry conditions and fanned by strong winds that quickly whipped up the flames burning through a pine forest. Several communities were evacuated as a precaution as the smoke turned the skies over Jerusalem gray.",
      "Israel\u2019s Fire and Rescue Services warned the public to stay away from parks or forests, and to be exceptionally careful while lighting barbecues. Thursday is Israel\u2019s Independence Day, which is typically marked with large family cookouts in parks and forests.",
      "At least 12 people were treated in hospitals on Wednesday, mainly due to smoke inhalation, while another 10 people were treated in the field, Magen David Adom Ambulance services said."

      "While the ruling was cheered by some feminist groups, it has been condemned by trans-rights groups who said it would have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.",
      "The FA said its policy had been to make the sport accessible to as many people as possible but that it would make alterations if there were changes in law, science or the operations of \u201cgrassroots football.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify, and we are contacting the registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game,\u201d the FA said in a statement.",
      "It was not clear how many players would be affected by the policy that would take effect June 1."
